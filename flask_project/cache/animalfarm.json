["#$#$Chapter  1#$#$<br><br>M  r.  Jones,\nof  the  Manor  Farm,  had  locked  the\nhen-houses  for  the  night,  but  was  too\ndrunk  to  remember  to  shut  the  pop-\nholes.  With  the  ring  of  light  from  his\nlantern  dancing  from  side  to  side,  he\nlurched  across  the  yard,  kicked  off  his\nboots  at  the  back  door,  drew  himself  a\nlast  glass  of  beer  from  the  barrel  in  the\nscullery,  and  made  his  way  up  to  bed,\nwhere  Mrs.  Jones  was  already\nsnoring.<br><br>As  soon  as  the  light  in\nthe  bedroom  went  out  there  was  a\nstirring  and  a  fluttering  all  through  the\nfarm  buildings.  Word  had  gone  round\nduring  the  day  that  old  Major,  the  prize\nMiddle  White  boar,  had  had  a  strange\ndream  on  the  previous  night  and  wished\nto communicate it to the other animals. It\nhad  been  agreed  that  they  should  all\nmeet  in  the  big  barn  as  soon  as  Mr.\nJones  was  safely  out  of  the  way.  Old\nMajor  (so  he  was  always  called,  though\nthe  name  under  which  he  had  been\nexhibited was Willingdon Beauty) was so\nhighly  regarded  on  the  farm  that\neveryone  was  quite  ready  to  lose  an", "hour's sleep in order to hear what he had\nto  say.<br><br>At  one  end  of  the  big\nbarn,  on  a  sort  of  raised  platform,  Major\nwas  already  ensconced  on  his  bed  of\nstraw, under a lantern which hung from a\nbeam. He was twelve years old and had\nlately grown rather stout, but he was still\na  majestic-looking  pig,  with  a  wise  and\nbenevolent  appearance  in  spite  of  the\nfact  that  his  tushes  had  never  been  cut.\nBefore  long  the  other  animals  began  to\narrive and make themselves comfortable\nafter  their  different  fashions.  First  came\nthe  three  dogs,  Bluebell,  Jessie,  and\nPincher,  and  then  the  pigs,  who  settled\ndown in the straw immediately in front of\nthe  platform.  The  hens  perched\nthemselves  on  the  window-sills,  the\npigeons  fluttered  up  to  the  rafters,  the\nsheep  and  cows  lay  down  behind  the\npigs and began to chew the cud. The two\ncart-horses,  Boxer  and  Clover,  came  in\ntogether, walking very slowly and setting\ndown  their  vast  hairy  hoofs  with  great\ncare  lest  there  should  be  some  small\nanimal  concealed  in  the  straw.  Clover\nwas  a  stout  motherly  mare  approaching", "middle  life,  who  had  never  quite  got  her\nfigure  back  after  her  fourth  foal.  Boxer\nwas an enormous beast, nearly eighteen\nhands  high,  and  as  strong  as  any  two\nordinary  horses  put  together.  A  white\nstripe  down  his  nose  gave  him  a\nsomewhat stupid appearance, and in fact\nhe  was  not  of  first-rate  intelligence,  but\nhe  was  universally  respected  for  his\nsteadiness  of  character  and  tremendous\npowers  of  work.  After  the  horses\ncame<br><br>Muriel, the white goat, and\nBenjamin, the donkey. Benjamin was the\noldest animal on the farm, and the worst\ntempered.  He  seldom  talked,  and  when\nhe  did,  it  was  usually  to  make  some\ncynical  remark  -  for  instance,  he  would\nsay that God had given him a tail to keep\nthe  flies  off,  but  that  he  would  sooner\nhave  had  no  tail  and  no  flies.  Alone\namong the animals on the farm he never\nlaughed. If asked why, he would say that\nhe saw nothing to laugh at. Nevertheless,\nwithout  openly  admitting  it,  he  was\ndevoted to Boxer; the two of them usually\nspent their Sundays together in the small\npaddock  beyond  the  orchard,  grazing", "side  by  side  and  never\nspeaking.<br><br>The  two  horses  had\njust lain down when a brood of ducklings,\nwhich had lost their mother, filed into the\nbarn,  cheeping  feebly  and  wandering\nfrom  side  to  side  to  find  some  place\nwhere  they  would  not  be  trodden  on.\nClover  made  a  sort  of  wall  round  them\nwith  her  great  foreleg,  and  the  ducklings\nnestled  down  inside  it  and  promptly  fell\nasleep.  At  the  last  moment  Mollie,  the\nfoolish,  pretty  white  mare  who  drew  Mr.\nJones's  trap,  came  mincing  daintily  in,\nchewing  at  a  lump  of  sugar.  She  took  a\nplace near the front and began flirting her\nwhite  mane,  hoping  to  draw  attention  to\nthe  red  ribbons  it  was  plaited\nwith.<br><br>Last  of  all  came  the  cat,\nwho  looked  round,  as  usual,  for  the\nwarmest  place,  and  finally  squeezed\nherself  in  between  Boxer  and  Clover;\nthere  she  purred  contentedly  throughout\nMajor's  speech  without  listening  to  a\nword  of  what  he  was  saying.  All  the\nanimals were now present except Moses,\nthe  tame  raven,  who  slept  on  a  perch\nbehind  the  back  door.  When  Major  saw", "that  they  had  all  made  themselves\ncomfortable and were waiting attentively,\nhe  cleared  his  throat  and  began:\n\"Comrades,  you  have  heard  already\nabout  the  strange  dream  that  I  had  last\nnight. But I will come to the dream later. I\nhave something else to say first. I do not\nthink,  comrades,  that  I  shall  be  with  you\nfor many months longer, and before I die,\nI  feel  it  my  duty  to  pass  on  to  you  such\nwisdom as I have acquired. I have had a\nlong  life,  I  have  had  much  time  for\nthought  as  I  lay  alone  in  my  stall,  and  I\nthink  I  may  say  that  I  understand  the\nnature of life on this earth as well as any\nanimal  now  living.  It  is  about  this  that  I\nwish  to  speak  to  you.  \"Now,  comrades,\nwhat is the nature of this life of ours? Let\nus  face  it:  our  lives  are  miserable,\nlaborious,  and  short.  We  are  born,  we\nare given just so much food as will keep\nthe breath in our bodies, and those of us\nwho  are  capable  of  it  are  forced  to  work\nto  the  last  atom  of  our  strength;  and  the\nvery  instant  that  our  usefulness  has\ncome to an end we are slaughtered with\nhideous  cruelty.  No  animal  in  England", "knows  the  meaning  of  happiness  or\nleisure  after  he  is  a  year  old.  No  animal\nin<br><br>England is free. The life of an\nanimal  is  misery  and  slavery:  that  is  the\nplain  truth.  \"But  is  this  simply  part  of  the\norder of nature? Is it because this land of\nours  is  so  poor  that  it  cannot  afford  a\ndecent  life  to  those  who  dwell  upon  it?\nNo, comrades, a thousand times no! The\nsoil  of  England  is  fertile,  its  climate  is\ngood,  it  is  capable  of  affording  food  in\nabundance  to  an  enormously  greater\nnumber  of  animals  than  now  inhabit  it.\nThis single farm of ours would support a\ndozen  horses,  twenty  cows,  hundreds  of\nsheep - and all of them living in a comfort\nand a dignity that are now almost beyond\nour imagining. Why then do we continue\nin  this  miserable  condition?  Because\nnearly  the  whole  of  the  produce  of  our\nlabour  is  stolen  from  us  by  human\nbeings.  There,  comrades,  is  the  answer\nto all our problems. It is summed up in a\nsingle  word  -  Man.  Man  is  the  only  real\nenemy  we  have.  Remove  Man  from  the\nscene, and the root cause of hunger and\noverwork  is  abolished  for  ever.  \"Man  is", "the  only  creature  that  consumes  without\nproducing.  He  does  not  give  milk,  he\ndoes not lay eggs, he is too weak to pull\nthe plough, he cannot run fast enough to\ncatch  rabbits.  Yet  he  is  lord  of  all  the\nanimals. He sets them to work, he gives\nback  to  them  the  bare  minimum  that  will\nprevent  them  from  starving,  and  the  rest\nhe  keeps  for  himself.  Our  labour  tills  the\nsoil, our dung fertilises it, and yet there is\nnot  one  of  us  that  owns  more  than  his\nbare  skin.  You  cows  that  I  see  before\nme,  how  many  thousands  of  gallons  of\nmilk have you given during this last year?\nAnd  what  has  happened  to  that  milk\nwhich  should  have  been  breeding  up\nsturdy calves? Every drop of it has gone\ndown  the  throats  of  our  enemies.  And\nyou hens, how many eggs have you laid\nin this last year, and how many of those\neggs  ever  hatched  into  chickens?  The\nrest  have  all  gone  to  market  to  bring  in\nmoney  for  Jones  and  his  men.  And  you,\nClover,  where  are  those  four  foals  you\nbore, who should have been the support\nand pleasure of your old age? Each was\nsold  at  a  year  old  -  you  will  never  see", "one of them again. In return for your four\nconfinements  and  all  your  labour  in  the\nfields,  what  have  you  ever  had  except\nyour bare rations and a stall? \"And even\nthe  miserable  lives  we  lead  are  not\nallowed  to  reach  their  natural  span.  For\nmyself  I  do  not  grumble,  for  I  am  one  of\nthe lucky ones. I am twelve years old and\nhave  had  over  four  hundred  children.\nSuch  is  the  natural  life  of  a  pig.  But  no\nanimal  escapes  the  cruel  knife  in  the\nend.  You  young  porkers  who  are  sitting\nin  front  of  me,  every  one  of  you  will\nscream your lives out at the block within\na year. To that horror we all must come -\ncows, pigs, hens, sheep, everyone. Even\nthe  horses  and  the  dogs  have  no  better\nfate.  You,<br><br>Boxer,  the  very  day\nthat  those  great  muscles  of  yours  lose\ntheir  power,  Jones  will  sell  you  to  the\nknacker, who will cut your throat and boil\nyou  down  for  the  foxhounds.  As  for  the\ndogs, when they grow old and toothless,\nJones  ties  a  brick  round  their  necks  and\ndrowns  them  in  the  nearest  pond.  \"Is  it\nnot crystal clear, then, comrades, that all\nthe  evils  of  this  life  of  ours  spring  from", "the  tyranny  of  human  beings?  Only  get\nrid of Man, and the produce of our labour\nwould  be  our  own.  Almost  overnight  we\ncould  become  rich  and  free.  What  then\nmust  we  do?  Why,  work  night  and  day,\nbody  and  soul,  for  the  overthrow  of  the\nhuman race! That is my message to you,\ncomrades: Rebellion! I do not know when\nthat<br><br>Rebellion will come, it might\nbe in a week or in a hundred years, but I\nknow,  as  surely  as  I  see  this  straw\nbeneath  my  feet,  that  sooner  or  later\njustice  will  be  done.  Fix  your  eyes  on\nthat,  comrades,  throughout  the  short\nremainder  of  your  lives!  And  above  all,\npass  on  this  message  of  mine  to  those\nwho  come  after  you,  so  that  future\ngenerations  shall  carry  on  the  struggle\nuntil  it  is  victorious.  \"And  remember,\ncomrades,  your  resolution  must  never\nfalter. No argument must lead you astray.\nNever  listen  when  they  tell  you\nthat<br><br>Man and the animals have a\ncommon  interest,  that  the  prosperity  of\nthe one is the prosperity of the others. It\nis all lies. Man serves the interests of no\ncreature  except  himself.  And  among  us", "animals let there be perfect unity, perfect\ncomradeship in the struggle. All men are\nenemies.  All  animals  are\ncomrades.\"<br><br>At this moment there\nwas  a  tremendous  uproar.  While  Major\nwas  speaking  four  large  rats  had  crept\nout of their holes and were sitting on their\nhindquarters,  listening  to  him.  The  dogs\nhad suddenly caught sight of them, and it\nwas  only  by  a  swift  dash  for  their  holes\nthat  the  rats  saved  their  lives.  Major\nraised his trotter for silence. \"Comrades,\"\nhe  said,  \"here  is  a  point  that  must  be\nsettled.  The  wild  creatures,  such  as  rats\nand  rabbits  -  are  they  our  friends  or  our\nenemies?  Let  us  put  it  to  the  vote.  I\npropose this question to the meeting: Are\nrats  comrades?\"<br><br>The  vote  was\ntaken  at  once,  and  it  was  agreed  by  an\noverwhelming  majority  that  rats  were\ncomrades.  There  were  only  four\ndissentients,  the  three  dogs  and  the  cat,\nwho  was  afterwards  discovered  to  have\nvoted  on  both  sides.  Major  continued:  \"I\nhave  little  more  to  say.  I  merely  repeat,\nremember  always  your  duty  of  enmity\ntowards Man and all his ways. Whatever", "goes  upon  two  legs  is  an  enemy.\nWhatever  goes  upon  four  legs,  or  has\nwings,  is  a  friend.  And  remember  also\nthat in fighting against Man, we must not\ncome  to  resemble  him.  Even  when  you\nhave  conquered  him,  do  not  adopt  his\nvices.  No  animal  must  ever  live  in  a\nhouse, or sleep in a bed, or wear clothes,\nor  drink  alcohol,  or  smoke  tobacco,  or\ntouch money, or engage in trade. All the\nhabits of Man are evil. And, above all, no\nanimal must ever tyrannise over his own\nkind.  Weak  or  strong,  clever  or  simple,\nwe are all brothers. No animal must ever\nkill  any  other  animal.  All  animals  are\nequal. \"And now, comrades, I will tell you\nabout  my  dream  of  last  night.  I  cannot\ndescribe  that  dream  to  you.  It  was  a\ndream of the earth as it will be when Man\nhas  vanished.  But  it  reminded  me  of\nsomething  that  I  had  long  forgotten.\nMany  years  ago,  when  I  was  a  little  pig,\nmy  mother  and  the  other  sows  used  to\nsing an old song of which they knew only\nthe  tune  and  the  first  three  words.  I  had\nknown that tune in my infancy, but it had\nlong  since  passed  out  of  my  mind.  Last", "night, however, it came back to me in my\ndream.  And  what  is  more,  the  words  of\nthe  song  also  came  back-words,  I  am\ncertain,  which  were  sung  by  the  animals\nof  long  ago  and  have  been  lost  to\nmemory  for  generations.  I  will  sing  you\nthat  song  now,  comrades.  I  am  old  and\nmy  voice  is  hoarse,  but  when  I  have\ntaught you the tune, you can sing it better\nfor  yourselves.  It  is  called  'Beasts  of\nEngland'.\"<br><br>Old  Major  cleared  his\nthroat and began to sing. As he had said,\nhis  voice  was  hoarse,  but  he  sang  well\nenough,  and  it  was  a  stirring  tune,\nsomething  between  'Clementine'  and  'La\nCucaracha'.  The  words\nran:<br><br>Beasts  of  England,  beasts\nof  Ireland,<br><br>Beasts  of  every  land\nand  clime,<br><br>Hearken  to  my  joyful\ntidings<br><br>Of  the  golden  future\ntime.<br><br>Soon  or  late  the  day  is\ncoming,<br><br>Tyrant  Man  shall  be\no'erthrown,<br><br>And the fruitful fields\nof  England<br><br>Shall  be  trod  by\nbeasts alone.<br><br>Rings shall vanish\nfrom our noses,<br><br>And the harness\nfrom our back,<br><br>Bit and spur shall", "rust  forever,<br><br>Cruel  whips  no\nmore  shall  crack.<br><br>Riches  more\nthan  mind  can  picture,<br><br>Wheat\nand  barley,  oats  and\nhay,<br><br>Clover,  beans,  and\nmangel-wurzels<br><br>Shall  be  ours\nupon  that  day.<br><br>Bright  will  shine\nthe fields of England,<br><br>Purer shall\nits  waters  be,<br><br>Sweeter  yet  shall\nblow its breezes<br><br>On the day that\nsets  us  free.<br><br>For  that  day  we  all\nmust  labour,<br><br>Though  we  die\nbefore  it  break;<br><br>Cows  and\nhorses,  geese  and  turkeys,  All  must  toil\nfor  freedom's  sake.<br><br>Beasts  of\nEngland,  beasts  of\nIreland,<br><br>Beasts  of  every  land\nand  clime,<br><br>Hearken  well  and\nspread  my  tidings<br><br>Of  the  golden\nfuture  time.<br><br>The  singing  of  this\nsong  threw  the  animals  into  the  wildest\nexcitement.<br><br>Almost before Major\nhad  reached  the  end,  they  had  begun\nsinging  it  for  themselves.  Even  the\nstupidest  of  them  had  already  picked  up\nthe tune and a few of the words, and as\nfor the clever ones, such as the pigs and", "dogs,  they  had  the  entire  song  by  heart\nwithin  a  few  minutes.  And  then,  after  a\nfew  preliminary  tries,  the  whole  farm\nburst  out  into  'Beasts  of  England'  in\ntremendous  unison.  The  cows  lowed  it,\nthe  dogs  whined  it,  the  sheep  bleated  it,\nthe  horses  whinnied  it,  the  ducks\nquacked  it.  They  were  so  delighted  with\nthe  song  that  they  sang  it  right  through\nfive times in succession, and might have\ncontinued  singing  it  all  night  if  they  had\nnot  been\ninterrupted.<br><br>Unfortunately,  the\nuproar awoke Mr. Jones, who sprang out\nof bed, making sure that there was a fox\nin  the  yard.  He  seized  the  gun  which\nalways stood in a corner of his bedroom,\nand let fly a charge of number 6 shot into\nthe  darkness.  The  pellets  buried\nthemselves  in  the  wall  of  the  barn  and\nthe meeting broke up hurriedly. Everyone\nfled to his own sleeping-place. The birds\njumped  on  to  their  perches,  the  animals\nsettled down in the straw, and the whole\nfarm was asleep in a moment.  ", "#$#$Chapter  2#$#$<br><br>T  hree\nnights  later  old  Major  died  peacefully  in\nhis sleep. His body was buried at the foot\nof the orchard.<br><br>This was early in\nMarch.  During  the  next  three  months\nthere  was  much  secret  activity.  Major's\nspeech  had  given  to  the  more  intelligent\nanimals  on  the  farm  a  completely  new\noutlook  on  life.  They  did  not  know  when\nthe  Rebellion  predicted  by  Major  would\ntake  place,  they  had  no  reason  for\nthinking  that  it  would  be  within  their  own\nlifetime,  but  they  saw  clearly  that  it  was\ntheir  duty  to  prepare  for  it.<br><br>The\nwork  of  teaching  and  organising  the\nothers  fell  naturally  upon  the  pigs,  who\nwere  generally  recognised  as  being  the\ncleverest  of  the  animals.  Pre-eminent\namong  the  pigs  were  two  young  boars\nnamed<br><br>Snowball  and  Napoleon,\nwhom  Mr.  Jones  was  breeding  up  for\nsale.<br><br>Napoleon  was  a  large,\nrather  fierce-looking  Berkshire  boar,  the\nonly<br><br>Berkshire  on  the  farm,  not\nmuch of a talker, but with a reputation for\ngetting  his  own  way.  Snowball  was  a\nmore  vivacious  pig", "than<br><br>Napoleon,  quicker  in\nspeech  and  more  inventive,  but  was  not\nconsidered  to  have  the  same  depth  of\ncharacter. All the other male pigs on the\nfarm  were  porkers.  The  best  known\namong  them  was  a  small  fat  pig  named\nSquealer,  with  very  round  cheeks,\ntwinkling eyes, nimble movements, and a\nshrill voice. He was a brilliant talker, and\nwhen he was arguing some difficult point\nhe  had  a  way  of  skipping  from  side  to\nside  and  whisking  his  tail  which  was\nsomehow  very  persuasive.  The  others\nsaid of Squealer that he could turn black\ninto  white.<br><br>These  three  had\nelaborated  old  Major's  teachings  into  a\ncomplete  system  of  thought,  to  which\nthey  gave  the  name  of  Animalism.\nSeveral  nights  a  week,  after  Mr.  Jones\nwas asleep, they held secret meetings in\nthe barn and expounded the principles of\nAnimalism to the others. At the beginning\nthey met with much stupidity and apathy.\nSome of the animals talked of the duty of\nloyalty to Mr. Jones, whom they referred\nto  as  \"Master,\"  or  made  elementary\nremarks  such  as  \"Mr.  Jones  feeds  us.  If", "he  were  gone,  we  should  starve  to\ndeath.\"  Others  asked  such  questions  as\n\"Why should we care what happens after\nwe  are  dead?\"  or  \"If  this  Rebellion  is  to\nhappen  anyway,  what  difference  does  it\nmake  whether  we  work  for  it  or  not?\",\nand  the  pigs  had  great  difficulty  in\nmaking  them  see  that  this  was  contrary\nto  the  spirit  of  Animalism.  The  stupidest\nquestions of all were asked by Mollie, the\nwhite  mare.  The  very  first  question  she\nasked  Snowball  was:  \"Will  there  still  be\nsugar  after  the  Rebellion?\"  \"No,\"  said\nSnowball  firmly.  \"We  have  no  means  of\nmaking sugar on this farm. Besides, you\ndo  not  need  sugar.  You  will  have  all  the\noats and hay you want.\" \"And shall I still\nbe allowed to wear ribbons in my mane?\"\nasked<br><br>Mollie.  \"Comrade,\"  said\nSnowball, \"those ribbons that you are so\ndevoted to are the badge of slavery. Can\nyou  not  understand  that  liberty  is  worth\nmore  than  ribbons?\"<br><br>Mollie\nagreed,  but  she  did  not  sound  very\nconvinced.<br><br>The  pigs  had  an\neven  harder  struggle  to  counteract  the\nlies put about by Moses, the tame raven.", "Moses,  who  was  Mr.  Jones's  especial\npet, was a spy and a tale-bearer, but he\nwas  also  a  clever  talker.  He  claimed  to\nknow  of  the  existence  of  a  mysterious\ncountry  called<br><br>Sugarcandy\nMountain,  to  which  all  animals  went\nwhen  they  died.  It  was  situated\nsomewhere up in the sky, a little distance\nbeyond  the  clouds,  Moses  said.  In\nSugarcandy  Mountain  it  was  Sunday\nseven days a week, clover was in season\nall  the  year  round,  and  lump  sugar  and\nlinseed  cake  grew  on  the  hedges.  The\nanimals  hated  Moses  because  he  told\ntales and did no work, but some of them\nbelieved  in\nSugarcandy<br><br>Mountain,  and  the\npigs had to argue very hard to persuade\nthem  that  there  was  no  such\nplace.<br><br>Their  most  faithful\ndisciples were the two cart-horses, Boxer\nand<br><br>Clover. These two had great\ndifficulty  in  thinking  anything  out  for\nthemselves,  but  having  once  accepted\nthe pigs as their teachers, they absorbed\neverything  that  they  were  told,  and\npassed  it  on  to  the  other  animals  by", "simple arguments. They were unfailing in\ntheir attendance at the secret meetings in\nthe  barn,  and  led  the  singing  of  'Beasts\nof<br><br>England',  with  which  the\nmeetings  always  ended.<br><br>Now,\nas  it  turned  out,  the  Rebellion  was\nachieved  much  earlier  and  more  easily\nthan anyone had expected. In past years\nMr.  Jones,  although  a  hard  master,  had\nbeen a capable farmer, but of late he had\nfallen on evil days. He had become much\ndisheartened  after  losing  money  in  a\nlawsuit,  and  had  taken  to  drinking  more\nthan was good for him. For whole days at\na  time  he  would  lounge  in  his  Windsor\nchair  in  the  kitchen,  reading  the\nnewspapers,  drinking,  and  occasionally\nfeeding Moses on crusts of bread soaked\nin beer. His men were idle and dishonest,\nthe  fields  were  full  of  weeds,  the\nbuildings  wanted  roofing,  the  hedges\nwere  neglected,  and  the  animals  were\nunderfed.<br><br>June  came  and  the\nhay  was  almost  ready  for  cutting.\nOn<br><br>Midsummer's  Eve,  which\nwas  a  Saturday,  Mr.  Jones  went\ninto<br><br>Willingdon and got so drunk", "at  the  Red  Lion  that  he  did  not  come\nback till midday on Sunday. The men had\nmilked the cows in the early morning and\nthen  had  gone  out  rabbiting,  without\nbothering to feed the animals. When Mr.\nJones  got  back  he  immediately  went  to\nsleep  on  the  drawing-room  sofa  with  the\nNews of the World over his face, so that\nwhen  evening  came,  the  animals  were\nstill  unfed.  At  last  they  could  stand  it  no\nlonger. One of the cows broke in the door\nof  the  store-  shed  with  her  horn  and  all\nthe  animals  began  to  help  themselves\nfrom  the  bins.  It  was  just  then  that  Mr.\nJones woke up. The next moment he and\nhis four men were in the store-shed with\nwhips  in  their  hands,  lashing  out  in  all\ndirections.  This  was  more  than  the\nhungry  animals  could  bear.  With  one\naccord,  though  nothing  of  the  kind  had\nbeen  planned  beforehand,  they  flung\nthemselves  upon  their\ntormentors.<br><br>Jones  and  his  men\nsuddenly  found  themselves  being  butted\nand  kicked  from  all  sides.  The  situation\nwas  quite  out  of  their  control.  They  had\nnever  seen  animals  behave  like  this", "before,  and  this  sudden  uprising  of\ncreatures  whom  they  were  used  to\nthrashing  and  maltreating  just  as  they\nchose,  frightened  them  almost  out  of\ntheir  wits.  After  only  a  moment  or  two\nthey gave up trying to defend themselves\nand took to their heels. A minute later all\nfive  of  them  were  in  full  flight  down  the\ncart-track  that  led  to  the  main  road,  with\nthe  animals  pursuing  them  in\ntriumph.<br><br>Mrs.  Jones  looked  out\nof  the  bedroom  window,  saw  what  was\nhappening,  hurriedly  flung  a  few\npossessions  into  a  carpet  bag,  and\nslipped  out  of  the  farm  by  another  way.\nMoses  sprang  off  his  perch  and  flapped\nafter her, croaking loudly. Meanwhile the\nanimals  had  chased<br><br>Jones  and\nhis men out on to the road and slammed\nthe  five-barred  gate  behind  them.  And\nso,  almost  before  they  knew  what  was\nhappening,  the  Rebellion  had  been\nsuccessfully  carried  through:  Jones  was\nexpelled,  and  the  Manor  Farm  was\ntheirs.<br><br>For  the  first  few  minutes\nthe  animals  could  hardly  believe  in  their\ngood fortune. Their first act was to gallop", "in  a  body  right  round  the  boundaries  of\nthe  farm,  as  though  to  make  quite  sure\nthat  no  human  being  was  hiding\nanywhere  upon  it;  then  they  raced  back\nto the farm buildings to wipe out the last\ntraces  of  Jones's  hated  reign.  The\nharness-room  at  the  end  of  the  stables\nwas  broken  open;  the  bits,  the\nnose-rings,  the  dog-chains,  the  cruel\nknives  with  which  Mr.  Jones  had  been\nused  to  castrate  the  pigs  and  lambs,\nwere all flung down the well.<br><br>The\nreins,  the  halters,  the  blinkers,  the\ndegrading  nosebags,  were  thrown  on  to\nthe rubbish fire which was burning in the\nyard. So were the whips. All the animals\ncapered  with  joy  when  they  saw  the\nwhips  going  up  in  flames.  Snowball  also\nthrew  on  to  the  fire  the  ribbons  with\nwhich  the  horses'  manes  and  tails  had\nusually  been  decorated  on  market  days.\n\"Ribbons,\"  he  said,  \"should  be\nconsidered  as  clothes,  which  are  the\nmark  of  a  human  being.  All  animals\nshould  go  naked.\"<br><br>When  Boxer\nheard this he fetched the small straw hat\nwhich  he  wore  in  summer  to  keep  the", "flies out of his ears, and flung it on to the\nfire  with  the  rest.<br><br>In  a  very  little\nwhile  the  animals  had  destroyed\neverything  that  reminded  them  of  Mr.\nJones.  Napoleon  then  led  them  back  to\nthe  store-shed  and  served  out  a  double\nration  of  corn  to  everybody,  with  two\nbiscuits  for  each  dog.  Then  they  sang\n'Beasts  of  England'  from  end  to  end\nseven  times  running,  and  after  that  they\nsettled  down  for  the  night  and  slept  as\nthey had never slept before.<br><br>But\nthey  woke  at  dawn  as  usual,  and\nsuddenly remembering the glorious thing\nthat  had  happened,  they  all  raced  out\ninto  the  pasture  together.  A  little  way\ndown  the  pasture  there  was  a  knoll  that\ncommanded  a  view  of  most  of  the  farm.\nThe  animals  rushed  to  the  top  of  it  and\ngazed  round  them  in  the  clear  morning\nlight.  Yes,  it  was  theirs  -  everything  that\nthey could see was theirs! In the ecstasy\nof that thought they gambolled round and\nround, they hurled themselves into the air\nin  great  leaps  of  excitement.  They  rolled\nin the dew, they cropped mouthfuls of the\nsweet  summer  grass,  they  kicked  up", "clods  of  the  black  earth  and  snuffed  its\nrich  scent.  Then  they  made  a  tour  of\ninspection  of  the  whole  farm  and\nsurveyed with speechless admiration the\nploughland, the hayfield, the orchard, the\npool,  the  spinney.  It  was  as  though  they\nhad never seen these things before, and\neven now they could hardly believe that it\nwas all their own.<br><br>Then they filed\nback  to  the  farm  buildings  and  halted  in\nsilence  outside  the  door  of  the\nfarmhouse. That was theirs too, but they\nwere  frightened  to  go  inside.  After  a\nmoment,  however,  Snowball  and\nNapoleon butted the door open with their\nshoulders  and  the  animals  entered  in\nsingle  file,  walking  with  the  utmost  care\nfor  fear  of  disturbing  anything.  They\ntiptoed  from  room  to  room,  afraid  to\nspeak above a whisper and gazing with a\nkind of awe at the unbelievable luxury, at\nthe  beds  with  their  feather  mattresses,\nthe  looking-glasses,  the  horsehair  sofa,\nthe  Brussels  carpet,  the  lithograph  of\nQueen<br><br>Victoria  over  the\ndrawing-room  mantelpiece.  They  were\nlust  coming  down  the  stairs  when  Mollie", "was  discovered  to  be  missing.  Going\nback,  the  others  found  that  she  had\nremained  behind  in  the  best\nbedroom.<br><br>She had taken a piece\nof  blue  ribbon  from  Mrs.  Jones's\ndressing-table, and was holding it against\nher  shoulder  and  admiring  herself  in  the\nglass  in  a  very  foolish  manner.  The\nothers  reproached  her  sharply,  and  they\nwent outside. Some hams hanging in the\nkitchen were taken out for burial, and the\nbarrel of beer in the scullery was stove in\nwith  a  kick  from  Boxer's  hoof,  otherwise\nnothing  in  the  house  was  touched.  A\nunanimous resolution was passed on the\nspot  that  the  farmhouse  should  be\npreserved as a museum. All were agreed\nthat  no  animal  must  ever  live\nthere.<br><br>The  animals  had  their\nbreakfast,  and  then  Snowball  and\nNapoleon  called  them  together  again.\n\"Comrades,\"  said  Snowball,  \"it  is\nhalf-past  six  and  we  have  a  long  day\nbefore  us.  Today  we  begin  the  hay\nharvest.  But  there  is  another  matter  that\nmust  be  attended  to  first.\"<br><br>The\npigs  now  revealed  that  during  the  past", "three months they had taught themselves\nto  read  and  write  from  an  old  spelling\nbook which had belonged to Mr. Jones's\nchildren  and  which  had  been  thrown  on\nthe rubbish heap. Napoleon sent for pots\nof black and white paint and led the way\ndown to the five-barred gate that gave on\nto the main road.<br><br>Then Snowball\n(for  it  was  Snowball  who  was  best  at\nwriting)  took  a  brush  between  the  two\nknuckles  of  his  trotter,  painted  out\nMANOR<br><br>FARM from the top bar\nof  the  gate  and  in  its  place  painted\nANIMAL FARM. This was to be the name\nof the farm from now onwards. After this\nthey  went  back  to  the  farm  buildings,\nwhere  Snowball  and<br><br>Napoleon\nsent for a ladder which they caused to be\nset  against  the  end  wall  of  the  big  barn.\nThey  explained  that  by  their  studies  of\nthe  past  three  months  the  pigs  had\nsucceeded  in  reducing  the  principles\nof<br><br>Animalism  to  Seven\nCommandments.  These  Seven\nCommandments would now be inscribed\non  the  wall;  they  would  form  an\nunalterable  law  by  which  all  the  animals", "on  Animal  Farm  must  live  for  ever\nafter.<br><br>With  some  difficulty  (for  it\nis  not  easy  for  a  pig  to  balance  himself\non a ladder) Snowball climbed up and set\nto work, with Squealer a few rungs below\nhim  holding  the  paint-pot.  The\nCommandments  were  written  on  the\ntarred  wall  in  great  white  letters  that\ncould be read thirty yards away. They ran\nthus:<br><br>THE  SEVEN\nCOMMANDMENTS  1.  Whatever  goes\nupon two legs is an enemy. 2. Whatever\ngoes  upon  four  legs,  or  has  wings,  is  a\nfriend. 3. No animal shall wear clothes. 4.\nNo  animal  shall  sleep  in  a  bed.  5.  No\nanimal  shall  drink  alcohol.  6.  No  animal\nshall kill any other animal. 7. All animals\nare  equal.<br><br>It  was  very  neatly\nwritten,  and  except  that  \"friend\"  was\nwritten  \"freind\"  and  one  of  the  \"S's\"  was\nthe  wrong  way  round,  the  spelling  was\ncorrect  all  the  way  through.  Snowball\nread it aloud for the benefit of the others.\nAll  the  animals  nodded  in  complete\nagreement,  and  the  cleverer  ones  at\nonce began to learn the Commandments\nby  heart.  \"Now,  comrades,\"  cried", "Snowball, throwing down the paint-brush,\n\"to the hayfield! Let us make it a point of\nhonour to get in the harvest more quickly\nthan Jones and his men could do.\" ", "#$#$Chapter  3#$#$<br><br>H  ow  they\ntoiled and sweated to get the hay in! But\ntheir  efforts  were  rewarded,  for  the\nharvest was an even bigger success than\nthey  had  hoped.<br><br>Sometimes  the\nwork was hard; the implements had been\ndesigned  for  human  beings  and  not  for\nanimals,  and  it  was  a  great  drawback\nthat  no  animal  was  able  to  use  any  tool\nthat  involved  standing  on  his  hind  legs.\nBut  the  pigs  were  so  clever  that  they\ncould  think  of  a  way  round  every\ndifficulty.  As  for  the  horses,  they  knew\nevery  inch  of  the  field,  and  in  fact\nunderstood  the  business  of  mowing  and\nraking far better than Jones and his men\nhad ever done. The pigs did not actually\nwork,  but  directed  and  supervised  the\nothers.  With  their  superior  knowledge  it\nwas natural that they should assume the\nleadership.<br><br>Boxer  and  Clover\nwould  harness  themselves  to  the  cutter\nor  the  horse-  rake  (no  bits  or  reins  were\nneeded  in  these  days,  of  course)  and\ntramp  steadily  round  and  round  the  field\nwith a pig walking behind and calling out\n\"Gee  up,  comrade!\"  or  \"Whoa  back,", "comrade!\"  as  the  case  might  be.  And\nevery  animal  down  to  the  humblest\nworked  at  turning  the  hay  and  gathering\nit. Even the ducks and hens toiled to and\nfro all day in the sun, carrying tiny wisps\nof  hay  in  their  beaks.  In  the  end  they\nfinished the harvest in two days' less time\nthan  it  had  usually  taken<br><br>Jones\nand  his  men.  Moreover,  it  was  the\nbiggest  harvest  that  the  farm  had  ever\nseen.  There  was  no  wastage  whatever;\nthe hens and ducks with their sharp eyes\nhad  gathered  up  the  very  last  stalk.  And\nnot an animal on the farm had stolen so\nmuch  as  a  mouthful.<br><br>All  through\nthat  summer  the  work  of  the  farm  went\nlike  clockwork.  The  animals  were  happy\nas  they  had  never  conceived  it  possible\nto  be.  Every  mouthful  of  food  was  an\nacute  positive  pleasure,  now  that  it  was\ntruly  their  own  food,  produced  by\nthemselves  and  for  themselves,  not\ndoled out to them by a grudging master.\nWith  the  worthless  parasitical  human\nbeings  gone,  there  was  more  for\neveryone to eat. There was more leisure\ntoo,  inexperienced  though  the  animals", "were.  They  met  with  many  difficulties  -\nfor instance, later in the year, when they\nharvested  the  corn,  they  had  to  tread  it\nout  in  the  ancient  style  and  blow  away\nthe chaff with their breath, since the farm\npossessed  no  threshing  machine  -  but\nthe  pigs  with  their  cleverness  and  Boxer\nwith  his  tremendous  muscles  always\npulled  them  through.<br><br>Boxer  was\nthe  admiration  of  everybody.  He  had\nbeen a hard worker even in Jones's time,\nbut  now  he  seemed  more  like  three\nhorses  than  one;  there  were  days  when\nthe  entire  work  of  the  farm  seemed  to\nrest  on  his  mighty  shoulders.  From\nmorning  to  night  he  was  pushing  and\npulling,  always  at  the  spot  where  the\nwork  was  hardest.  He  had  made  an\narrangement with one of the cockerels to\ncall  him  in  the  mornings  half  an  hour\nearlier  than  anyone  else,  and  would  put\nin  some  volunteer  labour  at  whatever\nseemed  to  be  most  needed,  before  the\nregular  day's  work  began.  His  answer  to\nevery problem, every setback, was \"I will\nwork  harder!\"-  which  he  had  adopted  as\nhis  personal  motto.<br><br>But", "everyone  worked  according  to  his\ncapacity.  The  hens  and  ducks,  for\ninstance,  saved  five  bushels  of  corn  at\nthe  harvest  by  gathering  up  the  stray\ngrains.  Nobody  stole,  nobody  grumbled\nover his rations, the quarrelling and biting\nand  jealousy  which  had  been  normal\nfeatures of life in the old days had almost\ndisappeared. Nobody shirked - or almost\nnobody. Mollie, it was true, was not good\nat getting up in the mornings, and had a\nway  of  leaving  work  early  on  the  ground\nthat  there  was  a  stone  in  her  hoof.  And\nthe  behaviour  of  the  cat  was  somewhat\npeculiar.  It  was  soon  noticed  that  when\nthere was work to be done the cat could\nnever  be  found.  She  would  vanish  for\nhours  on  end,  and  then  reappear  at\nmeal-times,  or  in  the  evening  after  work\nwas  over,  as  though  nothing  had\nhappened.  But  she  always  made  such\nexcellent  excuses,  and  purred  so\naffectionately,  that  it  was  impossible  not\nto  believe  in  her  good  intentions.  Old\nBenjamin,  the  donkey,  seemed  quite\nunchanged  since  the  Rebellion.  He  did\nhis work in the same slow obstinate way", "as he had done it in Jones's time, never\nshirking  and  never  volunteering  for  extra\nwork  either.  About  the<br><br>Rebellion\nand  its  results  he  would  express  no\nopinion. When asked whether he was not\nhappier  now  that  Jones  was  gone,  he\nwould say only \"Donkeys live a long time.\nNone  of  you  has  ever  seen  a  dead\ndonkey,\"  and  the  others  had  to  be\ncontent  with  this  cryptic\nanswer.<br><br>On  Sundays  there  was\nno  work.  Breakfast  was  an  hour  later\nthan usual, and after breakfast there was\na  ceremony  which  was  observed  every\nweek without fail. First came the hoisting\nof  the  flag.  Snowball  had  found  in  the\nharness-room  an  old  green  tablecloth  of\nMrs. Jones's and had painted on it a hoof\nand a horn in white. This was run up the\nflagstaff  in  the  farmhouse  garden  every\nSunday  morning.  The  flag  was  green,\nSnowball  explained,  to  represent  the\ngreen  fields  of  England,  while  the  hoof\nand  horn  signified  the  future  Republic  of\nthe  Animals  which  would  arise  when  the\nhuman  race  had  been  finally\noverthrown.<br><br>After  the  hoisting  of", "the  flag  all  the  animals  trooped  into  the\nbig  barn  for  a  general  assembly  which\nwas  known  as  the  Meeting.  Here  the\nwork  of  the  coming  week  was  planned\nout and resolutions were put forward and\ndebated. It was always the pigs who put\nforward  the  resolutions.  The  other\nanimals  understood  how  to  vote,  but\ncould  never  think  of  any  resolutions  of\ntheir  own.  Snowball  and  Napoleon  were\nby far the most active in the debates. But\nit was noticed that these two were never\nin agreement: whatever suggestion either\nof  them  made,  the  other  could  be\ncounted  on  to  oppose  it.  Even  when  it\nwas  resolved  -  a  thing  no  one  could\nobject to in itself - to set aside the small\npaddock  behind  the  orchard  as  a  home\nof  rest  for  animals  who  were  past  work,\nthere  was  a  stormy  debate  over  the\ncorrect  retiring  age  for  each  class  of\nanimal.  The  Meeting  always  ended  with\nthe  singing  of  'Beasts  of  England',  and\nthe  afternoon  was  given  up  to\nrecreation.<br><br>The  pigs  had  set\naside  the  harness-room  as  a\nheadquarters  for  themselves.  Here,  in", "the evenings, they studied blacksmithing,\ncarpentering,  and  other  necessary  arts\nfrom books which they had brought out of\nthe  farmhouse.  Snowball  also  busied\nhimself with organising the other animals\ninto  what  he  called  Animal\nCommittees.<br><br>He  was\nindefatigable  at  this.  He  formed  the  Egg\nProduction  Committee  for  the  hens,  the\nClean  Tails  League  for  the  cows,  the\nWild  Comrades'<br><br>Re-education\nCommittee  (the  object  of  this  was  to\ntame  the  rats  and  rabbits),  the  Whiter\nWool  Movement  for  the  sheep,  and\nvarious  others,  besides  instituting\nclasses  in  reading  and  writing.  On  the\nwhole, these projects were a failure. The\nattempt  to  tame  the  wild  creatures,  for\ninstance,  broke  down  almost\nimmediately.  They  continued  to  behave\nvery  much  as  before,  and  when  treated\nwith generosity, simply took advantage of\nit.  The  cat  joined  the  Re-education\nCommittee  and  was  very  active  in  it  for\nsome  days.  She  was  seen  one  day\nsitting  on  a  roof  and  talking  to  some\nsparrows who were just out of her reach.", "She  was  telling  them  that  all  animals\nwere  now  comrades  and  that  any\nsparrow  who  chose  could  come  and\nperch on her paw; but the sparrows kept\ntheir  distance.<br><br>The  reading  and\nwriting  classes,  however,  were  a  great\nsuccess.  By  the  autumn  almost  every\nanimal  on  the  farm  was  literate  in  some\ndegree.<br><br>As  for  the  pigs,  they\ncould  already  read  and  write  perfectly.\nThe  dogs  learned  to  read  fairly  well,  but\nwere  not  interested  in  reading  anything\nexcept  the  Seven  Commandments.\nMuriel,  the  goat,  could  read  somewhat\nbetter  than  the  dogs,  and  sometimes\nused  to  read  to  the  others  in  the\nevenings  from  scraps  of  newspaper\nwhich  she  found  on  the  rubbish  heap.\nBenjamin  could  read  as  well  as  any  pig,\nbut never exercised his faculty. So far as\nhe  knew,  he  said,  there  was  nothing\nworth  reading.  Clover  learnt  the  whole\nalphabet,  but  could  not  put  words\ntogether. Boxer could not get beyond the\nletter D. He would trace out A, B, C, D, in\nthe  dust  with  his  great  hoof,  and  then\nwould stand staring at the letters with his", "ears  back,  sometimes  shaking  his\nforelock,  trying  with  all  his  might  to\nremember  what  came  next  and  never\nsucceeding.  On  several  occasions,\nindeed,  he  did  learn  E,  F,  G,  H,  but  by\nthe  time  he  knew  them,  it  was  always\ndiscovered that he had forgotten A, B, C,\nand  D.  Finally  he  decided  to  be  content\nwith  the  first  four  letters,  and  used  to\nwrite them out once or twice every day to\nrefresh  his  memory.  Mollie  refused  to\nlearn  any  but  the  six  letters  which  spelt\nher  own  name.  She  would  form  these\nvery  neatly  out  of  pieces  of  twig,  and\nwould  then  decorate  them  with  a  flower\nor  two  and  walk  round  them  admiring\nthem.<br><br>None of the other animals\non  the  farm  could  get  further  than  the\nletter  A.  It  was  also  found  that  the\nstupider  animals,  such  as  the  sheep,\nhens,  and  ducks,  were  unable  to  learn\nthe  Seven  Commandments  by  heart.\nAfter  much  thought  Snowball  declared\nthat  the  Seven<br><br>Commandments\ncould  in  effect  be  reduced  to  a  single\nmaxim,  namely:  \"Four  legs  good,  two\nlegs  bad.\"  This,  he  said,  contained  the", "essential  principle  of  Animalism.\nWhoever  had  thoroughly  grasped  it\nwould  be  safe  from  human  influences.\nThe  birds  at  first  objected,  since  it\nseemed  to  them  that  they  also  had  two\nlegs,  but  Snowball  proved  to  them  that\nthis  was  not  so.  \"A  bird's  wing,\ncomrades,\"  he  said,  \"is  an  organ  of\npropulsion  and  not  of  manipulation.  It\nshould  therefore  be  regarded  as  a  leg.\nThe  distinguishing  mark  of  man  is  the\nHAND,  the  instrument  with  which  he\ndoes  all  his  mischief.\"<br><br>The  birds\ndid  not  understand  Snowball's  long\nwords, but they accepted his explanation,\nand  all  the  humbler  animals  set  to  work\nto  learn  the  new  maxim  by  heart.  FOUR\nLEGS  GOOD,  TWO  LEGS  BAD,  was\ninscribed  on  the  end  wall  of  the  barn,\nabove  the\nSeven<br><br>Commandments  and  in\nbigger letters. When they had once got it\nby  heart,  the  sheep  developed  a  great\nliking  for  this  maxim,  and  often  as  they\nlay  in  the  field  they  would  all  start\nbleating  \"Four  legs  good,  two  legs  bad!\nFour legs good, two legs bad!\" and keep", "it  up  for  hours  on  end,  never  growing\ntired  of  it.<br><br>Napoleon  took  no\ninterest  in  Snowball's  committees.  He\nsaid that the education of the young was\nmore  important  than  anything  that  could\nbe  done  for  those  who  were  already\ngrown  up.  It  happened\nthat<br><br>Jessie  and  Bluebell  had\nboth whelped soon after the hay harvest,\ngiving  birth  between  them  to  nine  sturdy\npuppies.  As  soon  as  they  were  weaned,\nNapoleon  took  them  away  from  their\nmothers,  saying  that  he  would  make\nhimself  responsible  for  their  education.\nHe  took  them  up  into  a  loft  which  could\nonly  be  reached  by  a  ladder  from  the\nharness-  room,  and  there  kept  them  in\nsuch  seclusion  that  the  rest  of  the  farm\nsoon  forgot  their  existence.<br><br>The\nmystery  of  where  the  milk  went  to  was\nsoon cleared up. It was mixed every day\ninto  the  pigs'  mash.  The  early  apples\nwere  now  ripening,  and  the  grass  of  the\norchard  was  littered  with  windfalls.  The\nanimals  had  assumed  as  a  matter  of\ncourse  that  these  would  be  shared  out\nequally;  one  day,  however,  the  order", "went forth that all the windfalls were to be\ncollected  and  brought  to  the\nharness-room  for  the  use  of  the  pigs.  At\nthis  some  of  the  other  animals\nmurmured, but it was no use. All the pigs\nwere in full agreement on this point, even\nSnowball  and  Napoleon.  Squealer  was\nsent to make the necessary explanations\nto the others. \"Comrades!\" he cried. \"You\ndo  not  imagine,  I  hope,  that  we  pigs  are\ndoing  this  in  a  spirit  of  selfishness  and\nprivilege? Many of us actually dislike milk\nand  apples.  I  dislike  them  myself.  Our\nsole  object  in  taking  these  things  is  to\npreserve our health. Milk and apples (this\nhas been proved by Science, comrades)\ncontain substances absolutely necessary\nto  the  well-being  of  a  pig.  We  pigs  are\nbrainworkers.  The  whole  management\nand  organisation  of  this  farm  depend  on\nus.  Day  and  night  we  are  watching  over\nyour welfare. It is for YOUR sake that we\ndrink  that  milk  and  eat  those  apples.  Do\nyou know what would ", "#$#$Chapter  4#$#$<br><br>B  y  the  late\nsummer the news of what had happened\non  Animal<br><br>Farm  had  spread\nacross  half  the  county.  Every  day\nSnowball  and  Napoleon  sent  out  flights\nof  pigeons  whose  instructions  were  to\nmingle  with  the  animals  on  neighbouring\nfarms,  tell  them  the  story  of  the\nRebellion,  and  teach  them  the  tune  of\n'Beasts of England'.<br><br>Most of this\ntime  Mr.  Jones  had  spent  sitting  in  the\ntaproom  of  the<br><br>Red  Lion  at\nWillingdon,  complaining  to  anyone  who\nwould listen of the monstrous injustice he\nhad  suffered  in  being  turned  out  of  his\nproperty  by  a  pack  of  good-for-nothing\nanimals.  The  other  farmers  sympathised\nin  principle,  but  they  did  not  at  first  give\nhim  much  help.  At  heart,  each  of  them\nwas secretly wondering whether he could\nnot  somehow  turn<br><br>Jones's\nmisfortune  to  his  own  advantage.  It  was\nlucky  that  the  owners  of  the  two  farms\nwhich  adjoined  Animal  Farm  were  on\npermanently  bad  terms.  One  of  them,\nwhich was named Foxwood, was a large,\nneglected,  old-fashioned  farm,  much", "overgrown  by  woodland,  with  all  its\npastures  worn  out  and  its  hedges  in  a\ndisgraceful  condition.  Its  owner,  Mr.\nPilkington, was an easy-going gentleman\nfarmer  who  spent  most  of  his  time  in\nfishing  or  hunting  according  to  the\nseason.  The  other  farm,  which  was\ncalled  Pinchfield,  was  smaller  and  better\nkept.<br><br>Its  owner  was  a  Mr.\nFrederick,  a  tough,  shrewd  man,\nperpetually  involved  in  lawsuits  and  with\na  name  for  driving  hard  bargains.  These\ntwo  disliked  each  other  so  much  that  it\nwas  difficult  for  them  to  come  to  any\nagreement, even in defence of their own\ninterests.<br><br>Nevertheless,  they\nwere  both  thoroughly  frightened  by  the\nrebellion  on  Animal  Farm,  and  very\nanxious  to  prevent  their  own  animals\nfrom  learning  too  much  about  it.  At  first\nthey pretended to laugh to scorn the idea\nof  animals  managing  a  farm  for\nthemselves.<br><br>The  whole  thing\nwould  be  over  in  a  fortnight,  they  said.\nThey put it about that the animals on the\nManor  Farm  (they  insisted  on  calling  it\nthe  Manor  Farm;  they  would  not  tolerate", "the  name  \"Animal  Farm\")  were\nperpetually  fighting  among  themselves\nand  were  also  rapidly  starving  to  death.\nWhen  time  passed  and  the  animals  had\nevidently  not  starved  to  death,  Frederick\nand  Pilkington  changed  their  tune  and\nbegan  to  talk  of  the  terrible  wickedness\nthat  now  flourished  on\nAnimal<br><br>Farm.  It  was  given  out\nthat  the  animals  there  practised\ncannibalism,  tortured  one  another  with\nred-hot  horseshoes,  and  had  their\nfemales in common. This was what came\nof  rebelling  against  the  laws  of\nNature,<br><br>Frederick  and  Pilkington\nsaid.<br><br>However,  these  stories\nwere  never  fully  believed.  Rumours  of  a\nwonderful farm, where the human beings\nhad  been  turned  out  and  the  animals\nmanaged  their  own  affairs,  continued  to\ncirculate  in  vague  and  distorted  forms,\nand  throughout  that  year  a  wave  of\nrebelliousness  ran  through  the\ncountryside.  Bulls  which  had  always\nbeen  tractable  suddenly  turned  savage,\nsheep broke down hedges and devoured\nthe  clover,  cows  kicked  the  pail  over,", "hunters  refused  their  fences  and  shot\ntheir  riders  on  to  the  other  side.  Above\nall,  the  tune  and  even  the  words  of\n'Beasts  of  England'  were  known\neverywhere.  It  had  spread  with\nastonishing  speed.  The  human  beings\ncould  not  contain  their  rage  when  they\nheard  this  song,  though  they  pretended\nto  think  it  merely  ridiculous.  They  could\nnot  understand,  they  said,  how  even\nanimals  could  bring  themselves  to  sing\nsuch  contemptible  rubbish.  Any  animal\ncaught singing it was given a flogging on\nthe  spot.  And  yet  the  song  was\nirrepressible. The blackbirds whistled it in\nthe  hedges,  the  pigeons  cooed  it  in  the\nelms,  it  got  into  the  din  of  the  smithies\nand  the  tune  of  the  church  bells.  And\nwhen  the  human  beings  listened  to  it,\nthey  secretly  trembled,  hearing  in  it  a\nprophecy  of  their  future\ndoom.<br><br>Early  in  October,  when\nthe  corn  was  cut  and  stacked  and  some\nof  it  was  already  threshed,  a  flight  of\npigeons  came  whirling  through  the  air\nand  alighted  in  the  yard  of  Animal  Farm\nin  the  wildest  excitement.  Jones  and  all", "his  men,  with  half  a  dozen  others  from\nFoxwood  and<br><br>Pinchfield,  had\nentered  the  five-barred  gate  and  were\ncoming  up  the  cart-track  that  led  to  the\nfarm.  They  were  all  carrying  sticks,\nexcept<br><br>Jones,  who  was\nmarching ahead with a gun in his hands.\nObviously they were going to attempt the\nrecapture  of  the  farm.<br><br>This  had\nlong been expected, and all preparations\nhad  been  made.<br><br>Snowball,  who\nhad  studied  an  old  book  of  Julius\nCaesar's campaigns which he had found\nin  the  farmhouse,  was  in  charge  of  the\ndefensive operations. He gave his orders\nquickly, and in a couple of minutes every\nanimal  was  at  his  post.<br><br>As  the\nhuman  beings  approached  the  farm\nbuildings,  Snowball  launched  his  first\nattack.  All  the  pigeons,  to  the  number  of\nthirty-five, flew to and fro over the men's\nheads  and  muted  upon  them  from  mid-\nair; and while the men were dealing with\nthis,  the  geese,  who  had  been  hiding\nbehind  the  hedge,  rushed  out  and\npecked  viciously  at  the  calves  of  their\nlegs.  However,  this  was  only  a  light", "skirmishing  manoeuvre,  intended  to\ncreate  a  little  disorder,  and  the  men\neasily  drove  the  geese  off  with  their\nsticks.  Snowball  now  launched  his\nsecond  line  of  attack.<br><br>Muriel,\nBenjamin,  and  all  the  sheep,  with\nSnowball  at  the  head  of  them,  rushed\nforward and prodded and butted the men\nfrom  every  side,  while  Benjamin  turned\naround and lashed at them with his small\nhoofs. But once again the men, with their\nsticks  and  their  hobnailed  boots,  were\ntoo  strong  for  them;  and  suddenly,  at  a\nsqueal  from<br><br>Snowball,  which\nwas the signal for retreat, all the animals\nturned and fled through the gateway into\nthe yard.<br><br>The men gave a shout\nof  triumph.  They  saw,  as  they  imagined,\ntheir  enemies  in  flight,  and  they  rushed\nafter them in disorder. This was just what\nSnowball had intended. As soon as they\nwere  well  inside  the  yard,  the  three\nhorses,  the  three  cows,  and  the  rest  of\nthe  pigs,  who  had  been  lying  in  ambush\nin  the  cowshed,  suddenly  emerged  in\ntheir rear, cutting them off. Snowball now\ngave  the  signal  for  the  charge.  He", "himself dashed straight for Jones. Jones\nsaw  him  coming,  raised  his  gun  and\nfired.  The  pellets  scored  bloody  streaks\nalong  Snowball's  back,  and  a  sheep\ndropped  dead.  Without  halting  for  an\ninstant,  Snowball  flung  his  fifteen  stone\nagainst  Jones's  legs.  Jones  was  hurled\ninto a pile of dung and his gun flew out of\nhis  hands.  But  the  most  terrifying\nspectacle of all was Boxer, rearing up on\nhis  hind  legs  and  striking  out  with  his\ngreat  iron-shod  hoofs  like  a  stallion.  His\nvery  first  blow  took  a  stable-lad  from\nFoxwood  on  the  skull  and  stretched  him\nlifeless  in  the  mud.  At  the  sight,  several\nmen  dropped  their  sticks  and  tried  to\nrun.<br><br>Panic  overtook  them,  and\nthe next moment all the animals together\nwere  chasing  them  round  and  round  the\nyard.  They  were  gored,  kicked,  bitten,\ntrampled on. There was not an animal on\nthe  farm  that  did  not  take  vengeance  on\nthem after his own fashion. Even the cat\nsuddenly  leapt  off  a  roof  onto  a\ncowman's shoulders and sank her claws\nin his neck, at which he yelled horribly. At\na  moment  when  the  opening  was  clear,", "the men were glad enough to rush out of\nthe  yard  and  make  a  bolt  for  the  main\nroad.  And  so  within  five  minutes  of  their\ninvasion they were in ignominious retreat\nby the same way as they had come, with\na  flock  of  geese  hissing  after  them  and\npecking  at  their  calves  all  the\nway.<br><br>All  the  men  were  gone\nexcept  one.  Back  in  the  yard  Boxer  was\npawing  with  his  hoof  at  the  stable-lad\nwho  lay  face  down  in  the  mud,  trying  to\nturn him over. The boy did not stir. \"He is\ndead,\"  said  Boxer  sorrowfully.  \"I  had  no\nintention of doing that. I forgot that I was\nwearing iron shoes. Who will believe that\nI  did  not  do  this  on  purpose?\"  \"No\nsentimentality,  comrade!\"  cried  Snowball\nfrom  whose  wounds  the  blood  was  still\ndripping.  \"War  is  war.  The  only  good\nhuman  being  is  a  dead  one.\"  \"I  have  no\nwish  to  take  life,  not  even  human  life,\"\nrepeated Boxer, and his eyes were full of\ntears.  \"Where  is  Mollie?\"  exclaimed\nsomebody.<br><br>Mollie  in  fact  was\nmissing.  For  a  moment  there  was  great\nalarm;  it  was  feared  that  the  men  might\nhave  harmed  her  in  some  way,  or  even", "carried  her  off  with  them.  In  the  end,\nhowever,  she  was  found  hiding  in  her\nstall with her head buried among the hay\nin the manger. She had taken to flight as\nsoon as the gun went off. And when the\nothers came back from looking for her, it\nwas to find that the stable-lad, who in fact\nwas only stunned, had already recovered\nand  made  off.<br><br>The  animals  had\nnow  reassembled  in  the  wildest\nexcitement,  each  recounting  his  own\nexploits  in  the  battle  at  the  top  of  his\nvoice.  An  impromptu  celebration  of  the\nvictory  was  held  immediately.  The  flag\nwas run up and 'Beasts of England' was\nsung  a  number  of  times,  then  the  sheep\nwho had been killed was given a solemn\nfuneral,  a  hawthorn  bush  being  planted\non  her  grave.  At  the  graveside  Snowball\nmade  a  little  speech,  emphasising  the\nneed  for  all  animals  to  be  ready  to  die\nfor<br><br>Animal  Farm  if  need\nbe.<br><br>The  animals  decided\nunanimously  to  create  a  military\ndecoration,  \"Animal  Hero,  First  Class,\"\nwhich  was  conferred  there  and  then\non<br><br>Snowball  and  Boxer.  It", "consisted  of  a  brass  medal  (they  were\nreally some old horse-brasses which had\nbeen  found  in  the  harness-room),  to  be\nworn  on  Sundays  and  holidays.  There\nwas  also  \"Animal  Hero,<br><br>Second\nClass,\"  which  was  conferred\nposthumously  on  the  dead\nsheep.<br><br>There  was  much\ndiscussion  as  to  what  the  battle  should\nbe  called.<br><br>In  the  end,  it  was\nnamed  the  Battle  of  the  Cowshed,  since\nthat  was  where  the  ambush  had  been\nsprung. Mr. Jones's gun had been found\nlying  in  the  mud,  and  it  was  known  that\nthere  was  a  supply  of  cartridges  in  the\nfarmhouse. It was decided to set the gun\nup at the foot of the Flagstaff, like a piece\nof  artillery,  and  to  fire  it  twice  a  year  -\nonce  on  October  the  twelfth,  the\nanniversary  of  the  Battle  of\nthe<br><br>Cowshed,  and  once  on\nMidsummer  Day,  the  anniversary  of\nthe<br><br>Rebellion. ", "#$#$Chapter  5#$#$<br><br>A  s  winter\ndrew  on,  Mollie  became  more  and  more\ntroublesome.<br><br>She  was  late  for\nwork every morning and excused herself\nby  saying  that  she  had  overslept,  and\nshe  complained  of  mysterious  pains,\nalthough  her  appetite  was  excellent.  On\nevery kind of pretext she would run away\nfrom  work  and  go  to  the  drinking  pool,\nwhere  she  would  stand  foolishly  gazing\nat  her  own  reflection  in  the  water.  But\nthere  were  also  rumours  of  something\nmore serious. One day, as Mollie strolled\nblithely  into  the  yard,  flirting  her  long  tail\nand  chewing  at  a  stalk  of  hay,  Clover\ntook her aside. \"Mollie,\" she said, \"I have\nsomething  very  serious  to  say  to\nyou.<br><br>This  morning  I  saw  you\nlooking  over  the  hedge  that  divides\nAnimal<br><br>Farm  from  Foxwood.\nOne of Mr. Pilkington's men was standing\non  the  other  side  of  the  hedge.  And  -  I\nwas  a  long  way  away,  but  I  am  almost\ncertain I saw this - he was talking to you\nand you were allowing him to stroke your\nnose. What does that mean, Mollie?\" \"He\ndidn't! I wasn't! It isn't true!\" cried Mollie,", "beginning  to  prance  about  and  paw  the\nground. \"Mollie! Look me in the face. Do\nyou  give  me  your  word  of  honour  that\nthat man was not stroking your nose?\" \"It\nisn't true!\" repeated Mollie, but she could\nnot look Clover in the face, and the next\nmoment  she  took  to  her  heels  and\ngalloped  away  into  the  field.<br><br>A\nthought  struck  Clover.  Without  saying\nanything  to  the  others,  she  went  to\nMollie's  stall  and  turned  over  the  straw\nwith  her  hoof.<br><br>Hidden  under  the\nstraw  was  a  little  pile  of  lump  sugar  and\nseveral  bunches  of  ribbon  of  different\ncolours.<br><br>Three  days  later  Mollie\ndisappeared.  For  some  weeks  nothing\nwas known of her whereabouts, then the\npigeons  reported  that  they  had  seen  her\non the other side of Willingdon. She was\nbetween  the  shafts  of  a  smart  dogcart\npainted  red  and  black,  which  was\nstanding  outside  a  public-house.  A  fat\nred-faced  man  in  check  breeches  and\ngaiters,  who  looked  like  a  publican,  was\nstroking  her  nose  and  feeding  her  with\nsugar.  Her  coat  was  newly  clipped  and\nshe  wore  a  scarlet  ribbon  round  her", "forelock.  She  appeared  to  be  enjoying\nherself,  so  the  pigeons\nsaid.<br><br>None  of  the  animals  ever\nmentioned  Mollie  again.<br><br>In\nJanuary  there  came  bitterly  hard\nweather.  The  earth  was  like  iron,  and\nnothing could be done in the fields. Many\nmeetings  were  held  in  the  big  barn,  and\nthe  pigs  occupied  themselves  with\nplanning  out  the  work  of  the  coming\nseason. It had come to be accepted that\nthe  pigs,  who  were  manifestly  cleverer\nthan the other animals, should decide all\nquestions  of  farm  policy,  though  their\ndecisions had to be ratified by a majority\nvote.  This  arrangement  would  have\nworked well enough if it had not been for\nthe  disputes  between  Snowball\nand<br><br>Napoleon.  These  two\ndisagreed  at  every  point  where\ndisagreement  was  possible.  If  one  of\nthem suggested sowing a bigger acreage\nwith  barley,  the  other  was  certain  to\ndemand a bigger acreage of oats, and if\none  of  them  said  that  such  and  such  a\nfield  was  just  right  for  cabbages,  the\nother  would  declare  that  it  was  useless", "for  anything  except  roots.  Each  had  his\nown  following,  and  there  were  some\nviolent debates. At the<br><br>Meetings\nSnowball  often  won  over  the  majority  by\nhis  brilliant  speeches,  but  Napoleon  was\nbetter  at  canvassing  support  for  himself\nin  between  times.  He  was  especially\nsuccessful  with  the  sheep.  Of  late  the\nsheep  had  taken  to  bleating  \"Four  legs\ngood,  two  legs  bad\"  both  in  and  out  of\nseason,  and  they  often  interrupted  the\nMeeting with this. It was noticed that they\nwere especially liable to break into \"Four\nlegs  good,  two  legs  bad\"  at  crucial\nmoments  in  Snowball's  speeches.\nSnowball  had  made  a  close  study  of\nsome  back  numbers  of  the  'Farmer\nand<br><br>Stockbreeder' which he had\nfound  in  the  farmhouse,  and  was  full  of\nplans  for  innovations  and  improvements.\nHe  talked  learnedly  about  field  drains,\nsilage,  and  basic  slag,  and  had  worked\nout  a  complicated  scheme  for  all  the\nanimals to drop their dung directly in the\nfields,  at  a  different  spot  every  day,  to\nsave  the  labour  of  cartage.  Napoleon\nproduced  no  schemes  of  his  own,  but", "said  quietly  that  Snowball's  would  come\nto  nothing,  and  seemed  to  be  biding  his\ntime.  But  of  all  their  controversies,  none\nwas  so  bitter  as  the  one  that  took  place\nover  the  windmill.<br><br>In  the  long\npasture,  not  far  from  the  farm  buildings,\nthere  was  a  small  knoll  which  was  the\nhighest point on the farm. After surveying\nthe  ground,  Snowball  declared  that  this\nwas  just  the  place  for  a  windmill,  which\ncould be made to operate a dynamo and\nsupply  the  farm  with  electrical  power.\nThis would light the stalls and warm them\nin  winter,  and  would  also  run  a  circular\nsaw, a chaff-cutter, a mangel- slicer, and\nan electric milking machine. The animals\nhad  never  heard  of  anything  of  this  kind\nbefore (for the farm was an old-fashioned\none  and  had  only  the  most  primitive\nmachinery),  and  they  listened  in\nastonishment while Snowball conjured up\npictures  of  fantastic  machines  which\nwould  do  their  work  for  them  while  they\ngrazed  at  their  ease  in  the  fields  or\nimproved  their  minds  with  reading  and\nconversation.<br><br>Within  a  few\nweeks  Snowball's  plans  for  the  windmill", "were  fully  worked  out.  The  mechanical\ndetails  came  mostly  from  three  books\nwhich  had  belonged  to  Mr.  Jones  -'One\nThousand  Useful  Things  to<br><br>Do\nAbout  the  House',  'Every  Man  His  Own\nBricklayer', and 'Electricity for Beginners'.\nSnowball used as his study a shed which\nhad  once  been  used  for  incubators  and\nhad  a  smooth  wooden  floor,  suitable  for\ndrawing  on.  He  was  closeted  there  for\nhours at a time. With his books held open\nby  a  stone,  and  with  a  piece  of  chalk\ngripped  between  the  knuckles  of  his\ntrotter, he would move rapidly to and fro,\ndrawing in line after line and uttering little\nwhimpers  of  excitement.  Gradually  the\nplans  grew  into  a  complicated  mass  of\ncranks  and  cog-wheels,  covering  more\nthan  half  the  floor,  which  the  other\nanimals  found  completely  unintelligible\nbut very impressive. All of them came to\nlook  at<br><br>Snowball's  drawings  at\nleast  once  a  day.  Even  the  hens  and\nducks  came,  and  were  at  pains  not  to\ntread  on  the  chalk  marks.\nOnly<br><br>Napoleon  held  aloof.  He\nhad declared himself against the windmill", "from  the  start.  One  day,  however,  he\narrived  unexpectedly  to  examine  the\nplans. He walked heavily round the shed,\nlooked closely at every detail of the plans\nand  snuffed  at  them  once  or  twice,  then\nstood for a little while contemplating them\nout  of  the  corner  of  his  eye;  then\nsuddenly  he  lifted  his  leg,  urinated  over\nthe  plans,  and  walked  out  without\nuttering  a  word.<br><br>The  whole  farm\nwas deeply divided on the subject of the\nwindmill.<br><br>Snowball  did  not  deny\nthat  to  build  it  would  be  a  difficult\nbusiness.<br><br>Stone  would  have  to\nbe  carried  and  built  up  into  walls,  then\nthe  sails  would  have  to  be  made  and\nafter  that  there  would  be  need  for\ndynamos and cables. (How these were to\nbe  procured,  Snowball  did  not  say.)  But\nhe maintained that it could all be done in\na  year.  And  thereafter,  he  declared,  so\nmuch  labour  would  be  saved  that  the\nanimals  would  only  need  to  work  three\ndays  a  week.  Napoleon,  on  the  other\nhand,  argued  that  the  great  need  of  the\nmoment was to increase food production,\nand  that  if  they  wasted  time  on  the", "windmill  they  would  all  starve  to  death.\nThe animals formed themselves into two\nfactions  under  the  slogan,  \"Vote  for\nSnowball  and  the  three-day  week\"  and\n\"Vote  for<br><br>Napoleon  and  the  full\nmanger.\"  Benjamin  was  the  only  animal\nwho  did  not  side  with  either  faction.  He\nrefused  to  believe  either  that  food  would\nbecome  more  plentiful  or  that  the\nwindmill  would  save\nwork.<br><br>Windmill or no windmill, he\nsaid,  life  would  go  on  as  it  had  always\ngone  on  -  that  is,  badly.<br><br>Apart\nfrom the disputes over the windmill, there\nwas  the  question  of  the  defence  of  the\nfarm. It was fully realised that though the\nhuman  beings  had  been  defeated  in  the\nBattle  of  the  Cowshed  they  might  make\nanother and more determined attempt to\nrecapture  the  farm  and  reinstate  Mr.\nJones. They had all the more reason for\ndoing  so  because  the  news  of  their\ndefeat had spread across the countryside\nand  made  the  animals  on  the\nneighbouring  farms  more  restive  than\never.  As  usual,  Snowball  and  Napoleon\nwere  in  disagreement.  According", "to<br><br>Napoleon,  what  the  animals\nmust  do  was  to  procure  firearms  and\ntrain  themselves  in  the  use  of  them.\nAccording  to  Snowball,  they  must  send\nout  more  and  more  pigeons  and  stir  up\nrebellion among the animals on the other\nfarms. The one argued that if they could\nnot  defend  themselves  they  were  bound\nto be conquered, the other argued that if\nrebellions  happened  everywhere  they\nwould  have  no  need  to  defend\nthemselves.  The  animals  listened  first  to\nNapoleon,  then  to  Snowball,  and  could\nnot make up their minds which was right;\nindeed, they always found themselves in\nagreement  with  the  one  who  was\nspeaking  at  the  moment.<br><br>At  last\nthe  day  came  when  Snowball's  plans\nwere  completed.  At  the  Meeting  on  the\nfollowing Sunday the question of whether\nor not to begin work on the windmill was\nto  be  put  to  the  vote.  When  the  animals\nhad assembled in the big barn, Snowball\nstood  up  and,  though  occasionally\ninterrupted  by  bleating  from  the  sheep,\nset  forth  his  reasons  for  advocating  the\nbuilding  of  the  windmill.  Then  Napoleon", "stood  up  to  reply.  He  said  very  quietly\nthat  the  windmill  was  nonsense  and  that\nhe  advised  nobody  to  vote  for  it,  and\npromptly sat down again; he had spoken\nfor  barely  thirty  seconds,  and  seemed\nalmost  indifferent  as  to  the  effect  he\nproduced. At this Snowball sprang to his\nfeet,  and  shouting  down  the  sheep,  who\nhad  begun  bleating  again,  broke  into  a\npassionate  appeal  in  favour  of  the\nwindmill. Until now the animals had been\nabout equally divided in their sympathies,\nbut  in  a  moment  Snowball's  eloquence\nhad  carried  them  away.  In  glowing\nsentences he painted a picture of Animal\nFarm  as  it  might  be  when  sordid  labour\nwas  lifted  from  the  animals'  backs.  His\nimagination  had  now  run  far  beyond\nchaff-cutters  and  turnip-slicers.\nElectricity,  he  said,  could  operate\nthreshing  machines,  ploughs,  harrows,\nrollers, and reapers and binders, besides\nsupplying every stall with its own electric\nlight,  hot  and  cold  water,  and  an  electric\nheater.  By  the  time  he  had  finished\nspeaking, there was no doubt as to which\nway  the  vote  would  go.  But  just  at  this", "moment Napoleon stood up and, casting\na  peculiar  sidelong  look  at  Snowball,\nuttered a high-pitched whimper of a kind\nno  one  had  ever  heard  him  utter\nbefore.<br><br>At  this  there  was  a\nterrible  baying  sound  outside,  and  nine\nenormous  dogs  wearing  brass-studded\ncollars  came  bounding  into  the  barn.\nThey  dashed  straight  for  Snowball,  who\nonly sprang from his place just in time to\nescape their snapping jaws. In a moment\nhe  was  out  of  the  door  and  they  were\nafter him. Too amazed and frightened to\nspeak,  all  the  animals  crowded  through\nthe  door  to  watch  the\nchase.<br><br>Snowball  was  racing\nacross  the  long  pasture  that  led  to  the\nroad.  He  was  running  as  only  a  pig  can\nrun,  but  the  dogs  were  close  on  his\nheels.<br><br>Suddenly  he  slipped  and\nit  seemed  certain  that  they  had  him.\nThen  he  was  up  again,  running  faster\nthan ever, then the dogs were gaining on\nhim again. One of them all but closed his\njaws  on  Snowball's  tail,\nbut<br><br>Snowball whisked it free just\nin  time.  Then  he  put  on  an  extra  spurt", "and,  with  a  few  inches  to  spare,  slipped\nthrough  a  hole  in  the  hedge  and  was\nseen  no  more.<br><br>Silent  and\nterrified,  the  animals  crept  back  into  the\nbarn.  In  a  moment  the  dogs  came\nbounding back. At first no one had been\nable  to  imagine  where  these  creatures\ncame  from,  but  the  problem  was  soon\nsolved:  they  were  the  puppies  whom\nNapoleon  had  taken  away  from  their\nmothers and reared privately. Though not\nyet full-grown, they were huge dogs, and\nas  fierce-looking  as  wolves.  They  kept\nclose  to<br><br>Napoleon.  It  was\nnoticed  that  they  wagged  their  tails  to\nhim  in  the  same  way  as  the  other  dogs\nhad  been  used  to  do  to  Mr.\nJones.<br><br>Napoleon,  with  the  dogs\nfollowing  him,  now  mounted  on  to  the\nraised  portion  of  the  floor  where  Major\nhad  previously  stood  to  deliver  his\nspeech. He announced that from now on\nthe  Sunday-morning<br><br>Meetings\nwould  come  to  an  end.  They  were\nunnecessary,  he  said,  and  wasted  time.\nIn  future  all  questions  relating  to  the\nworking of the farm would be settled by a", "special  committee  of  pigs,  presided  over\nby  himself.  These  would  meet  in  private\nand  afterwards  communicate  their\ndecisions  to  the  others.  The  animals\nwould  still  assemble  on<br><br>Sunday\nmornings  to  salute  the  flag,  sing  'Beasts\nof  England',  and  receive  their  orders  for\nthe  week;  but  there  would  be  no  more\ndebates.<br><br>In  spite  of  the  shock\nthat  Snowball's  expulsion  had  given\nthem, the animals were dismayed by this\nannouncement.  Several  of  them  would\nhave  protested  if  they  could  have  found\nthe right arguments. Even<br><br>Boxer\nwas  vaguely  troubled.  He  set  his  ears\nback,  shook  his  forelock  several  times,\nand  tried  hard  to  marshal  his  thoughts;\nbut  in  the  end  he  could  not  think  of\nanything  to  say.  Some  of  the  pigs\nthemselves,  however,  were  more\narticulate. Four young porkers in the front\nrow  uttered  shrill  squeals  of  disapproval,\nand  all  four  of  them  sprang  to  their  feet\nand  began  speaking  at  once.  But\nsuddenly  the  dogs  sitting  round\nNapoleon let out deep, menacing growls,\nand  the  pigs  fell  silent  and  sat  down", "again.  Then  the  sheep  broke  out  into  a\ntremendous  bleating  of  \"Four  legs  good,\ntwo legs bad!\" which went on for nearly a\nquarter of an hour and put an end to any\nchance  of\ndiscussion.<br><br>Afterwards  Squealer\nwas  sent  round  the  farm  to  explain  the\nnew  arrangement  to  the  others.\n\"Comrades,\"  he  said,  \"I  trust  that  every\nanimal here appreciates the sacrifice that\nComrade  Napoleon  has  made  in  taking\nthis  extra  labour  upon  himself.  Do  not\nimagine,  comrades,  that  leadership  is  a\npleasure!  On  the  contrary,  it  is  a  deep\nand  heavy  responsibility.  No  one\nbelieves  more  firmly  than  Comrade\nNapoleon  that  all  animals  are  equal.  He\nwould be only too happy to let you make\nyour  decisions  for  yourselves.  But\nsometimes  you  might  make  the  wrong\ndecisions,  comrades,  and  then  where\nshould we be? Suppose you had decided\nto follow Snowball, with his moonshine of\nwindmills  -  Snowball,  who,  as  we  now\nknow,  was  no  better  than  a  criminal?\"\n\"He  fought  bravely  at  the  Battle  of  the\nCowshed,\"  said  somebody.  \"Bravery  is", "not enough,\" said Squealer. \"Loyalty and\nobedience are more important. And as to\nthe  Battle  of  the  Cowshed,  I  believe  the\ntime  will  come  when  we  shall  find  that\nSnowball's  part  in  it  was  much\nexaggerated.  Discipline,  comrades,  iron\ndiscipline!  That  is  the  watchword  for\ntoday.  One  false  step,  and  our  enemies\nwould be upon us. Surely, comrades, you\ndo  not  want  Jones  back?\"<br><br>Once\nagain  this  argument  was  unanswerable.\nCertainly the animals did not want Jones\nback; if the holding of debates on Sunday\nmornings  was  liable  to  bring  him  back,\nthen  the  debates  must\nstop.<br><br>Boxer,  who  had  now  had\ntime  to  think  things  over,  voiced  the\ngeneral  feeling  by  saying:  \"If  Comrade\nNapoleon  says  it,  it  must  be  right.\"  And\nfrom  then  on  he  adopted  the  maxim,\n\"Napoleon is always right,\" in addition to\nhis  private  motto  of  \"I  will  work\nharder.\"<br><br>By this time the weather\nhad broken and the spring ploughing had\nbegun.  The  shed  where  Snowball  had\ndrawn his plans of the windmill had been\nshut  up  and  it  was  assumed  that  the", "plans  had  been  rubbed  off  the  floor.\nEvery Sunday morning at ten o'clock the\nanimals  assembled  in  the  big  barn  to\nreceive  their  orders  for  the  week.  The\nskull of old Major, now clean of flesh, had\nbeen disinterred from the orchard and set\nup on a stump at the foot of the flagstaff,\nbeside  the  gun.  After  the  hoisting  of  the\nflag,  the  animals  were  required  to  file\npast  the  skull  in  a  reverent  manner\nbefore  entering  the\nbarn.<br><br>Nowadays  they  did  not  sit\nall  together  as  they  had  done  in  the\npast.<br><br>Napoleon,  with  Squealer\nand  another  pig  named  Minimus,  who\nhad  a  remarkable  gift  for  composing\nsongs and poems, sat on the front of the\nraised platform, with the nine young dogs\nforming a semicircle round them, and the\nother  pigs  sitting  behind.  The  rest  of  the\nanimals sat facing them in the main body\nof the barn. Napoleon read out the orders\nfor the week in a gruff soldierly style, and\nafter  a  single  singing  of  'Beasts  of\nEngland',  all  the  animals\ndispersed.<br><br>On  the  third  Sunday\nafter  Snowball's  expulsion,  the  animals", "were  somewhat  surprised  to  hear\nNapoleon  announce  that  the  windmill\nwas  to  be  built  after  all.  He  did  not  give\nany reason for having changed his mind,\nbut  merely  warned  the  animals  that  this\nextra task would mean very hard work, it\nmight even be necessary to reduce their\nrations. The plans, however, had all been\nprepared,  down  to  the  last  detail.  A\nspecial  committee  of  pigs  had  been  at\nwork upon them for the past three weeks.\nThe building of the windmill, with various\nother  improvements,  was  expected  to\ntake  two  years.<br><br>That  evening\nSquealer explained privately to the other\nanimals  that  Napoleon  had  never  in\nreality been opposed to the windmill. On\nthe  contrary,  it  was  he  who  had\nadvocated  it  in  the  beginning,  and  the\nplan  which  Snowball  had  drawn  on  the\nfloor  of  the  incubator  shed  had  actually\nbeen  stolen  from  among  Napoleon's\npapers.  The  windmill  was,  in  fact,\nNapoleon's  own  creation.  Why,  then,\nasked  somebody,  had  he  spoken  so\nstrongly against it? Here Squealer looked\nvery  sly.  That,  he  said,  was  Comrade", "Napoleon's cunning. He had SEEMED to\noppose  the  windmill,  simply  as  a\nmanoeuvre  to  get  rid  of  Snowball,  who\nwas  a  dangerous  character  and  a  bad\ninfluence.  Now  that  Snowball  was  out  of\nthe  way,  the  plan  could  go  forward\nwithout  his  interference.  This,  said\nSquealer,  was  something  called  tactics.\nHe repeated a number of times, \"Tactics,\ncomrades,  tactics!\"  skipping  round  and\nwhisking his tail with a merry laugh. The\nanimals  were  not  certain  what  the  word\nmeant,  but  Squealer  spoke  so\npersuasively,  and  the  three  dogs  who\nhappened  to  be  with  him  growled  so\nthreateningly,  that  they  accepted  his\nexplanation without further questions.  ", "#$#$Chapter  6#$#$<br><br>A  ll  that\nyear the animals worked like slaves. But\nthey  were  happy  in  their  work;  they\ngrudged no effort or sacrifice, well aware\nthat  everything  that  they  did  was  for  the\nbenefit  of  themselves  and  those  of  their\nkind who would come after them, and not\nfor  a  pack  of  idle,  thieving  human\nbeings.<br><br>Throughout  the  spring\nand  summer  they  worked  a  sixty-hour\nweek,  and  in  August  Napoleon\nannounced  that  there  would  be  work\non<br><br>Sunday  afternoons  as  well.\nThis  work  was  strictly  voluntary,  but  any\nanimal  who  absented  himself  from  it\nwould  have  his  rations  reduced  by  half.\nEven so, it was found necessary to leave\ncertain  tasks  undone.<br><br>The\nharvest  was  a  little  less  successful  than\nin the previous year, and two fields which\nshould have been sown with roots in the\nearly  summer  were  not  sown  because\nthe  ploughing  had  not  been  completed\nearly  enough.  It  was  possible  to  foresee\nthat  the  coming  winter  would  be  a  hard\none.<br><br>The  windmill  presented\nunexpected  difficulties.  There  was  a", "good  quarry  of  limestone  on  the  farm,\nand plenty of sand and cement had been\nfound in one of the outhouses, so that all\nthe  materials  for  building  were  at  hand.\nBut the problem the animals could not at\nfirst solve was how to break up the stone\ninto  pieces  of  suitable  size.  There\nseemed no way of doing this except with\npicks  and  crowbars,  which  no  animal\ncould  use,  because  no  animal  could\nstand on his hind legs. Only after weeks\nof  vain  effort  did  the  right  idea  occur  to\nsomebody-namely,  to  utilise  the  force  of\ngravity.  Huge  boulders,  far  too  big  to  be\nused as they were, were lying all over the\nbed  of  the  quarry.  The  animals  lashed\nropes round these, and then all together,\ncows,  horses,  sheep,  any  animal  that\ncould lay hold of the rope - even the pigs\nsometimes joined in at critical moments -\nthey  dragged  them  with  desperate\nslowness  up  the  slope  to  the  top  of  the\nquarry, where they were toppled over the\nedge,  to  shatter  to  pieces  below.\nTransporting the stone when it was once\nbroken  was  comparatively  simple.  The\nhorses  carried  it  off  in  cart-loads,  the", "sheep  dragged  single  blocks,  even\nMuriel  and<br><br>Benjamin  yoked\nthemselves  into  an  old  governess-cart\nand  did  their  share.  By  late  summer  a\nsufficient  store  of  stone  had\naccumulated,  and  then  the  building\nbegan, under the superintendence of the\npigs.<br><br>But it was a slow, laborious\nprocess.  Frequently  it  took  a  whole  day\nof  exhausting  effort  to  drag  a  single\nboulder  to  the  top  of  the  quarry,  and\nsometimes when it was pushed over the\nedge  it  failed  to  break.  Nothing  could\nhave  been  achieved  without  Boxer,\nwhose  strength  seemed  equal  to  that  of\nall  the  rest  of  the  animals  put  together.\nWhen  the  boulder  began  to  slip  and  the\nanimals  cried  out  in  despair  at  finding\nthemselves dragged down the hill, it was\nalways<br><br>Boxer  who  strained\nhimself against the rope and brought the\nboulder  to  a  stop.  To  see  him  toiling  up\nthe slope inch by inch, his breath coming\nfast,  the  tips  of  his  hoofs  clawing  at  the\nground,  and  his  great  sides  matted  with\nsweat,  filled  everyone  with  admiration.\nClover  warned  him  sometimes  to  be", "careful  not  to  overstrain  himself,\nbut<br><br>Boxer  would  never  listen  to\nher. His two slogans, \"I will work harder\"\nand  \"Napoleon  is  always  right,\"  seemed\nto him a sufficient answer to all problems.\nHe  had  made  arrangements  with  the\ncockerel  to  call  him  three-quarters  of  an\nhour  earlier  in  the  mornings  instead  of\nhalf an hour. And in his spare moments,\nof which there were not many nowadays,\nhe would go alone to the quarry, collect a\nload of broken stone, and drag it down to\nthe  site  of  the  windmill\nunassisted.<br><br>The  animals  were\nnot  badly  off  throughout  that  summer,  in\nspite of the hardness of their work. If they\nhad  no  more  food  than  they  had  had  in\nJones's  day,  at  least  they  did  not  have\nless.  The  advantage  of  only  having  to\nfeed  themselves,  and  not  having  to\nsupport  five  extravagant  human  beings\nas  well,  was  so  great  that  it  would  have\ntaken a lot of failures to outweigh it. And\nin  many  ways  the  animal  method  of\ndoing  things  was  more  efficient  and\nsaved  labour.  Such  jobs  as  weeding,  for\ninstance,  could  be  done  with  a", "thoroughness  impossible  to  human\nbeings.  And  again,  since  no  animal  now\nstole,  it  was  unnecessary  to  fence  off\npasture  from  arable  land,  which  saved  a\nlot  of  labour  on  the  upkeep  of  hedges\nand gates. Nevertheless, as the summer\nwore  on,  various  unforeseen  shortages\nbegan  to  make  them  selves  felt.  There\nwas need of paraffin oil, nails, string, dog\nbiscuits,  and  iron  for  the  horses'  shoes,\nnone of which could be produced on the\nfarm. Later there would also be need for\nseeds  and  artificial  manures,  besides\nvarious  tools  and,  finally,  the  machinery\nfor  the  windmill.  How  these  were  to  be\nprocured,  no  one  was  able  to\nimagine.<br><br>One  Sunday  morning,\nwhen  the  animals  assembled  to  receive\ntheir  orders,  Napoleon  announced  that\nhe had decided upon a new policy. From\nnow onwards Animal Farm would engage\nin trade with the neighbouring farms: not,\nof  course,  for  any  commercial  purpose,\nbut  simply  in  order  to  obtain  certain\nmaterials which were urgently necessary.\nThe  needs  of  the  windmill  must  override\neverything  else,  he  said.  He  was", "therefore  making  arrangements  to  sell  a\nstack of hay and part of the current year's\nwheat  crop,  and  later  on,  if  more  money\nwere  needed,  it  would  have  to  be  made\nup  by  the  sale  of  eggs,  for  which  there\nwas  always  a  market  in  Willingdon.  The\nhens,  said  Napoleon,  should  welcome\nthis  sacrifice  as  their  own  special\ncontribution  towards  the  building  of  the\nwindmill.<br><br>Once  again  the\nanimals  were  conscious  of  a  vague\nuneasiness.<br><br>Never  to  have  any\ndealings  with  human  beings,  never  to\nengage  in  trade,  never  to  make  use  of\nmoney  -  had  not  these  been  among  the\nearliest  resolutions  passed  at  that  first\ntriumphant  Meeting  after  Jones  was\nexpelled?  All  the  animals  remembered\npassing such resolutions: or at least they\nthought  that  they  remembered  it.  The\nfour young pigs who had protested when\nNapoleon  abolished  the  Meetings  raised\ntheir  voices  timidly,  but  they  were\npromptly  silenced  by  a  tremendous\ngrowling  from  the  dogs.  Then,  as  usual,\nthe  sheep  broke  into  \"Four  legs  good,\ntwo  legs  bad!\"  and  the  momentary", "awkwardness  was  smoothed  over.\nFinally  Napoleon  raised  his  trotter  for\nsilence  and  announced  that  he  had\nalready  made  all  the  arrangements.\nThere  would  be  no  need  for  any  of  the\nanimals  to  come  in  contact  with  human\nbeings,  which  would  clearly  be  most\nundesirable.  He  intended  to  take  the\nwhole burden upon his own shoulders. A\nMr.  Whymper,  a  solicitor  living  in\nWillingdon,  had  agreed  to  act  as\nintermediary  between<br><br>Animal\nFarm  and  the  outside  world,  and  would\nvisit  the  farm  every<br><br>Monday\nmorning  to  receive  his  instructions.\nNapoleon  ended  his  speech  with  his\nusual cry of \"Long live Animal Farm!\" and\nafter  the  singing  of  'Beasts  of  England'\nthe  animals  were\ndismissed.<br><br>Afterwards  Squealer\nmade  a  round  of  the  farm  and  set  the\nanimals' minds at rest. He assured them\nthat  the  resolution  against  engaging  in\ntrade  and  using  money  had  never  been\npassed,  or  even  suggested.  It  was  pure\nimagination,  probably  traceable  in  the\nbeginning  to  lies  circulated  by  Snowball.", "A few animals still felt faintly doubtful, but\nSquealer asked them shrewdly, \"Are you\ncertain that this is not something that you\nhave dreamed, comrades? Have you any\nrecord  of  such  a  resolution?  Is  it  written\ndown  anywhere?\"  And  since  it  was\ncertainly  true  that  nothing  of  the  kind\nexisted  in  writing,  the  animals  were\nsatisfied  that  they  had  been\nmistaken.<br><br>Every  Monday  Mr.\nWhymper  visited  the  farm  as  had  been\narranged. He was a sly-looking little man\nwith  side  whiskers,  a  solicitor  in  a  very\nsmall way of business, but sharp enough\nto have realised earlier than anyone else\nthat  Animal  Farm  would  need  a  broker\nand that the commissions would be worth\nhaving. The animals watched his coming\nand  going  with  a  kind  of  dread,  and\navoided  him  as  much  as  possible.\nNevertheless,  the  sight  of  Napoleon,  on\nall  fours,  delivering  orders  to  Whymper,\nwho stood on two legs, roused their pride\nand  partly  reconciled  them  to  the  new\narrangement.  Their  relations  with  the\nhuman race were now not quite the same\nas  they  had  been  before.<br><br>The", "human  beings  did  not  hate  Animal  Farm\nany  less  now  that  it  was  prospering;\nindeed,  they  hated  it  more  than  ever.\nEvery human being held it as an article of\nfaith  that  the  farm  would  go  bankrupt\nsooner  or  later,  and,  above  all,  that  the\nwindmill  would  be  a  failure.  They  would\nmeet  in  the  public-houses  and  prove  to\none  another  by  means  of  diagrams  that\nthe  windmill  was  bound  to  fall  down,  or\nthat  if  it  did  stand  up,  then  that  it  would\nnever  work.  And  yet,  against  their  will,\nthey had developed a certain respect for\nthe  efficiency  with  which  the  animals\nwere  managing  their  own  affairs.  One\nsymptom of this was that they had begun\nto  call  Animal  Farm  by  its  proper  name\nand  ceased  to  pretend  that  it  was  called\nthe Manor Farm. They had also dropped\ntheir  championship  of  Jones,  who  had\ngiven  up  hope  of  getting  his  farm  back\nand  gone  to  live  in  another  part  of  the\ncounty.<br><br>Except  through\nWhymper,  there  was  as  yet  no  contact\nbetween  Animal<br><br>Farm  and  the\noutside  world,  but  there  were  constant\nrumours  that<br><br>Napoleon  was", "about  to  enter  into  a  definite  business\nagreement  either  with  Mr.  Pilkington  of\nFoxwood  or  with  Mr.  Frederick  of\nPinchfield - but never, it was noticed, with\nboth  simultaneously.<br><br>It  was\nabout  this  time  that  the  pigs  suddenly\nmoved  into  the  farmhouse  and  took  up\ntheir  residence  there.  Again  the  animals\nseemed  to  remember  that  a  resolution\nagainst this had been passed in the early\ndays,  and  again  Squealer  was  able  to\nconvince them that this was not the case.\nIt was absolutely necessary, he said, that\nthe pigs, who were the brains of the farm,\nshould  have  a  quiet  place  to  work\nin.<br><br>It was also more suited to the\ndignity  of  the  Leader  (for  of  late  he  had\ntaken to speaking of Napoleon under the\ntitle of \"Leader\") to live in a house than in\na  mere  sty.  Nevertheless,  some  of  the\nanimals were disturbed when they heard\nthat the pigs not only took their meals in\nthe  kitchen  and  used  the  drawing-room\nas a recreation room, but also slept in the\nbeds.  Boxer  passed  it  off  as  usual  with\n\"Napoleon  is  always  right!\",  but  Clover,\nwho  thought  she  remembered  a  definite", "ruling  against  beds,  went  to  the  end  of\nthe  barn  and  tried  to  puzzle  out\nthe<br><br>Seven  Commandments\nwhich  were  inscribed  there.  Finding\nherself  unable  to  read  more  than\nindividual  letters,  she  fetched  Muriel.\n\"Muriel,\"  she  said,  \"read  me  the  Fourth\nCommandment.  Does  it  not  say\nsomething  about  never  sleeping  in  a\nbed?\"<br><br>With some difficulty Muriel\nspelt  it  out.  \"It  says,  'No  animal  shall\nsleep  in  a  bed  with  sheets,\"'  she\nannounced  finally.<br><br>Curiously\nenough, Clover had not remembered that\nthe  Fourth<br><br>Commandment\nmentioned sheets; but as it was there on\nthe  wall,  it  must  have  done  so.  And\nSquealer,  who  happened  to  be  passing\nat this moment, attended by two or three\ndogs, was able to put the whole matter in\nits  proper  perspective.  \"You  have  heard\nthen,  comrades,\"  he  said,  \"that  we  pigs\nnow sleep in the beds of the farmhouse?\nAnd  why  not?  You  did  not  suppose,\nsurely,  that  there  was  ever  a  ruling\nagainst  beds?  A  bed  merely  means  a\nplace to sleep in. A pile of straw in a stall", "is a bed, properly regarded.<br><br>The\nrule  was  against  sheets,  which  are  a\nhuman  invention.  We  have  removed  the\nsheets  from  the  farmhouse  beds,  and\nsleep  between  blankets.  And  very\ncomfortable  beds  they  are  too!  But  not\nmore comfortable than we need, I can tell\nyou, comrades, with all the brainwork we\nhave to do nowadays. You would not rob\nus of our repose, would you, comrades?\nYou would not have us too tired to carry\nout  our  duties?  Surely  none  of  you\nwishes to see Jones back?\"<br><br>The\nanimals  reassured  him  on  this  point\nimmediately,  and  no  more  was  said\nabout the pigs sleeping in the farmhouse\nbeds.  And  when,  some  days  afterwards,\nit  was  announced  that  from  now  on  the\npigs  would  get  up  an  hour  later  in  the\nmornings  than  the  other  animals,  no\ncomplaint was made about that either. By\nthe  autumn  the  animals  were  tired  but\nhappy.  They  had  had  a  hard  year,  and\nafter the sale of part of the hay and corn,\nthe  stores  of  food  for  the  winter  were\nnone  too  plentiful,  but  the  windmill\ncompensated  for  everything.  It  was", "almost  half  built  now.  After  the  harvest\nthere was a stretch of clear dry weather,\nand  the  animals  toiled  harder  than  ever,\nthinking it well worth while to plod to and\nfro all day with blocks of stone if by doing\nso  they  could  raise  the  walls  another\nfoot.  Boxer  would  even  come  out  at\nnights and work for an hour or two on his\nown  by  the  light  of  the  harvest  moon.  In\ntheir  spare  moments  the  animals  would\nwalk  round  and  round  the  half-finished\nmill,  admiring  the  strength  and\nperpendicularity  of  its  walls  and\nmarvelling  that  they  should  ever  have\nbeen  able  to  build  anything  so\nimposing.<br><br>Only  old  Benjamin\nrefused  to  grow  enthusiastic  about  the\nwindmill, though, as usual, he would utter\nnothing  beyond  the  cryptic  remark  that\ndonkeys  live  a  long\ntime.<br><br>November  came,  with\nraging south-west winds. Building had to\nstop  because  it  was  now  too  wet  to  mix\nthe  cement.  Finally  there  came  a  night\nwhen  the  gale  was  so  violent  that  the\nfarm  buildings  rocked  on  their\nfoundations and several tiles were blown", "off  the  roof  of  the  barn.<br><br>The\nhens  woke  up  squawking  with  terror\nbecause  they  had  all  dreamed\nsimultaneously of hearing a gun go off in\nthe  distance.  In  the  morning  the  animals\ncame  out  of  their  stalls  to  find  that  the\nflagstaff  had  been  blown  down  and  an\nelm  tree  at  the  foot  of  the  orchard  had\nbeen plucked up like a radish. They had\njust  noticed  this  when  a  cry  of  despair\nbroke  from  every  animal's  throat.  A\nterrible  sight  had  met  their  eyes.  The\nwindmill  was  in  ruins.<br><br>With  one\naccord  they  dashed  down  to  the  spot.\nNapoleon,  who  seldom  moved  out  of  a\nwalk, raced ahead of them all. Yes, there\nit  lay,  the  fruit  of  all  their  struggles,\nlevelled  to  its  foundations,  the  stones\nthey  had  broken  and  carried  so\nlaboriously  scattered  all\naround.<br><br>Unable at first to speak,\nthey  stood  gazing  mournfully  at  the  litter\nof  fallen  stone.  Napoleon  paced  to  and\nfro in silence, occasionally snuffing at the\nground.  His  tail  had  grown  rigid  and\ntwitched sharply from side to side, a sign\nin  him  of  intense  mental  activity.", "Suddenly  he  halted  as  though  his  mind\nwere  made  up.  \"Comrades,\"  he  said\nquietly, \"do you know who is responsible\nfor  this?  Do  you  know  the  enemy  who\nhas  come  in  the  night  and  overthrown\nour windmill? SNOWBALL!\" he suddenly\nroared  in  a  voice  of  thunder.  \"Snowball\nhas  done  this  thing!  In  sheer  malignity,\nthinking  to  set  back  our  plans  and\navenge  himself  for  his  ignominious\nexpulsion,  this  traitor  has  crept  here\nunder  cover  of  night  and  destroyed  our\nwork  of  nearly  a  year.  Comrades,  here\nand now I pronounce the death sentence\nupon  Snowball.  'Animal  Hero,\nSecond<br><br>Class,' and half a bushel\nof  apples  to  any  animal  who  brings  him\nto  justice.  A  full  bushel  to  anyone  who\ncaptures him alive!\"<br><br>The animals\nwere  shocked  beyond  measure  to  learn\nthat  even<br><br>Snowball  could  be\nguilty of such an action. There was a cry\nof  indignation,  and  everyone  began\nthinking  out  ways  of\ncatching<br><br>Snowball  if  he  should\never come back. Almost immediately the\nfootprints of a pig were discovered in the", "grass  at  a  little  distance  from  the  knoll.\nThey  could  only  be  traced  for  a  few\nyards,  but  appeared  to  lead  to  a  hole  in\nthe  hedge.  Napoleon  snuffed  deeply  at\nthem  and  pronounced  them  to  be\nSnowball's.  He  gave  it  as  his  opinion\nthat<br><br>Snowball  had  probably\ncome  from  the  direction  of  Foxwood\nFarm. \"No more delays, comrades!\" cried\nNapoleon  when  the  footprints  had  been\nexamined.  \"There  is  work  to  be  done.\nThis  very  morning  we  begin  rebuilding\nthe windmill, and we will build all through\nthe  winter,  rain  or  shine.  We  will  teach\nthis miserable traitor that he cannot undo\nour  work  so  easily.  Remember,\ncomrades, there must be no alteration in\nour plans: they shall be carried out to the\nday.  Forward,  comrades!<br><br>Long\nlive the windmill! Long live Animal Farm!\"", "#$#$Chapter  7#$#$<br><br>I  t  was  a\nbitter  winter.  The  stormy  weather  was\nfollowed by sleet and snow, and then by\na  hard  frost  which  did  not  break  till  well\ninto February. The animals carried on as\nbest they could with the rebuilding of the\nwindmill,  well  knowing  that  the  outside\nworld  was  watching  them  and  that  the\nenvious human beings would rejoice and\ntriumph  if  the  mill  were  not  finished  on\ntime.<br><br>Out  of  spite,  the  human\nbeings  pretended  not  to  believe  that  it\nwas<br><br>Snowball  who  had\ndestroyer  the  windmill:  they  said  that  it\nhad  fallen  down  because  the  walls  were\ntoo thin. The animals knew that this was\nnot the case. Still, it had been decided to\nbuild  the  walls  three  feet  thick  this  time\ninstead  of  eighteen  inches  as  before,\nwhich  meant  collecting  much  larger\nquantities  of  stone.  For  a  long  time  the\nquarry was full of snowdrifts and nothing\ncould  be  done.  Some  progress  was\nmade  in  the  dry  frosty  weather  that\nfollowed,  but  it  was  cruel  work,  and  the\nanimals could not feel so hopeful about it\nas  they  had  felt  before.  They  were", "always  cold,  and  usually  hungry  as  well.\nOnly  Boxer  and  Clover  never  lost  heart.\nSquealer  made  excellent  speeches  on\nthe  joy  of  service  and  the  dignity  of\nlabour, but the other animals found more\ninspiration  in<br><br>Boxer's  strength\nand  his  never-failing  cry  of  \"I  will  work\nharder!\"<br><br>In  January  food  fell\nshort.  The  corn  ration  was  drastically\nreduced,  and  it  was  announced  that  an\nextra  potato  ration  would  be  issued  to\nmake  up  for  it.  Then  it  was  discovered\nthat  the  greater  part  of  the  potato  crop\nhad  been  frosted  in  the  clamps,  which\nhad  not  been  covered  thickly  enough.\nThe  potatoes  had  become  soft  and\ndiscoloured, and only a few were edible.\nFor  days  at  a  time  the  animals  had\nnothing  to  eat  but  chaff  and  mangels.\nStarvation  seemed  to  stare  them  in  the\nface.<br><br>It  was  vitally  necessary  to\nconceal  this  fact  from  the  outside  world.\nEmboldened  by  the  collapse  of  the\nwindmill,  the  human  beings  were\ninventing  fresh  lies  about  Animal  Farm.\nOnce again it was being put about that all\nthe  animals  were  dying  of  famine  and", "disease,  and  that  they  were  continually\nfighting  among  themselves  and  had\nresorted  to  cannibalism  and  infanticide.\nNapoleon  was  well  aware  of  the  bad\nresults that might follow if the real facts of\nthe  food  situation  were  known,  and  he\ndecided to make use of Mr. Whymper to\nspread  a  contrary  impression.  Hitherto\nthe  animals  had  had  little  or  no  contact\nwith Whymper on his weekly visits: now,\nhowever, a few selected animals, mostly\nsheep,  were  instructed  to  remark\ncasually  in  his  hearing  that  rations  had\nbeen  increased.  In  addition,  Napoleon\nordered  the  almost  empty  bins  in  the\nstore-shed  to  be  filled  nearly  to  the  brim\nwith  sand,  which  was  then  covered  up\nwith  what  remained  of  the  grain  and\nmeal.  On  some  suitable  pretext\nWhymper was led through the store-shed\nand  allowed  to  catch  a  glimpse  of  the\nbins. He was deceived, and continued to\nreport to the outside world that there was\nno  food  shortage  on  Animal\nFarm.<br><br>Nevertheless, towards the\nend of January it became obvious that it\nwould  be  necessary  to  procure  some", "more  grain  from  somewhere.  In  these\ndays Napoleon rarely appeared in public,\nbut  spent  all  his  time  in  the  farmhouse,\nwhich  was  guarded  at  each  door  by\nfierce-looking  dogs.<br><br>When  he\ndid  emerge,  it  was  in  a  ceremonial\nmanner,  with  an  escort  of  six  dogs  who\nclosely  surrounded  him  and  growled  if\nanyone came too near. Frequently he did\nnot  even  appear  on  Sunday  mornings,\nbut  issued  his  orders  through  one  of  the\nother  pigs,  usually\nSquealer.<br><br>One  Sunday  morning\nSquealer  announced  that  the  hens,  who\nhad  just  come  in  to  lay  again,  must\nsurrender  their  eggs.  Napoleon  had\naccepted,  through  Whymper,  a  contract\nfor  four  hundred  eggs  a\nweek.<br><br>The  price  of  these  would\npay  for  enough  grain  and  meal  to  keep\nthe  farm  going  till  summer  came  on  and\nconditions  were  easier.<br><br>When\nthe hens heard this, they raised a terrible\noutcry.  They  had  been  warned  earlier\nthat this sacrifice might be necessary, but\nhad  not  believed  that  it  would  really\nhappen.  They  were  just  getting  their", "clutches  ready  for  the  spring  sitting,  and\nthey protested that to take the eggs away\nnow was murder. For the first time since\nthe  expulsion  of<br><br>Jones,  there\nwas  something  resembling  a  rebellion.\nLed  by  three  young<br><br>Black\nMinorca  pullets,  the  hens  made  a\ndetermined  effort  to\nthwart<br><br>Napoleon's  wishes.  Their\nmethod  was  to  fly  up  to  the  rafters  and\nthere  lay  their  eggs,  which  smashed  to\npieces  on  the  floor.  Napoleon  acted\nswiftly  and  ruthlessly.  He  ordered  the\nhens' rations to be stopped, and decreed\nthat  any  animal  giving  so  much  as  a\ngrain  of  corn  to  a  hen  should  be\npunished  by  death.  The  dogs  saw  to  it\nthat  these  orders  were  carried  out.  For\nfive  days  the  hens  held  out,  then  they\ncapitulated  and  went  back  to  their\nnesting boxes. Nine hens had died in the\nmeantime.<br><br>Their  bodies  were\nburied  in  the  orchard,  and  it  was  given\nout  that  they  had  died  of  coccidiosis.\nWhymper heard nothing of this affair, and\nthe  eggs  were  duly  delivered,  a  grocer's\nvan driving up to the farm once a week to", "take them away.<br><br>All this while no\nmore  had  been  seen  of  Snowball.  He\nwas rumoured to be hiding on one of the\nneighbouring  farms,\neither<br><br>Foxwood  or  Pinchfield.\nNapoleon  was  by  this  time  on  slightly\nbetter  terms  with  the  other  farmers  than\nbefore. It happened that there was in the\nyard  a  pile  of  timber  which  had  been\nstacked  there  ten  years  earlier  when  a\nbeech  spinney  was  cleared.  It  was  well\nseasoned,  and<br><br>Whymper  had\nadvised  Napoleon  to  sell  it;  both  Mr.\nPilkington  and  Mr.<br><br>Frederick\nwere  anxious  to  buy  it.  Napoleon  was\nhesitating  between  the  two,  unable  to\nmake  up  his  mind.  It  was  noticed  that\nwhenever  he  seemed  on  the  point  of\ncoming  to  an  agreement  with\nFrederick,<br><br>Snowball  was\ndeclared  to  be  in  hiding  at  Foxwood,\nwhile,  when  he  inclined  toward\nPilkington,  Snowball  was  said  to  be  at\nPinchfield.<br><br>Suddenly, early in the\nspring,  an  alarming  thing  was\ndiscovered.<br><br>Snowball  was\nsecretly  frequenting  the  farm  by  night!", "The  animals  were  so  disturbed  that  they\ncould  hardly  sleep  in  their  stalls.  Every\nnight,  it  was  said,  he  came  creeping  in\nunder  cover  of  darkness  and  performed\nall  kinds  of  mischief.  He  stole  the  corn,\nhe  upset  the  milk-pails,  he  broke  the\neggs,  he  trampled  the  seedbeds,  he\ngnawed  the  bark  off  the  fruit  trees.\nWhenever  anything  went  wrong  it\nbecame  usual  to  attribute  it  to  Snowball.\nIf  a  window  was  broken  or  a  drain  was\nblocked up, someone was certain to say\nthat Snowball had come in the night and\ndone  it,  and  when  the  key  of  the\nstore-shed was lost, the whole farm was\nconvinced  that  Snowball  had  thrown  it\ndown  the  well.  Curiously  enough,  they\nwent  on  believing  this  even  after  the\nmislaid  key  was  found  under  a  sack  of\nmeal.  The  cows  declared  unanimously\nthat<br><br>Snowball  crept  into  their\nstalls and milked them in their sleep. The\nrats,  which  had  been  troublesome  that\nwinter,  were  also  said  to  be  in  league\nwith  Snowball.<br><br>Napoleon\ndecreed  that  there  should  be  a  full\ninvestigation  into<br><br>Snowball's", "activities. With his dogs in attendance he\nset  out  and  made  a  careful  tour  of\ninspection of the farm buildings, the other\nanimals  following  at  a  respectful\ndistance.  At  every  few  steps  Napoleon\nstopped  and  snuffed  the  ground  for\ntraces of Snowball's footsteps, which, he\nsaid,  he  could  detect  by  the  smell.  He\nsnuffed  in  every  corner,  in  the  barn,  in\nthe  cow-shed,  in  the  henhouses,  in  the\nvegetable  garden,  and  found  traces  of\nSnowball  almost  everywhere.  He  would\nput his snout to the ground, give several\ndeep sniffs, ad exclaim in a terrible voice,\n\"Snowball! He has been here! I can smell\nhim  distinctly!\"  and  at  the  word\n\"Snowball\"  all  the  dogs  let  out\nblood-curdling  growls  and  showed  their\nside  teeth.<br><br>The  animals  were\nthoroughly frightened. It seemed to them\nas  though  Snowball  were  some  kind  of\ninvisible  influence,  pervading  the  air\nabout  them  and  menacing  them  with  all\nkinds  of  dangers.  In  the  evening\nSquealer  called  them  together,  and  with\nan  alarmed  expression  on  his  face  told\nthem  that  he  had  some  serious  news  to", "report.  \"Comrades!\"  cried  Squealer,\nmaking  little  nervous  skips,  \"a  most\nterrible  thing  has  been  discovered.\nSnowball  has  sold  himself\nto<br><br>Frederick  of  Pinchfield  Farm,\nwho is even now plotting to attack us and\ntake our farm away from us! Snowball is\nto  act  as  his  guide  when  the  attack\nbegins. But there is worse than that. We\nhad  thought  that<br><br>Snowball's\nrebellion was caused simply by his vanity\nand  ambition.  But  we  were  wrong,\ncomrades.  Do  you  know  what  the  real\nreason  was?<br><br>Snowball  was  in\nleague with Jones from the very start! He\nwas  Jones's  secret  agent  all  the  time.  It\nhas all been proved by documents which\nhe  left  behind  him  and  which  we  have\nonly  just  discovered.  To  my  mind  this\nexplains a great deal, comrades. Did we\nnot see for ourselves how he attempted -\nfortunately  without  success  -  to  get  us\ndefeated  and  destroyed  at  the  Battle  of\nthe  Cowshed?\"<br><br>The  animals\nwere  stupefied.  This  was  a  wickedness\nfar  outdoing<br><br>Snowball's\ndestruction  of  the  windmill.  But  it  was", "some  minutes  before  they  could  fully\ntake  it  in.  They  all  remembered,  or\nthought they remembered, how they had\nseen  Snowball  charging  ahead  of  them\nat the Battle of the Cowshed, how he had\nrallied  and  encouraged  them  at  every\nturn,  and  how  he  had  not  paused  for  an\ninstant  even  when  the  pellets  from\nJones's  gun  had  wounded  his  back.  At\nfirst it was a little difficult to see how this\nfitted  in  with  his  being  on  Jones's  side.\nEven<br><br>Boxer,  who  seldom  asked\nquestions,  was  puzzled.  He  lay  down,\ntucked  his  fore  hoofs  beneath  him,  shut\nhis eyes, and with a hard effort managed\nto  formulate  his  thoughts.  \"I  do  not\nbelieve  that,\"  he  said.  \"Snowball  fought\nbravely  at  the<br><br>Battle  of  the\nCowshed.  I  saw  him  myself.  Did  we  not\ngive  him  'Animal<br><br>Hero,  first\nClass,'  immediately  afterwards?\"  \"That\nwas our mistake, comrade. For we know\nnow  -  it  is  all  written  down  in  the  secret\ndocuments  that  we  have  found  -  that  in\nreality  he  was  trying  to  lure  us  to  our\ndoom.\"  \"But  he  was  wounded,\"  said\nBoxer.  \"We  all  saw  him  running  with", "blood.\"  \"That  was  part  of  the\narrangement!\"  cried  Squealer.  \"Jones's\nshot  only  grazed  him.  I  could  show  you\nthis in his own writing, if you were able to\nread it. The plot was for Snowball, at the\ncritical  moment,  to  give  the  signal  for\nflight  and  leave  the  field  to  the  enemy.\nAnd  he  very  nearly  succeeded  -  I  will\neven  say,  comrades,  he  WOULD  have\nsucceeded  if  it  had  not  been  for  our\nheroic  Leader,  Comrade\nNapoleon.<br><br>Do you not remember\nhow, just at the moment when Jones and\nhis  men  had  got  inside  the  yard,\nSnowball  suddenly  turned  and  fled,  and\nmany animals followed him? And do you\nnot remember, too, that it was just at that\nmoment, when panic was spreading and\nall  seemed  lost,  that  Comrade  Napoleon\nsprang  forward  with  a  cry  of  'Death\nto<br><br>Humanity!' and sank his teeth\nin  Jones's  leg?  Surely  you\nremember<br><br>THAT,  comrades?\"\nexclaimed Squealer, frisking from side to\nside.<br><br>Now  when  Squealer\ndescribed  the  scene  so  graphically,  it\nseemed  to  the  animals  that  they  did", "remember  it.  At  any  rate,  they\nremembered  that  at  the  critical  moment\nof the battle Snowball had turned to flee.\nBut  Boxer  was  still  a  little  uneasy.  \"I  do\nnot believe that Snowball was a traitor at\nthe  beginning,\"  he  said  finally.  \"What  he\nhas done since is different. But I believe\nthat at the Battle of the Cowshed he was\na good comrade.\" \"Our Leader, Comrade\nNapoleon,\"  announced  Squealer,\nspeaking  very  slowly  and  firmly,  \"has\nstated  categorically  -  categorically,\ncomrade  -  that  Snowball  was  Jones's\nagent from the very beginning - yes, and\nfrom  long  before  the  Rebellion  was  ever\nthought  of.\"  \"Ah,  that  is  different!\"  said\nBoxer.  \"If  Comrade  Napoleon  says  it,  it\nmust  be  right.\"  \"That  is  the  true  spirit,\ncomrade!\"  cried  Squealer,  but  it  was\nnoticed he cast a very ugly look at Boxer\nwith his little twinkling eyes. He turned to\ngo, then paused and added impressively:\n\"I warn every animal on this farm to keep\nhis  eyes  very  wide  open.  For  we  have\nreason  to  think  that  some  of  Snowball's\nsecret  agents  are  lurking  among  us  at\nthis moment!\"<br><br>Four days later, in", "the  late  afternoon,  Napoleon  ordered  all\nthe  animals  to  assemble  in  the  yard.\nWhen  they  were  all  gathered\ntogether,<br><br>Napoleon  emerged\nfrom  the  farmhouse,  wearing  both  his\nmedals  (for  he  had  recently  awarded\nhimself  \"Animal  Hero,  First  Class\",  and\n\"Animal  Hero,  Second  Class\"),  with  his\nnine  huge  dogs  frisking  round  him  and\nuttering growls that sent shivers down all\nthe  animals'  spines.<br><br>They  all\ncowered silently in their places, seeming\nto  know  in  advance  that  some  terrible\nthing  was  about  to\nhappen.<br><br>Napoleon  stood  sternly\nsurveying his audience; then he uttered a\nhigh-pitched  whimper.  Immediately  the\ndogs bounded forward, seized four of the\npigs  by  the  ear  and  dragged  them,\nsquealing  with  pain  and  terror,  to\nNapoleon's  feet.  The  pigs'  ears  were\nbleeding, the dogs had tasted blood, and\nfor  a  few  moments  they  appeared  to  go\nquite  mad.  To  the  amazement  of\neverybody,  three  of  them  flung\nthemselves  upon<br><br>Boxer.  Boxer\nsaw  them  coming  and  put  out  his  great", "hoof, caught a dog in mid-air, and pinned\nhim  to  the  ground.  The  dog  shrieked  for\nmercy  and  the  other  two  fled  with  their\ntails  between  their  legs.  Boxer  looked  at\nNapoleon  to  know  whether  he  should\ncrush  the  dog  to  death  or  let  it  go.\nNapoleon  appeared  to  change\ncountenance,  and  sharply\nordered<br><br>Boxer to let the dog go,\nwhereat  Boxer  lifted  his  hoof,  and  the\ndog  slunk  away,  bruised  and\nhowling.<br><br>Presently  the  tumult\ndied  down.  The  four  pigs  waited,\ntrembling,  with  guilt  written  on  every  line\nof  their  countenances.  Napoleon  now\ncalled upon them to confess their crimes.\nThey  were  the  same  four  pigs  as  had\nprotested  when  Napoleon  abolished  the\nSunday  Meetings.<br><br>Without  any\nfurther  prompting  they  confessed  that\nthey  had  been  secretly  in  touch  with\nSnowball  ever  since  his  expulsion,  that\nthey  had  collaborated  with  him  in\ndestroying  the  windmill,  and  that  they\nhad  entered  into  an  agreement  with  him\nto  hand  over  Animal  Farm  to\nMr.<br><br>Frederick.  They  added  that", "Snowball  had  privately  admitted  to  them\nthat he had been Jones's secret agent for\nyears past. When they had finished their\nconfession,  the  dogs  promptly  tore  their\nthroats  out,  and  in  a  terrible  voice\nNapoleon  demanded  whether  any  other\nanimal  had  anything  to\nconfess.<br><br>The  three  hens  who\nhad  been  the  ringleaders  in  the\nattempted  rebellion  over  the  eggs  now\ncame  forward  and  stated  that  Snowball\nhad  appeared  to  them  in  a  dream  and\nincited  them  to\ndisobey<br><br>Napoleon's  orders.\nThey,  too,  were  slaughtered.  Then  a\ngoose  came  forward  and  confessed  to\nhaving  secreted  six  ears  of  corn  during\nthe last year's harvest and eaten them in\nthe  night.  Then  a  sheep  confessed  to\nhaving  urinated  in  the  drinking  pool  -\nurged  to  do  this,  so  she  said,  by\nSnowball  -  and  two  other  sheep\nconfessed  to  having  murdered  an  old\nram,  an  especially  devoted  follower  of\nNapoleon,  by  chasing  him  round  and\nround  a  bonfire  when  he  was  suffering\nfrom a cough. They were all slain on the", "spot. And so the tale of confessions and\nexecutions went on, until there was a pile\nof  corpses  lying  before  Napoleon's  feet\nand  the  air  was  heavy  with  the  smell  of\nblood,  which  had  been  unknown  there\nsince  the  expulsion  of\nJones.<br><br>When it was all over, the\nremaining  animals,  except  for  the  pigs\nand  dogs,  crept  away  in  a  body.  They\nwere shaken and miserable. They did not\nknow  which  was  more  shocking  -  the\ntreachery  of  the  animals  who  had\nleagued  themselves  with  Snowball,  or\nthe  cruel  retribution  they  had  just\nwitnessed.  In  the  old  days  there  had\noften  been  scenes  of  bloodshed  equally\nterrible, but it seemed to all of them that it\nwas far worse now that it was happening\namong themselves. Since Jones had left\nthe farm, until today, no animal had killed\nanother animal. Not even a rat had been\nkilled. They had made their way on to the\nlittle knoll where the half-finished windmill\nstood,  and  with  one  accord  they  all  lay\ndown  as  though  huddling  together  for\nwarmth  -  Clover,\nMuriel,<br><br>Benjamin,  the  cows,  the", "sheep,  and  a  whole  flock  of  geese  and\nhens - everyone, indeed, except the cat,\nwho  had  suddenly  disappeared  just\nbefore  Napoleon  ordered  the  animals  to\nassemble. For some time nobody spoke.\nOnly  Boxer  remained  on  his  feet.  He\nfidgeted  to  and  fro,  swishing  his  long\nblack  tail  against  his  sides  and\noccasionally  uttering  a  little  whinny  of\nsurprise.  Finally  he  said:  \"I  do  not\nunderstand  it.  I  would  not  have  believed\nthat  such  things  could  happen  on  our\nfarm.  It  must  be  due  to  some  fault  in\nourselves.<br><br>The solution, as I see\nit, is to work harder. From now onwards I\nshall  get  up  a  full  hour  earlier  in  the\nmornings.\"<br><br>And  he  moved  off  at\nhis  lumbering  trot  and  made  for  the\nquarry.<br><br>Having  got  there,  he\ncollected  two  successive  loads  of  stone\nand  dragged  them  down  to  the  windmill\nbefore  retiring  for  the  night.<br><br>The\nanimals  huddled  about  Clover,  not\nspeaking.  The  knoll  where  they  were\nlying  gave  them  a  wide  prospect  across\nthe  countryside.<br><br>Most  of  Animal\nFarm  was  within  their  view  -  the  long", "pasture  stretching  down  to  the  main\nroad,  the  hayfield,  the  spinney,  the\ndrinking  pool,  the  ploughed  fields  where\nthe  young  wheat  was  thick  and  green,\nand  the  red  roofs  of  the  farm  buildings\nwith  the  smoke  curling  from  the\nchimneys.  It  was  a  clear  spring  evening.\nThe grass and the bursting hedges were\ngilded by the level rays of the sun. Never\nhad the farm - and with a kind of surprise\nthey  remembered  that  it  was  their  own\nfarm, every inch of it their own property -\nappeared  to  the  animals  so  desirable  a\nplace. As Clover looked down the hillside\nher  eyes  filled  with  tears.  If  she  could\nhave spoken her thoughts, it would have\nbeen  to  say  that  this  was  not  what  they\nhad  aimed  at  when  they  had  set\nthemselves  years  ago  to  work  for  the\noverthrow  of  the  human  race.  These\nscenes  of  terror  and  slaughter  were  not\nwhat  they  had  looked  forward  to  on  that\nnight when old Major first stirred them to\nrebellion.  If  she  herself  had  had  any\npicture  of  the  future,  it  had  been  of  a\nsociety  of  animals  set  free  from  hunger\nand  the  whip,  all  equal,  each  working", "according  to  his  capacity,  the  strong\nprotecting  the  weak,  as  she  had\nprotected the lost brood of ducklings with\nher  foreleg  on  the  night  of  Major's\nspeech. Instead - she did not know why -\nthey  had  come  to  a  time  when  no  one\ndared  speak  his  mind,  when  fierce,\ngrowling  dogs  roamed  everywhere,  and\nwhen  you  had  to  watch  your  comrades\ntorn  to  pieces  after  confessing  to\nshocking  crimes.  There  was  no  thought\nof  rebellion  or  disobedience  in  her  mind.\nShe knew that, even as things were, they\nwere far better off than they had been in\nthe  days  of  Jones,  and  that  before  all\nelse  it  was  needful  to  prevent  the  return\nof  the  human  beings.  Whatever\nhappened  she  would  remain  faithful,\nwork hard, carry out the orders that were\ngiven to her, and accept the leadership of\nNapoleon. But still, it was not for this that\nshe and all the other animals had hoped\nand  toiled.  It  was  not  for  this  that  they\nhad  built  the  windmill  and  faced  the\nbullets  of  Jones's  gun.  Such  were  her\nthoughts, though she lacked the words to\nexpress  them.<br><br>At  last,  feeling", "this  to  be  in  some  way  a  substitute  for\nthe  words  she  was  unable  to  find,  she\nbegan  to  sing  'Beasts  of  England'.  The\nother animals sitting round her took it up,\nand  they  sang  it  three  times  over  -  very\ntunefully,  but  slowly  and  mournfully,  in  a\nway  they  had  never  sung  it\nbefore.<br><br>They  had  just  finished\nsinging  it  for  the  third  time  when\nSquealer,  attended  by  two  dogs,\napproached  them  with  the  air  of  having\nsomething  important  to  say.  He\nannounced  that,  by  a  special  decree\nof<br><br>Comrade  Napoleon,  'Beasts\nof  England'  had  been  abolished.  From\nnow  onwards  it  was  forbidden  to  sing\nit.<br><br>The  animals  were  taken\naback.  \"Why?\"  cried  Muriel.  \"It's  no\nlonger  needed,  comrade,\"  said  Squealer\nstiffly.  \"'Beasts  of<br><br>England'  was\nthe  song  of  the  Rebellion.  But  the\nRebellion is now ", "#$#$Chapter  8#$#$<br><br>A  few  days\nlater,  when  the  terror  caused  by  the\nexecutions  had  died  down,  some  of  the\nanimals  remembered  -  or  thought  they\nremembered  -  that  the  Sixth\nCommandment decreed \"No animal shall\nkill any other animal.\" And though no one\ncared  to  mention  it  in  the  hearing  of  the\npigs  or  the  dogs,  it  was  felt  that  the\nkillings  which  had  taken  place  did  not\nsquare  with  this.  Clover\nasked<br><br>Benjamin  to  read  her  the\nSixth  Commandment,  and  when\nBenjamin, as usual, said that he refused\nto  meddle  in  such  matters,  she\nfetched<br><br>Muriel.  Muriel  read  the\nCommandment for her. It ran: \"No animal\nshall  kill  any  other  animal  WITHOUT\nCAUSE.\" Somehow or other, the last two\nwords  had  slipped  out  of  the  animals'\nmemory.  But  they  saw  now  that  the\nCommandment  had  not  been  violated;\nfor  clearly  there  was  good  reason  for\nkilling  the  traitors  who  had  leagued\nthemselves  with\nSnowball.<br><br>Throughout  the  year\nthe  animals  worked  even  harder  than", "they had worked in the previous year. To\nrebuild  the  windmill,  with  walls  twice  as\nthick  as  before,  and  to  finish  it  by  the\nappointed date, together with the regular\nwork  of  the  farm,  was  a  tremendous\nlabour. There were times when it seemed\nto  the  animals  that  they  worked  longer\nhours  and  fed  no  better  than  they  had\ndone  in  Jones's  day.  On  Sunday\nmornings  Squealer,  holding  down  a  long\nstrip of paper with his trotter, would read\nout  to  them  lists  of  figures  proving  that\nthe production of every class of foodstuff\nhad  increased  by  two  hundred  per  cent,\nthree  hundred  per  cent,  or  five  hundred\nper  cent,  as  the  case  might  be.  The\nanimals saw no reason to disbelieve him,\nespecially  as  they  could  no  longer\nremember  very  clearly  what  conditions\nhad  been  like  before\nthe<br><br>Rebellion.  All  the  same,\nthere were days when they felt that they\nwould  sooner  have  had  less  figures  and\nmore  food.  All  orders  were  now  issued\nthrough  Squealer  or  one  of  the  other\npigs.  Napoleon  himself  was  not  seen  in\npublic  as  often  as  once  in  a  fortnight.", "When  he  did  appear,  he  was  attended\nnot  only  by  his  retinue  of  dogs  but  by  a\nblack  cockerel  who  marched  in  front  of\nhim  and  acted  as  a  kind  of  trumpeter,\nletting  out  a  loud  \"cock-a-doodle-doo\"\nbefore<br><br>Napoleon spoke. Even in\nthe  farmhouse,  it  was  said,  Napoleon\ninhabited  separate  apartments  from  the\nothers. He took his meals alone, with two\ndogs  to  wait  upon  him,  and  always  ate\nfrom  the  Crown<br><br>Derby  dinner\nservice  which  had  been  in  the  glass\ncupboard  in  the  drawing-room.  It  was\nalso  announced  that  the  gun  would  be\nfired  every  year  on  Napoleon's  birthday,\nas  well  as  on  the  other  two\nanniversaries.<br><br>Napoleon  was\nnow  never  spoken  of  simply  as\n\"Napoleon.\" He was always referred to in\nformal  style  as  \"our  Leader,  Comrade\nNapoleon,\"  and  this  pigs  liked  to  invent\nfor  him  such  titles  as  Father  of\nAll<br><br>Animals,  Terror  of  Mankind,\nProtector  of  the  Sheep-fold,\nDucklings'<br><br>Friend,  and  the  like.\nIn his speeches, Squealer would talk with\nthe  tears  rolling  down  his  cheeks  of", "Napoleon's  wisdom  the  goodness  of  his\nheart,  and  the  deep  love  he  bore  to  all\nanimals everywhere, even and especially\nthe  unhappy  animals  who  still  lived  in\nignorance  and  slavery  on  other  farms.  It\nhad  become  usual  to  give  Napoleon  the\ncredit  for  every  successful  achievement\nand  every  stroke  of  good  fortune.  You\nwould  often  hear  one  hen  remark  to\nanother,  \"Under  the  guidance  of  our\nLeader,  Comrade  Napoleon,  I  have  laid\nfive  eggs  in  six  days\";  or  two  cows,\nenjoying  a  drink  at  the  pool,  would\nexclaim,  \"Thanks  to  the  leadership  of\nComrade  Napoleon,  how  excellent  this\nwater tastes!\" The general feeling on the\nfarm  was  well  expressed  in  a  poem\nentitled<br><br>Comrade  Napoleon,\nwhich  was  composed  by  Minimus  and\nwhich  ran  as  follows:<br><br>Friend  of\nfatherless!<br><br>Fountain  of\nhappiness!  Lord  of  the  swill-bucket!  Oh,\nhow  my  soul  is  on<br><br>Fire  when  I\ngaze  at  thy<br><br>Calm  and\ncommanding  eye,<br><br>Like  the  sun\nin  the  sky,<br><br>Comrade\nNapoleon!<br><br>Thou  are  the  giver", "of<br><br>All  that  thy  creatures\nlove,<br><br>Full  belly  twice  a  day,\nclean  straw  to  roll  upon;<br><br>Every\nbeast  great  or  small<br><br>Sleeps  at\npeace in his stall,<br><br>Thou watchest\nover  all,<br><br>Comrade\nNapoleon!<br><br>Had  I  a\nsucking-pig,<br><br>Ere  he  had  grown\nas big<br><br>Even as a pint bottle or as\na  rolling-pin,<br><br>He  should  have\nlearned to be<br><br>Faithful and true to\nthee,<br><br>Yes,  his  first  squeak\nshould  be  \"Comrade\nNapoleon!\"<br><br>Napoleon  approved\nof  this  poem  and  caused  it  to  be\ninscribed  on  the  wall  of  the  big  barn,  at\nthe  opposite  end  from  the\nSeven<br><br>Commandments.  It  was\nsurmounted by a portrait of Napoleon, in\nprofile,  executed  by  Squealer  in  white\npaint.<br><br>Meanwhile,  through  the\nagency  of  Whymper,  Napoleon  was\nengaged in complicated negotiations with\nFrederick  and  Pilkington.  The  pile  of\ntimber  was  still  unsold.  Of  the  two,\nFrederick  was  the  more  anxious  to  get\nhold  of  it,  but  he  would  not  offer  a", "reasonable price. At the same time there\nwere  renewed  rumours  that  Frederick\nand  his  men  were  plotting  to  attack\nAnimal Farm and to destroy the windmill,\nthe building of which had aroused furious\njealousy  in  him.  Snowball  was  known  to\nbe  still  skulking  on  Pinchfield  Farm.  In\nthe  middle  of  the  summer  the  animals\nwere alarmed to hear that three hens had\ncome  forward  and  confessed  that,\ninspired  by  Snowball,  they  had  entered\ninto  a  plot  to  murder  Napoleon.  They\nwere  executed  immediately,  and  fresh\nprecautions  for  Napoleon's  safety  were\ntaken.  Four  dogs  guarded  his  bed  at\nnight,  one  at  each  corner,  and  a  young\npig named Pinkeye was given the task of\ntasting all his food before he ate it, lest it\nshould  be  poisoned.<br><br>At  about\nthe  same  time  it  was  given  out  that\nNapoleon had arranged to sell the pile of\ntimber  to  Mr.  Pilkington;  he  was  also\ngoing  to  enter  into  a  regular  agreement\nfor  the  exchange  of  certain  products\nbetween Animal Farm and Foxwood. The\nrelations  between  Napoleon  and\nPilkington,  though  they  were  only", "conducted  through  Whymper,  were  now\nalmost  friendly.  The  animals  distrusted\nPilkington, as a human being, but greatly\npreferred  him  to  Frederick,  whom  they\nboth  feared  and  hated.  As  the  summer\nwore  on,  and  the  windmill  neared\ncompletion, the rumours of an impending\ntreacherous  attack  grew  stronger  and\nstronger. Frederick, it was said, intended\nto  bring  against  them  twenty  men  all\narmed  with  guns,  and  he  had  already\nbribed the magistrates and police, so that\nif  he  could  once  get  hold  of  the  title-\ndeeds of Animal Farm they would ask no\nquestions. Moreover, terrible stories were\nleaking  out  from  Pinchfield  about  the\ncruelties that<br><br>Frederick practised\nupon his animals. He had flogged an old\nhorse  to  death,  he  starved  his  cows,  he\nhad  killed  a  dog  by  throwing  it  into  the\nfurnace,  he  amused  himself  in  the\nevenings  by  making  cocks  fight  with\nsplinters  of  razor-blade  tied  to  their\nspurs.  The  animals'  blood  boiled  with\nrage  when  they  heard  of  these  things\nbeingdone  to  their  comrades,  and\nsometimes they clamoured to be allowed", "to go out in a body and attack Pinchfield\nFarm, drive out the humans, and set the\nanimals  free.  But  Squealer  counselled\nthem  to  avoid  rash  actions  and  trust  in\nComrade  Napoleon's\nstrategy.<br><br>Nevertheless,  feeling\nagainst  Frederick  continued  to  run  high.\nOne<br><br>Sunday  morning  Napoleon\nappeared  in  the  barn  and  explained  that\nhe  had  never  at  any  time  contemplated\nselling  the  pile  of  timber\nto<br><br>Frederick;  he  considered  it\nbeneath  his  dignity,  he  said,  to  have\ndealings  with  scoundrels  of  that\ndescription.  The  pigeons  who  were  still\nsent  out  to  spread  tidings  of  the\nRebellion  were  forbidden  to  set  foot\nanywhere  on  Foxwood,  and  were  also\nordered  to  drop  their  former  slogan  of\n\"Death  to  Humanity\"  in  favour  of  \"Death\nto  Frederick.\"  In  the  late  summer  yet\nanother  of  Snowball's  machinations  was\nlaid  bare.  The  wheat  crop  was  full  of\nweeds, and it was discovered that on one\nof  his  nocturnal  visits  Snowball  had\nmixed weed seeds with the seed corn. A\ngander  who  had  been  privy  to  the  plot", "had  confessed  his  guilt\nto<br><br>Squealer  and  immediately\ncommitted  suicide  by  swallowing  deadly\nnightshade  berries.  The  animals  now\nalso  learned  that  Snowball  had  never  -\nas  many  of  them  had  believed  hitherto  -\nreceived the order of \"Animal Hero, First\nClass.\"  This  was  merely  a  legend  which\nhad  been  spread  some  time  after  the\nBattle  of  the  Cowshed  by  Snowball\nhimself.<br><br>So  far  from  being\ndecorated,  he  had  been  censured  for\nshowing  cowardice  in  the  battle.  Once\nagain  some  of  the  animals  heard  this\nwith a certain bewilderment, but Squealer\nwas  soon  able  to  convince  them  that\ntheir  memories  had  been  at\nfault.<br><br>In  the  autumn,  by  a\ntremendous,  exhausting  effort  -  for  the\nharvest had to be gathered at almost the\nsame  time  -  the  windmill  was  finished.\nThe  machinery  had  still  to  be  installed,\nand  Whymper  was  negotiating  the\npurchase  of  it,  but  the  structure  was\ncompleted. In the teeth of every difficulty,\nin  spite  of  inexperience,  of  primitive\nimplements,  of  bad  luck  and  of", "Snowball's treachery, the work had been\nfinished punctually to the very day! Tired\nout but proud, the animals walked round\nand  round  their  masterpiece,  which\nappeared  even  more  beautiful  in  their\neyes than when it had been built the first\ntime.  Moreover,  the  walls  were  twice  as\nthick  as  before.  Nothing  short  of\nexplosives  would  lay  them  low  this  time!\nAnd  when  they  thought  of  how  they  had\nlaboured,  what  discouragements  they\nhad  overcome,  and  the  enormous\ndifference  that  would  be  made  in  their\nlives when the sails were turning and the\ndynamos running - when they thought of\nall  this,  their  tiredness  forsook  them  and\nthey  gambolled  round  and  round  the\nwindmill,  uttering  cries  of  triumph.\nNapoleon  himself,  attended  by  his  dogs\nand  his  cockerel,  came  down  to  inspect\nthe  completed  work;  he  personally\ncongratulated  the  animals  on  their\nachievement,  and  announced  that  the\nmill  would  be  named\nNapoleon<br><br>Mill.<br><br>Two\ndays  later  the  animals  were  called\ntogether  for  a  special  meeting  in  the", "barn.  They  were  struck  dumb  with\nsurprise  when<br><br>Napoleon\nannounced  that  he  had  sold  the  pile  of\ntimber  to  Frederick.<br><br>Tomorrow\nFrederick's  wagons  would  arrive  and\nbegin  carting  it\naway.<br><br>Throughout  the  whole\nperiod  of  his  seeming  friendship\nwith<br><br>Pilkington,  Napoleon  had\nreally  been  in  secret  agreement\nwith<br><br>Frederick.<br><br>All\nrelations with Foxwood had been broken\noff; insulting messages had been sent to\nPilkington. The pigeons had been told to\navoid  Pinchfield  Farm  and  to  alter  their\nslogan from \"Death to<br><br>Frederick\"\nto \"Death to Pilkington.\" At the same time\nNapoleon  assured  the  animals  that  the\nstories  of  an  impending  attack  on\nAnimal<br><br>Farm  were  completely\nuntrue,  and  that  the  tales  about\nFrederick's  cruelty  to  his  own  animals\nhad  been  greatly  exaggerated.  All  these\nrumours  had  probably  originated  with\nSnowball  and  his  agents.  It  now\nappeared that Snowball was not, after all,\nhiding  on  Pinchfield  Farm,  and  in  fact", "had  never  been  there  in  his  life:  he  was\nliving  -  in  considerable  luxury,  so  it  was\nsaid  -  at  Foxwood,  and  had  in  reality\nbeen  a  pensioner  of  Pilkington  for  years\npast.<br><br>The pigs were in ecstasies\nover Napoleon's cunning. By seeming to\nbe  friendly  with  Pilkington  he  had  forced\nFrederick  to  raise  his  price  by  twelve\npounds.  But  the  superior  quality  of\nNapoleon's mind, said<br><br>Squealer,\nwas  shown  in  the  fact  that  he  trusted\nnobody,  not  even<br><br>Frederick.\nFrederick  had  wanted  to  pay  for  the\ntimber  with  something  called  a  cheque,\nwhich,  it  seemed,  was  a  piece  of  paper\nwith a promise to pay written upon it. But\nNapoleon was too clever for him. He had\ndemanded  payment  in  real  five-pound\nnotes,  which  were  to  be  handed  over\nbefore  the  timber  was  removed.  Already\nFrederick  had  paid  up;  and  the  sum  he\nhad  paid  was  just  enough  to  buy  the\nmachinery  for  the\nwindmill.<br><br>Meanwhile  the  timber\nwas  being  carted  away  at  high  speed.\nWhen  it  was  all  gone,  another  special\nmeeting  was  held  in  the  barn  for  the", "animals  to  inspect  Frederick's\nbank-notes.  Smiling  beatifically,  and\nwearing  both  his  decorations,  Napoleon\nreposed  on  a  bed  of  straw  on  the\nplatform,  with  the  money  at  his  side,\nneatly  piled  on  a  china  dish  from  the\nfarmhouse  kitchen.  The  animals  filed\nslowly past, and each gazed his fill. And\nBoxer  put  out  his  nose  to  sniff  at  the\nbank-notes,  and  the  flimsy  white  things\nstirred  and  rustled  in  his\nbreath.<br><br>Three  days  later  there\nwas  a  terrible  hullabaloo.  Whymper,  his\nface  deadly  pale,  came  racing  up  the\npath  on  his  bicycle,  flung  it  down  in  the\nyard  and  rushed  straight  into  the\nfarmhouse.  The  next  moment  a  choking\nroar  of  rage  sounded  from  Napoleon's\napartments.  The  news  of  what  had\nhappened  sped  round  the  farm  like\nwildfire.  The  banknotes  were  forgeries!\nFrederick  had  got  the  timber  for\nnothing!<br><br>Napoleon  called  the\nanimals  together  immediately  and  in  a\nterrible  voice  pronounced  the  death\nsentence  upon  Frederick.  When\ncaptured,  he  said,  Frederick  should  be", "boiled alive. At the same time he warned\nthem that after this treacherous deed the\nworst was to be expected. Frederick and\nhis  men  might  make  their  long-expected\nattack  at  any  moment.  Sentinels  were\nplaced at all the approaches to the farm.\nIn  addition,  four  pigeons  were  sent  to\nFoxwood  with  a  conciliatory  message,\nwhich  it  was  hoped  might  re-establish\ngood  relations  with\nPilkington.<br><br>The  very  next\nmorning  the  attack  came.  The  animals\nwere  at  breakfast  when  the  look-outs\ncame  racing  in  with  the  news\nthat<br><br>Frederick  and  his  followers\nhad already come through the five-barred\ngate.  Boldly  enough  the  animals  sallied\nforth to meet them, but this time they did\nnot  have  the  easy  victory  that  they  had\nhad  in  the  Battle  of  the  Cowshed.  There\nwere fifteen men, with half a dozen guns\nbetween  them,  and  they  opened  fire  as\nsoon  as  they  got  within  fifty  yards.  The\nanimals  could  not  face  the  terrible\nexplosions  and  the  stinging  pellets,  and\nin  spite  of  the  efforts  of  Napoleon  and\nBoxer  to  rally  them,  they  were  soon", "driven  back.  A  number  of  them  were\nalready  wounded.  They  took  refuge  in\nthe farm buildings and peeped cautiously\nout  from  chinks  and  knot-holes.  The\nwhole  of  the  big  pasture,  including  the\nwindmill, was in the hands of the enemy.\nFor the moment even Napoleon seemed\nat a loss. He paced up and down without\na word, his tail rigid and twitching. Wistful\nglances  were  sent  in  the  direction  of\nFoxwood.  If  Pilkington  and  his  men\nwould  help  them,  the  day  might  yet  be\nwon.  But  at  this  moment  the  four\npigeons,  who  had  been  sent  out  on  the\nday  before,  returned,  one  of  them\nbearing a scrap of paper from Pilkington.\nOn  it  was  pencilled  the  words:  \"Serves\nyou  right.\"<br><br>Meanwhile  Frederick\nand  his  men  had  halted  about  the\nwindmill.<br><br>The  animals  watched\nthem,  and  a  murmur  of  dismay  went\nround.  Two  of  the  men  had  produced  a\ncrowbar  and  a  sledge  hammer.  They\nwere  going  to  knock  the  windmill  down.\n\"Impossible!\"  cried  Napoleon.  \"We  have\nbuilt the walls far too thick for that. They\ncould  not  knock  it  down  in  a  week.", "Courage,  comrades!\"<br><br>But\nBenjamin  was  watching  the  movements\nof the men intently.<br><br>The two with\nthe  hammer  and  the  crowbar  were\ndrilling  a  hole  near  the  base  of  the\nwindmill.  Slowly,  and  with  an  air  almost\nof  amusement,<br><br>Benjamin\nnodded  his  long  muzzle.  \"I  thought  so,\"\nhe  said.  \"Do  you  not  see  what  they  are\ndoing? In another moment they are going\nto  pack  blasting  powder  into  that\nhole.\"<br><br>Terrified,  the  animals\nwaited. It was impossible now to venture\nout of the shelter of the buildings. After a\nfew  minutes  the  men  were  seen  to  be\nrunning  in  all  directions.  Then  there  was\na  deafening  roar.<br><br>The  pigeons\nswirled  into  the  air,  and  all  the  animals,\nexcept  Napoleon,  flung  themselves  flat\non their bellies and hid their faces. When\nthey got up again, a huge cloud of black\nsmoke  was  hanging  where  the  windmill\nhad  been.  Slowly  the  breeze  drifted  it\naway.  The  windmill  had  ceased  to\nexist!<br><br>At  this  sight  the  animals'\ncourage  returned  to  them.  The  fear  and\ndespair  they  had  felt  a  moment  earlier", "were  drowned  in  their  rage  against  this\nvile,  contemptible  act.  A  mighty  cry  for\nvengeance  went  up,  and  without  waiting\nfor further orders they charged forth in a\nbody  and  made  straight  for  the  enemy.\nThis  time  they  did  not  heed  the  cruel\npellets  that  swept  over  them  like  hail.  It\nwas a savage, bitter battle. The men fired\nagain  and  again,  and,  when  the  animals\ngot  to  close  quarters,  lashed  out  with\ntheir sticks and their heavy boots. A cow,\nthree  sheep,  and  two  geese  were  killed,\nand  nearly  everyone  was  wounded.\nEven<br><br>Napoleon,  who  was\ndirecting  operations  from  the  rear,  had\nthe tip of his tail chipped by a pellet. But\nthe  men  did  not  go  unscathed\neither.<br><br>Three  of  them  had  their\nheads  broken  by  blows  from  Boxer's\nhoofs; another was gored in the belly by\na  cow's  horn;  another  had  his  trousers\nnearly  torn  off  by  Jessie  and  Bluebell.\nAnd  when  the  nine  dogs  of  Napoleon's\nown bodyguard, whom he had instructed\nto  make  a  detour  under  cover  of  the\nhedge,  suddenly  appeared  on  the  men's\nflank,  baying  ferociously,  panic  overtook", "them. They saw that they were in danger\nof  being  surrounded.  Frederick  shouted\nto his men to get out while the going was\ngood, and the next moment the cowardly\nenemy  was  running  for  dear  life.  The\nanimals  chased  them  right  down  to  the\nbottom  of  the  field,  and  got  in  some  last\nkicks  at  them  as  they  forced  their  way\nthrough  the  thorn  hedge.<br><br>They\nhad  won,  but  they  were  weary  and\nbleeding. Slowly they began to limp back\ntowards the farm. The sight of their dead\ncomrades  stretched  upon  the  grass\nmoved some of them to tears. And for a\nlittle while they halted in sorrowful silence\nat the place where the windmill had once\nstood.  Yes,  it  was  gone;  almost  the  last\ntrace of their labour was gone! Even the\nfoundations were partially destroyed. And\nin rebuilding it they could not this time, as\nbefore,  make  use  of  the  fallen  stones.\nThis  time  the  stones  had  vanished  too.\nThe  force  of  the  explosion  had  flung\nthem to distances of hundreds of yards. It\nwas  as  though  the  windmill  had  never\nbeen.<br><br>As  they  approached  the\nfarm  Squealer,  who  had  unaccountably", "been  absent  during  the  fighting,  came\nskipping  towards  them,  whisking  his  tail\nand  beaming  with  satisfaction.  And  the\nanimals  heard,  from  the  direction  of  the\nfarm  buildings,  the  solemn  booming  of  a\ngun.  \"What  is  that  gun  firing  for?\"  said\nBoxer.  \"To  celebrate  our  victory!\"  cried\nSquealer. \"What victory?\" said Boxer. His\nknees were bleeding, he had lost a shoe\nand  split  his  hoof,  and  a  dozen  pellets\nhad  lodged  themselves  in  his  hind  leg.\n\"What  victory,  comrade?  Have  we  not\ndriven the enemy off our soil - the sacred\nsoil  of  Animal  Farm?\"  \"But  they  have\ndestroyed  the  windmill.  And  we  had\nworked  on  it  for  two  years!\"  \"What\nmatter?  We  will  build  another  windmill.\nWe  will  build  six  windmills  if  we  feel  like\nit.  You  do  not  appreciate,  comrade,  the\nmighty  thing  that  we  have  done.  The\nenemy  was  in  occupation  of  this  very\nground  that  we  stand  upon.  And  now  -\nthanks  to  the  leadership\nof<br><br>Comrade Napoleon - we have\nwon  every  inch  of  it  back  again!\"  \"Then\nwe have won back what we had before,\"\nsaid  Boxer.  \"That  is  our  victory,\"  said", "Squealer.<br><br>They  limped  into  the\nyard.  The  pellets  under  the  skin  of\nBoxer's  leg  smarted  painfully.  He  saw\nahead  of  him  the  heavy  labour  of\nrebuilding  the  windmill  from  the\nfoundations,  and  already  in  imagination\nhe braced himself for the task. But for the\nfirst  time  it  occurred  to  him  that  he  was\neleven  years  old  and  that  perhaps  his\ngreat  muscles  were  not  quite  what  they\nhad  once  been.<br><br>But  when  the\nanimals  saw  the  green  flag  flying,  and\nheard the gun firing again - seven times it\nwas  fired  in  all  -  and  heard  the  speech\nthat Napoleon made, congratulating them\non  their  conduct,  it  did  seem  to  them\nafter all that they had won a great victory.\nThe animals slain in the battle were given\na  solemn  funeral.  Boxer  and  Clover\npulled  the  wagon  which  served  as  a\nhearse,  and  Napoleon  himself  walked  at\nthe  head  of  the  procession.  Two  whole\ndays  were  given  over  to  celebrations.\nThere  were  songs,  speeches,  and  more\nfiring of the gun, and a special gift of an\napple  was  bestowed  on  every  animal,\nwith two ounces of corn for each bird and", "three  biscuits  for  each  dog.  It  was\nannounced  that  the  battle  would  be\ncalled the Battle of the Windmill, and that\nNapoleon had created a new decoration,\nthe  Order  of  the<br><br>Green  Banner,\nwhich  he  had  conferred  upon  himself.  In\nthe  general  rejoicings  the  unfortunate\naffair  of  the  banknotes  was\nforgotten.<br><br>It was a few days later\nthan this that the pigs came upon a case\nof whisky in the cellars of the farmhouse.\nIt had been overlooked at the time when\nthe  house  was  first  occupied.  That  night\nthere  came  from  the  farmhouse  the\nsound  of  loud  singing,  in  which,  to\neveryone's  surprise,  the  strains  of\n'Beasts  of  England'  were  mixed  up.  At\nabout  half  past  nine  Napoleon,  wearing\nan  old  bowler  hat  of  Mr.  Jones's,  was\ndistinctly  seen  to  emerge  from  the  back\ndoor,  gallop  rapidly  round  the  yard,  and\ndisappear  indoors  again.  But  in  the\nmorning  a  deep  silence  hung  over  the\nfarmhouse.  Not  a  pig  appeared  to  be\nstirring.  It  was  nearly  nine  o'clock  when\nSquealer  made  his  appearance,  walking\nslowly  and  dejectedly,  his  eyes  dull,  his", "tail  hanging  limply  behind  him,  and  with\nevery  appearance  of  being  seriously  ill.\nHe  called  the  animals  together  and  told\nthem that he had a terrible piece of news\nto  impart.<br><br>Comrade  Napoleon\nwas  dying!<br><br>A  cry  of  lamentation\nwent up. Straw was laid down outside the\ndoors of the farmhouse, and the animals\nwalked on tiptoe. With tears in their eyes\nthey asked one another what they should\ndo  if  their<br><br>Leader  were  taken\naway  from  them.  A  rumour  went  round\nthat<br><br>Snowball  had  after  all\ncontrived  to  introduce  poison  into\nNapoleon's  food.  At  eleven  o'clock\nSquealer  came  out  to  make  another\nannouncement.  As  his  last  act  upon\nearth,  Comrade  Napoleon  had\npronounced  a  solemn  decree:  the\ndrinking of alcohol was to be punished by\ndeath.<br><br>By the evening, however,\nNapoleon  appeared  to  be  somewhat\nbetter,  and  the  following  morning\nSquealer  was  able  to  tell  them  that  he\nwas  well  on  the  way  to  recovery.  By  the\nevening  of  that  day<br><br>Napoleon\nwas back at work, and on the next day it", "was  learned  that  he  had  instructed\nWhymper  to  purchase  in  Willingdon\nsome  booklets  on  brewing  and  distilling.\nA  week  later  Napoleon  gave  orders  that\nthe  small  paddock  beyond  the  orchard,\nwhich it had previously been intended to\nset aside as a grazing-ground for animals\nwho were past work, was to be ploughed\nup. It was given out that the pasture was\nexhausted and needed re-seeding; but it\nsoon became known that ", "#$#$Chapter  9#$#$<br><br>B  oxer's\nsplit  hoof  was  a  long  time  in  healing.\nThey  had  started  the  rebuilding  of  the\nwindmill  the  day  after  the  victory\ncelebrations  were  ended.  Boxer  refused\nto take even a day off work, and made it\na point of honour not to let it be seen that\nhe was in pain. In the evenings he would\nadmit  privately  to  Clover  that  the  hoof\ntroubled him a great deal. Clover treated\nthe  hoof  with  poultices  of  herbs  which\nshe prepared by chewing them, and both\nshe  and<br><br>Benjamin  urged  Boxer\nto work less hard. \"A horse's lungs do not\nlast for ever,\" she said to him. But Boxer\nwould  not  listen.  He  had,  he  said,  only\none  real  ambition  left  -  to  see  the\nwindmill  well  under  way  before  he\nreached  the  age  for\nretirement.<br><br>At  the  beginning,\nwhen the laws of Animal Farm were first\nformulated,  the  retiring  age  had  been\nfixed  for  horses  and  pigs  at  twelve,  for\ncows  at  fourteen,  for  dogs  at  nine,  for\nsheep at seven, and for hens and geese\nat  five.  Liberal  old-age  pensions  had\nbeen agreed upon. As yet no animal had", "actually retired on pension, but of late the\nsubject  had  been  discussed  more  and\nmore.  Now  that  the  small  field  beyond\nthe  orchard  had  been  set  aside  for\nbarley,  it  was  rumoured  that  a  corner  of\nthe  large  pasture  was  to  be  fenced  off\nand  turned  into  a  grazing-ground  for\nsuperannuated  animals.  For  a  horse,  it\nwas  said,  the  pension  would  be  five\npounds  of  corn  a  day  and,  in  winter,\nfifteen  pounds  of  hay,  with  a  carrot  or\npossibly  an  apple  on  public\nholidays.<br><br>Boxer's twelfth birthday\nwas  due  in  the  late  summer  of  the\nfollowing  year.<br><br>Meanwhile  life\nwas hard. The winter was as cold as the\nlast  one  had  been,  and  food  was  even\nshorter.  Once  again  all  rations  were\nreduced, except those of the pigs and the\ndogs.  A  too  rigid  equality  in  rations,\nSquealer  explained,  would  have  been\ncontrary to the principles of Animalism. In\nany case he had no difficulty in proving to\nthe other animals that they were NOT in\nreality  short  of  food,  whatever  the\nappearances  might  be.  For  the  time\nbeing,  certainly,  it  had  been  found", "necessary  to  make  a  readjustment  of\nrations (Squealer always spoke of it as a\n\"readjustment,\"  never  as  a  \"reduction\"),\nbut in comparison with the days of Jones,\nthe  improvement  was  enormous.\nReading  out  the  figures  in  a  shrill,  rapid\nvoice,  he  proved  to  them  in  detail  that\nthey  had  more  oats,  more  hay,  more\nturnips than they had had in Jones's day,\nthat they worked shorter hours, that their\ndrinking  water  was  of  better  quality,  that\nthey lived longer, that a larger proportion\nof their young ones survived infancy, and\nthat  they  had  more  straw  in  their  stalls\nand suffered less from fleas. The animals\nbelieved  every  word  of  it.  Truth  to  tell,\nJones  and  all  he  stood  for  had  almost\nfaded  out  of  their\nmemories.<br><br>They  knew  that  life\nnowadays was harsh and bare, that they\nwere  often  hungry  and  often  cold,  and\nthat they were usually working when they\nwere  not  asleep.  But  doubtless  it  had\nbeen  worse  in  the  old  days.  They  were\nglad to believe so. Besides, in those days\nthey had been slaves and now they were\nfree, and that made all the difference, as", "Squealer  did  not  fail  to  point\nout.<br><br>There  were  many  more\nmouths  to  feed  now.  In  the  autumn  the\nfour  sows  had  all  littered  about\nsimultaneously,  producing  thirty-one\nyoung  pigs  between  them.  The  young\npigs  were  piebald,  and\nas<br><br>Napoleon  was  the  only  boar\non  the  farm,  it  was  possible  to  guess  at\ntheir  parentage.  It  was  announced  that\nlater,  when  bricks  and  timber  had  been\npurchased,  a  schoolroom  would  be  built\nin  the  farmhouse  garden.  For  the  time\nbeing,  the  young  pigs  were  given  their\ninstruction  by  Napoleon  himself  in  the\nfarmhouse  kitchen.  They  took  their\nexercise  in  the  garden,  and  were\ndiscouraged  from  playing  with  the  other\nyoung  animals.  About  this  time,  too,  it\nwas laid down as a rule that when a pig\nand  any  other  animal  met  on  the  path,\nthe  other  animal  must  stand  aside:  and\nalso  that  all  pigs,  of  whatever  degree,\nwere  to  have  the  privilege  of  wearing\ngreen  ribbons  on  their  tails  on\nSundays.<br><br>The  farm  had  had  a\nfairly  successful  year,  but  was  still  short", "of  money.  There  were  the  bricks,  sand,\nand  lime  for  the  schoolroom  to  be\npurchased,  and  it  would  also  be\nnecessary  to  begin  saving  up  again  for\nthe  machinery  for  the  windmill.  Then\nthere  were  lamp  oil  and  candles  for  the\nhouse,  sugar  for  Napoleon's  own  table\n(he forbade this to the other pigs, on the\nground that it made them fat), and all the\nusual  replacements  such  as  tools,  nails,\nstring,  coal,  wire,  scrap-iron,  and  dog\nbiscuits.  A  stump  of  hay  and  part  of  the\npotato  crop  were  sold  off,  and  the\ncontract  for  eggs  was  increased  to  six\nhundred  a  week,  so  that  that  year  the\nhens  barely  hatched  enough  chicks  to\nkeep  their  numbers  at  the  same  level.\nRations,  reduced  in  December,  were\nreduced  again  in<br><br>February,  and\nlanterns  in  the  stalls  were  forbidden  to\nsave  oil.  But  the  pigs  seemed\ncomfortable  enough,  and  in  fact  were\nputting  on  weight  if  anything.  One\nafternoon  in  late  February  a  warm,  rich,\nappetising  scent,  such  as  the  animals\nhad  never  smelt  before,  wafted  itself\nacross  the  yard  from  the  little", "brew-house,  which  had  been  disused  in\nJones's  time,  and  which  stood  beyond\nthe  kitchen.  Someone  said  it  was  the\nsmell  of  cooking  barley.  The  animals\nsniffed  the  air  hungrily  and  wondered\nwhether  a  warm  mash  was  being\nprepared for their supper.<br><br>But no\nwarm  mash  appeared,  and  on  the\nfollowing  Sunday  it  was  announced  that\nfrom  now  onwards  all  barley  would  be\nreserved  for  the  pigs.  The  field  beyond\nthe  orchard  had  already  been  sown  with\nbarley.<br><br>And  the  news  soon\nleaked  out  that  every  pig  was  now\nreceiving  a  ration  of  a  pint  of  beer  daily,\nwith  half  a  gallon  for  Napoleon  himself,\nwhich  was  always  served  to  him  in  the\nCrown Derby soup tureen.<br><br>But if\nthere  were  hardships  to  be  borne,  they\nwere  partly  offset  by  the  fact  that  life\nnowadays  had  a  greater  dignity  than  it\nhad  had  before.<br><br>There  were\nmore  songs,  more  speeches,  more\nprocessions.  Napoleon  had  commanded\nthat  once  a  week  there  should  be  held\nsomething  called  a  Spontaneous\nDemonstration,  the  object  of  which  was", "to  celebrate  the  struggles  and  triumphs\nof  Animal  Farm.  At  the  appointed  time\nthe  animals  would  leave  their  work  and\nmarch round the precincts of the farm in\nmilitary  formation,  with  the  pigs  leading,\nthen the horses, then the cows, then the\nsheep,  and  then  the  poultry.  The  dogs\nflanked the procession and at the head of\nall  marched  Napoleon's  black  cockerel.\nBoxer  and  Clover  always  carried\nbetween  them  a  green  banner  marked\nwith  the  hoof  and  the  horn  and  the\ncaption,  \"Long  live<br><br>Comrade\nNapoleon!\"  Afterwards  there  were\nrecitations  of  poems  composed  in\nNapoleon's  honour,  and  a  speech  by\nSquealer  giving  particulars  of  the  latest\nincreases in the production of foodstuffs,\nand  on  occasion  a  shot  was  fired  from\nthe  gun.  The  sheep  were  the  greatest\ndevotees  of  the  Spontaneous\nDemonstration,  and  if  anyone\ncomplained (as a few animals sometimes\ndid,  when  no  pigs  or  dogs  were  near)\nthat they wasted time and meant a lot of\nstanding  about  in  the  cold,  the  sheep\nwere  sure  to  silence  him  with  a", "tremendous  bleating  of  \"Four  legs  good,\ntwo  legs  bad!\"  But  by  and  large  the\nanimals  enjoyed  these  celebrations.\nThey  found  it  comforting  to  be  reminded\nthat,  after  all,  they  were  truly  their  own\nmasters  and  that  the  work  they  did  was\nfor  their  own  benefit.  So  that,  what  with\nthe  songs,  the  processions,  Squealer's\nlists  of  figures,  the  thunder  of  the  gun,\nthe  crowing  of  the  cockerel,  and  the\nfluttering  of  the  flag,  they  were  able  to\nforget  that  their  bellies  were  empty,  at\nleast  part  of  the  time.<br><br>In  April,\nAnimal Farm was proclaimed a Republic,\nand  it  became  necessary  to  elect  a\nPresident.  There  was  only  one\ncandidate,<br><br>Napoleon,  who  was\nelected unanimously. On the same day it\nwas  given  out  that  fresh  documents  had\nbeen  discovered  which  revealed  further\ndetails  about  Snowball's  complicity  with\nJones.  It  now  appeared\nthat<br><br>Snowball  had  not,  as  the\nanimals had previously imagined, merely\nattempted  to  lose  the  Battle  of  the\nCowshed  by  means  of  a  stratagem,  but\nhad been openly fighting on Jones's side.", "In  fact,  it  was  he  who  had  actually  been\nthe leader of the human forces, and had\ncharged  into  battle  with  the  words  \"Long\nlive  Humanity!\"  on  his  lips.  The  wounds\non  Snowball's  back,  which  a  few  of  the\nanimals  still  remembered  to  have  seen,\nhad  been  inflicted  by  Napoleon's\nteeth.<br><br>In  the  middle  of  the\nsummer  Moses  the  raven  suddenly\nreappeared  on  the  farm,  after  an\nabsence  of  several  years.  He  was  quite\nunchanged,  still  did  no  work,  and  talked\nin  the  same  strain  as  ever  about\nSugarcandy  Mountain.  He  would  perch\non a stump, flap his black wings, and talk\nby  the  hour  to  anyone  who  would  listen.\n\"Up  there,  comrades,\"  he  would  say\nsolemnly,  pointing  to  the  sky  with  his\nlarge  beak  -\"up  there,  just  on  the  other\nside of that dark cloud that you can see -\nthere  it  lies,  Sugarcandy  Mountain,  that\nhappy  country  where  we  poor  animals\nshall  rest  for  ever  from  our  labours!\"  He\neven claimed to have been there on one\nof his higher flights, and to have seen the\neverlasting  fields  of  clover  and  the\nlinseed cake and lump sugar growing on", "the  hedges.  Many  of  the  animals\nbelieved  him.  Their  lives  now,  they\nreasoned,  were  hungry  and  laborious;\nwas  it  not  right  and  just  that  a  better\nworld  should  exist  somewhere  else?  A\nthing  that  was  difficult  to  determine  was\nthe  attitude  of  the  pigs  towards\nMoses.<br><br>They  all  declared\ncontemptuously  that  his  stories  about\nSugarcandy<br><br>Mountain  were  lies,\nand  yet  they  allowed  him  to  remain  on\nthe farm, not working, with an allowance\nof  a  gill  of  beer  a  day.<br><br>After  his\nhoof  had  healed  up,  Boxer  worked\nharder than ever.<br><br>Indeed, all the\nanimals  worked  like  slaves  that  year.\nApart  from  the  regular  work  of  the  farm,\nand  the  rebuilding  of  the  windmill,  there\nwas the schoolhouse for the young pigs,\nwhich  was  started  in\nMarch.<br><br>Sometimes  the  long\nhours  on  insufficient  food  were  hard  to\nbear,  but<br><br>Boxer  never  faltered.\nIn  nothing  that  he  said  or  did  was  there\nany sign that his strength was not what it\nhad  been.  It  was  only  his  appearance\nthat was a little altered; his hide was less", "shiny  than  it  had  used  to  be,  and  his\ngreat  haunches  seemed  to  have\nshrunken.  The  others  said,  \"Boxer  will\npick  up  when  the  spring  grass  comes\non\"; but the spring came and Boxer grew\nno  fatter.  Sometimes  on  the  slope\nleading to the top of the quarry, when he\nbraced his muscles against the weight of\nsome  vast  boulder,  it  seemed  that\nnothing  kept  him  on  his  feet  except  the\nwill  to  continue.  At  such  times  his  lips\nwere seen to form the words, \"I will work\nharder\"; he had no voice left. Once again\nClover  and<br><br>Benjamin  warned\nhim to take care of his health, but Boxer\npaid  no  attention.  His  twelfth  birthday\nwas  approaching.  He  did  not  care  what\nhappened  so  long  as  a  good  store  of\nstone  was  accumulated  before  he  went\non pension.<br><br>Late one evening in\nthe summer, a sudden rumour ran round\nthe farm that something had happened to\nBoxer.  He  had  gone  out  alone  to  drag  a\nload  of  stone  down  to  the  windmill.  And\nsure enough, the rumour was true. A few\nminutes later two pigeons came racing in\nwith  the  news;  \"Boxer  has  fallen!  He  is", "lying  on  his  side  and  can't  get\nup!\"<br><br>About  half  the  animals  on\nthe  farm  rushed  out  to  the  knoll  where\nthe  windmill  stood.  There  lay  Boxer,\nbetween  the  shafts  of  the  cart,  his  neck\nstretched  out,  unable  even  to  raise  his\nhead.  His  eyes  were  glazed,  his  sides\nmatted with sweat. A thin stream of blood\nhad  trickled  out  of  his  mouth.  Clover\ndropped  to  her  knees  at  his  side.\n\"Boxer!\"  she  cried,  \"how  are  you?\"  \"It  is\nmy lung,\" said Boxer in a weak voice. \"It\ndoes  not  matter.  I  think  you  will  be  able\nto finish the windmill without me. There is\na  pretty  good  store  of  stone\naccumulated.  I  had  only  another  month\nto go in any case. To tell you the truth, I\nhad  been  looking  forward  to  my\nretirement.  And  perhaps,  as  Benjamin  is\ngrowing old too, they will let him retire at\nthe  same  time  and  be  a  companion  to\nme.\"  \"We  must  get  help  at  once,\"  said\nClover.  \"Run,  somebody,  and\ntell<br><br>Squealer  what  has\nhappened.\"<br><br>All the other animals\nimmediately raced back to the farmhouse\nto  give  Squealer  the  news.  Only  Clover", "remained, and Benjamin who lay down at\nBoxer's side, and, without speaking, kept\nthe  flies  off  him  with  his  long  tail.  After\nabout  a  quarter  of  an  hour  Squealer\nappeared,  full  of  sympathy  and  concern.\nHe  said  that  Comrade  Napoleon  had\nlearned with the very deepest distress of\nthis  misfortune  to  one  of  the  most  loyal\nworkers  on  the  farm,  and  was  already\nmaking  arrangements  to  send  Boxer  to\nbe  treated  in  the  hospital  at  Willingdon.\nThe  animals  felt  a  little  uneasy  at  this.\nExcept for Mollie and Snowball, no other\nanimal  had  ever  left  the  farm,  and  they\ndid not like to think of their sick comrade\nin the hands of human beings. However,\nSquealer  easily  convinced  them  that  the\nveterinary  surgeon  in  Willingdon  could\ntreat<br><br>Boxer's  case  more\nsatisfactorily  than  could  be  done  on  the\nfarm. And about half an hour later, when\nBoxer  had  somewhat  recovered,  he  was\nwith  difficulty  got  on  to  his  feet,  and\nmanaged to limp back to his stall, where\nClover  and  Benjamin  had  prepared  a\ngood  bed  of  straw  for  him.<br><br>For\nthe next two days Boxer remained in his", "stall. The pigs had sent out a large bottle\nof pink medicine which they had found in\nthe medicine chest in the bathroom, and\nClover  administered  it  to  Boxer  twice  a\nday  after  meals.  In  the  evenings  she  lay\nin  his  stall  and  talked  to  him,  while\nBenjamin  kept  the  flies  off  him.  Boxer\nprofessed  not  to  be  sorry  for  what  had\nhappened.  If  he  made  a  good  recovery,\nhe  might  expect  to  live  another  three\nyears,  and  he  looked  forward  to  the\npeaceful days that he would spend in the\ncorner of the big pasture. It would be the\nfirst time that he had had leisure to study\nand  improve  his  mind.  He  intended,  he\nsaid,  to  devote  the  rest  of  his  life  to\nlearning  the  remaining  twenty-two  letters\nof  the  alphabet.<br><br>However,\nBenjamin  and  Clover  could  only  be  with\nBoxer  after  working  hours,  and  it  was  in\nthe middle of the day when the van came\nto take him away. The animals were all at\nwork  weeding  turnips  under  the\nsupervision  of  a  pig,  when  they  were\nastonished  to  see  Benjamin  come\ngalloping  from  the  direction  of  the  farm\nbuildings, braying at the top of his voice.", "It  was  the  first  time  that  they  had  ever\nseen  Benjamin  excited  -  indeed,  it  was\nthe  first  time  that  anyone  had  ever  seen\nhim  gallop.  \"Quick,  quick!\"  he  shouted.\n\"Come  at  once!  They're\ntaking<br><br>Boxer  away!\"  Without\nwaiting  for  orders  from  the  pig,  the\nanimals broke off work and raced back to\nthe farm buildings. Sure enough, there in\nthe  yard  was  a  large  closed  van,  drawn\nby  two  horses,  with  lettering  on  its  side\nand  a  sly-looking  man  in  a  low-crowned\nbowler  hat  sitting  on  the  driver's  seat.\nAnd  Boxer's  stall  was\nempty.<br><br>The  animals  crowded\nround  the  van.  \"Good-bye,  Boxer!\"  they\nchorused,  \"good-bye!\"  \"Fools!  Fools!\"\nshouted  Benjamin,  prancing  round  them\nand  stamping  the  earth  with  his  small\nhoofs.  \"Fools!  Do  you  not  see  what  is\nwritten  on  the  side  of  that\nvan?\"<br><br>That  gave  the  animals\npause,  and  there  was  a  hush.  Muriel\nbegan  to  spell  out  the  words.  But\nBenjamin  pushed  her  aside  and  in  the\nmidst of a deadly silence he read: \"'Alfred\nSimmonds,  Horse  Slaughterer  and  Glue", "Boiler,<br><br>Willingdon.  Dealer  in\nHides  and  Bone-Meal.  Kennels\nSupplied.'  Do  you  not  understand  what\nthat means? They are taking Boxer to the\nknacker's!\"<br><br>A  cry  of  horror  burst\nfrom  all  the  animals.  At  this  moment  the\nman  on  the  box  whipped  up  his  horses\nand  the  van  moved  out  of  the  yard  at  a\nsmart  trot.  All  the  animals  followed,\ncrying  out  at  the  tops  of  their  voices.\nClover  forced  her  way  to  the  front.  The\nvan  began  to  gather  speed.  Clover  tried\nto  stir  her  stout  limbs  to  a  gallop,  and\nachieved  a  canter.  \"Boxer!\"  she  cried.\n\"Boxer!  Boxer!  Boxer!\"  And  just  at  this\nmoment,  as  though  he  had  heard  the\nuproar  outside,  Boxer's  face,  with  the\nwhite  stripe  down  his  nose,  appeared  at\nthe small window at the back of the van.\n\"Boxer!\"  cried  Clover  in  a  terrible  voice.\n\"Boxer! Get out! Get out quickly! They're\ntaking you to your death!\"<br><br>All the\nanimals  took  up  the  cry  of  \"Get  out,\nBoxer, get out!\" But the van was already\ngathering  speed  and  drawing  away  from\nthem.  It  was  uncertain  whether  Boxer\nhad  understood  what  Clover  had  said.", "But a moment later his face disappeared\nfrom  the  window  and  there  was  the\nsound  of  a  tremendous  drumming  of\nhoofs  inside  the  van.  He  was  trying  to\nkick  his  way  out.  The  time  had  been\nwhen  a  few  kicks  from<br><br>Boxer's\nhoofs  would  have  smashed  the  van  to\nmatchwood.  But  alas!  his  strength  had\nleft him; and in a few moments the sound\nof drumming hoofs grew fainter and died\naway.  In  desperation  the  animals  began\nappealing  to  the  two  horses  which  drew\nthe  van  to  stop.  \"Comrades,  comrades!\"\nthey  shouted.  \"Don't  take  your  own\nbrother  to  his  death!  \"But  the  stupid\nbrutes,  too  ignorant  to  realise  what  was\nhappening,  merely  set  back  their  ears\nand  quickened  their  pace.  Boxer's  face\ndid not reappear at the window. Too late,\nsomeone  thought  of  racing  ahead  and\nshutting  the  five-barred  gate;  but  in\nanother  moment  the  van  was  through  it\nand  rapidly  disappearing  down  the  road.\nBoxer  was  never  seen\nagain.<br><br>Three  days  later  it  was\nannounced  that  he  had  died  in  the\nhospital  at  Willingdon,  in  spite  of", "receiving  every  attention  a  horse  could\nhave.<br><br>Squealer  came  to\nannounce  the  news  to  the  others.  He\nhad,  he  said,  been  present  during\nBoxer's  last  hours.  \"It  was  the  most\naffecting  sight  I  have  ever  seen!\"  said\nSquealer,  lifting  his  trotter  and  wiping\naway a tear. \"I was at his bedside at the\nvery  last.  And  at  the  end,  almost  too\nweak  to  speak,  he  whispered  in  my  ear\nthat his sole sorrow was to have passed\non  before  the  windmill  was  finished.\n'Forward,  comrades!'  he  whispered.\n'Forward  in  the  name  of  the  Rebellion.\nLong  live  Animal  Farm!  Long  live\nComrade Napoleon!<br><br>Napoleon is\nalways  right.'  Those  were  his  very  last\nwords,  comrades.\"<br><br>Here\nSquealer's  demeanour  suddenly\nchanged. He fell silent for a moment, and\nhis  little  eyes  darted  suspicious  glances\nfrom  side  to  side  before  he\nproceeded.<br><br>It  had  come  to  his\nknowledge,  he  said,  that  a  foolish  and\nwicked rumour had been circulated at the\ntime  of  Boxer's  removal.  Some  of  the\nanimals  had  noticed  that  the  van  which", "took  Boxer  away  was  marked  \"Horse\nSlaughterer,\" and had actually jumped to\nthe conclusion that Boxer was being sent\nto  the  knacker's.  It  was  almost\nunbelievable,  said  Squealer,  that  any\nanimal  could  be  so  stupid.  Surely,  he\ncried  indignantly,  whisking  his  tail  and\nskipping  from  side  to  side,  surely  they\nknew  their  beloved  Leader,  Comrade\nNapoleon,  better  than  that?  But  the\nexplanation  was  really  very  simple.  The\nvan  had  previously  been  the  property  of\nthe knacker, and had been bought by the\nveterinary  surgeon,  who  had  not  yet\npainted the old name out. That was how\nthe  mistake  had  arisen.<br><br>The\nanimals  were  enormously  relieved  to\nhear  this.  And  when<br><br>Squealer\nwent on to give further graphic details of\nBoxer's death-bed, the admirable care he\nhad  received,  and  the  expensive\nmedicines  for  which  Napoleon  had  paid\nwithout a thought as to the cost, their last\ndoubts  disappeared  and  the  sorrow  that\nthey  felt  for  their  comrade's  death  was\ntempered by the thought that at least he\nhad  died  happy.<br><br>Napoleon", "himself  appeared  at  the  meeting  on  the\nfollowing<br><br>Sunday  morning  and\npronounced  a  short  oration  in  Boxer's\nhonour. It had not been possible, he said,\nto  bring  back  their  lamented  comrade's\nremains for interment on the farm, but he\nhad  ordered  a  large  wreath  to  be  made\nfrom the laurels in the farmhouse garden\nand  sent  down  to  be  placed  on  Boxer's\ngrave.  And  in  a  few  days'  time  the  pigs\nintended  to  hold  a  memorial  banquet  in\nBoxer's  honour.  Napoleon  ended  his\nspeech  with  a  reminder  of  Boxer's  two\nfavourite maxims, \"I will work harder\" and\n\"Comrade  Napoleon  is  always  right\"-\nmaxims,  he  said,  which  every  animal\nwould  do  well  to  adopt  as  his\nown.<br><br>On  the  day  appointed  for\nthe  banquet,  a  grocer's  van  drove  up\nfrom  Willingdon  and  delivered  a  large\nwooden  crate  at  the\nfarmhouse.<br><br>That night there was\nthe  sound  of  uproarious  singing,  which\nwas  followed  by  what  sounded  like  a\nviolent quarrel and ended at about ", "#$#$Chapter  10#$#$<br><br>Y  ears\npassed.  The  seasons  came  and  went,\nthe  short  animal  lives  fled  by.  A  time\ncame  when  there  was  no  one  who\nremembered  the  old  days  before  the\nRebellion,  except  Clover,\nBenjamin,<br><br>Moses the raven, and\na number of the pigs.<br><br>Muriel was\ndead; Bluebell, Jessie, and Pincher were\ndead. Jones too was dead - he had died\nin  an  inebriates'  home  in  another  part  of\nthe  country.  Snowball  was  forgotten.\nBoxer  was  forgotten,  except  by  the  few\nwho  had  known  him.  Clover  was  an  old\nstout mare now, stiff in the joints and with\na tendency to rheumy eyes. She was two\nyears past the retiring age, but in fact no\nanimal had ever actually retired. The talk\nof  setting  aside  a  corner  of  the  pasture\nfor  superannuated  animals  had  long\nsince  been  dropped.  Napoleon  was  now\na  mature  boar  of  twenty-four  stone.\nSquealer  was  so  fat  that  he  could  with\ndifficulty  see  out  of  his  eyes.  Only  old\nBenjamin  was  much  the  same  as  ever,\nexcept  for  being  a  little  greyer  about  the\nmuzzle,  and,  since  Boxer's  death,  more", "morose  and  taciturn  than\never.<br><br>There  were  many  more\ncreatures  on  the  farm  now,  though  the\nincrease  was  not  so  great  as  had  been\nexpected  in  earlier  years.  Many  animals\nhad  been  born  to  whom  the  Rebellion\nwas  only  a  dim  tradition,  passed  on  by\nword  of  mouth,  and  others  had  been\nbought  who  had  never  heard  mention  of\nsuch a thing before their arrival. The farm\npossessed  three  horses  now  besides\nClover.  They  were  fine  upstanding\nbeasts,  willing  workers  and  good\ncomrades, but very stupid. None of them\nproved able to learn the alphabet beyond\nthe  letter  B.  They  accepted  everything\nthat  they  were  told  about\nthe<br><br>Rebellion  and  the  principles\nof  Animalism,  especially  from  Clover,  for\nwhom  they  had  an  almost  filial  respect;\nbut  it  was  doubtful  whether  they\nunderstood  very  much  of  it.  The  farm\nwas  more  prosperous  now,  and  better\norganised: it had even been enlarged by\ntwo  fields  which  had  been  bought  from\nMr.<br><br>Pilkington.  The  windmill  had\nbeen successfully completed at last, and", "the farm possessed a threshing machine\nand  a  hay  elevator  of  its  own,  and\nvarious new buildings had been added to\nit.  Whymper  had  bought  himself  a\ndogcart.  The  windmill,  however,  had  not\nafter  all  been  used  for  generating\nelectrical  power.  It  was  used  for  milling\ncorn, and brought in a handsome money\nprofit.  The  animals  were  hard  at  work\nbuilding  yet  another  windmill;  when  that\none  was  finished,  so  it  was  said,  the\ndynamos  would  be  installed.  But  the\nluxuries  of  which<br><br>Snowball  had\nonce  taught  the  animals  to  dream,  the\nstalls  with  electric  light  and  hot  and  cold\nwater,  and  the  three-day  week,  were  no\nlonger  talked  about.  Napoleon  had\ndenounced such ideas as contrary to the\nspirit of Animalism. The truest happiness,\nhe  said,  lay  in  working  hard  and  living\nfrugally.<br><br>Somehow  it  seemed  as\nthough the farm had grown richer without\nmaking  the  animals  themselves  any\nricher-except, of course, for the pigs and\nthe  dogs.  Perhaps  this  was  partly\nbecause there were so many pigs and so\nmany  dogs.  It  was  not  that  these", "creatures  did  not  work,  after  their\nfashion.  There  was,  as  Squealer  was\nnever tired of explaining, endless work in\nthe  supervision  and  organisation  of  the\nfarm.  Much  of  this  work  was  of  a  kind\nthat  the  other  animals  were  too  ignorant\nto  understand.  For  example,  Squealer\ntold  them  that  the  pigs  had  to  expend\nenormous  labours  every  day  upon\nmysterious things called \"files,\" \"reports,\"\n\"minutes,\"  and  \"memoranda\".  These\nwere large sheets of paper which had to\nbe  closely  covered  with  writing,  and  as\nsoon as they were so covered, they were\nburnt  in  the  furnace.  This  was  of  the\nhighest importance for the welfare of the\nfarm, Squealer said. But still, neither pigs\nnor dogs produced any food by their own\nlabour;  and  there  were  very  many  of\nthem,  and  their  appetites  were  always\ngood.  As  for  the  others,  their  life,  so  far\nas they knew, was as it had always been.\nThey  were  generally  hungry,  they  slept\non  straw,  they  drank  from  the  pool,  they\nlaboured in the fields; in winter they were\ntroubled  by  the  cold,  and  in  summer  by\nthe  flies.  Sometimes  the  older  ones", "among  them  racked  their  dim  memories\nand  tried  to  determine  whether  in  the\nearly days of the Rebellion, when Jones's\nexpulsion  was  still  recent,  things  had\nbeen  better  or  worse  than  now.  They\ncould  not  remember.  There  was  nothing\nwith  which  they  could  compare  their\npresent  lives:  they  had  nothing  to  go\nupon  except  Squealer's  lists  of  figures,\nwhich  invariably  demonstrated  that\neverything  was  getting  better  and  better.\nThe animals found the problem insoluble;\nin  any  case,  they  had  little  time  for\nspeculating  on  such  things  now.  Only\nold<br><br>Benjamin  professed  to\nremember every detail of his long life and\nto  know  that  things  never  had  been,  nor\never  could  be  much  better  or  much\nworse  -  hunger,  hardship,  and\ndisappointment  being,  so  he  said,  the\nunalterable  law  of  life.<br><br>And  yet\nthe  animals  never  gave  up  hope.  More,\nthey never lost, even for an instant, their\nsense  of  honour  and  privilege  in  being\nmembers of Animal Farm. They were still\nthe only farm in the whole county - in all\nEngland!  -  owned  and  operated  by", "animals.  Not  one  of  them,  not  even  the\nyoungest,  not  even  the  newcomers  who\nhad  been  brought  from  farms  ten  or\ntwenty  miles  away,  ever  ceased  to\nmarvel at that. And when they heard the\ngun  booming  and  saw  the  green  flag\nfluttering  at  the  masthead,  their  hearts\nswelled  with  imperishable  pride,  and  the\ntalk turned always towards the old heroic\ndays,  the  expulsion  of  Jones,  the  writing\nof  the  Seven  Commandments,  the  great\nbattles in which the human invaders had\nbeen  defeated.  None  of  the  old  dreams\nhad  been  abandoned.  The  Republic  of\nthe  Animals  which<br><br>Major  had\nforetold,  when  the  green  fields  of\nEngland  should  be  untrodden  by  human\nfeet,  was  still  believed  in.  Some  day  it\nwas coming: it might not be soon, it might\nnot  be  with  in  the  lifetime  of  any  animal\nnow  living,  but  still  it  was  coming.  Even\nthe  tune  of  'Beasts  of  England'  was\nperhaps  hummed  secretly  here  and\nthere: at any rate, it was a fact that every\nanimal  on  the  farm  knew  it,  though  no\none would have dared to sing it aloud. It\nmight  be  that  their  lives  were  hard  and", "that  not  all  of  their  hopes  had  been\nfulfilled;  but  they  were  conscious  that\nthey  were  not  as  other  animals.  If  they\nwent  hungry,  it  was  not  from  feeding\ntyrannical  human  beings;  if  they  worked\nhard,  at  least  they  worked  for\nthemselves.  No  creature  among  them\nwent  upon  two  legs.  No  creature  called\nany  other  creature  \"Master.\"  All  animals\nwere  equal.<br><br>One  day  in  early\nsummer  Squealer  ordered  the  sheep  to\nfollow him, and led them out to a piece of\nwaste  ground  at  the  other  end  of  the\nfarm, which had become overgrown with\nbirch  saplings.  The  sheep  spent  the\nwhole  day  there  browsing  at  the  leaves\nunder  Squealer's  supervision.  In  the\nevening  he  returned  to  the  farmhouse\nhimself, but, as it was warm weather, told\nthe  sheep  to  stay  where  they  were.  It\nended  by  their  remaining  there  for  a\nwhole week, during which time the other\nanimals  saw  nothing  of  them.  Squealer\nwas  with  them  for  the  greater  part  of\nevery  day.  He  was,  he  said,  teaching\nthem  to  sing  a  new  song,  for  which\nprivacy  was  needed.<br><br>It  was  just", "after  the  sheep  had  returned,  on  a\npleasant  evening  when  the  animals  had\nfinished work and were making their way\nback  to  the  farm  buildings,  that  the\nterrified  neighing  of  a  horse  sounded\nfrom  the  yard.  Startled,  the  animals\nstopped  in  their  tracks.  It\nwas<br><br>Clover's voice. She neighed\nagain,  and  all  the  animals  broke  into  a\ngallop  and  rushed  into  the  yard.  Then\nthey  saw  what  Clover  had\nseen.<br><br>It was a pig walking on his\nhind  legs.<br><br>Yes,  it  was  Squealer.\nA  little  awkwardly,  as  though  not  quite\nused  to  supporting  his  considerable  bulk\nin that position, but with perfect balance,\nhe  was  strolling  across  the  yard.  And  a\nmoment  later,  out  from  the  door  of  the\nfarmhouse  came  a  long  file  of  pigs,  all\nwalking  on  their  hind  legs.  Some  did  it\nbetter than others, one or two were even\na  trifle  unsteady  and  looked  as  though\nthey  would  have  liked  the  support  of  a\nstick,  but  every  one  of  them  made  his\nway  right  round  the  yard  successfully.\nAnd  finally  there  was  a  tremendous\nbaying  of  dogs  and  a  shrill  crowing  from", "the  black  cockerel,  and  out  came\nNapoleon  himself,  majestically  upright,\ncasting  haughty  glances  from  side  to\nside, and with his dogs gambolling round\nhim.<br><br>He  carried  a  whip  in  his\ntrotter.<br><br>There  was  a  deadly\nsilence.  Amazed,  terrified,  huddling\ntogether,  the  animals  watched  the  long\nline  of  pigs  march  slowly  round  the\nyard.<br><br>It was as though the world\nhad  turned  upside-down.  Then  there\ncame a moment when the first shock had\nworn  off  and  when,  in  spite  of\neverything-in  spite  of  their  terror  of  the\ndogs,  and  of  the  habit,  developed\nthrough long years, of never complaining,\nnever  criticising,  no  matter  what\nhappened  -  they  might  have  uttered\nsome  word  of  protest.  But  just  at  that\nmoment,  as  though  at  a  signal,  all  the\nsheep  burst  out  into  a  tremendous\nbleating  of  -  \"Four  legs  good,  two  legs\nBETTER!  Four  legs  good,  two\nlegs<br><br>BETTER!  Four  legs  good,\ntwo  legs  BETTER!\"<br><br>It  went  on\nfor five minutes without stopping. And by\nthe time the sheep had quieted down, the", "chance  to  utter  any  protest  had  passed,\nfor  the  pigs  had  marched  back  into  the\nfarmhouse.<br><br>Benjamin felt a nose\nnuzzling  at  his  shoulder.  He  looked\nround. It was Clover. Her old eyes looked\ndimmer  than  ever.  Without  saying\nanything,  she  tugged  gently  at  his  mane\nand  led  him  round  to  the  end  of  the  big\nbarn,  where  the  Seven  Commandments\nwere  written.  For  a  minute  or  two  they\nstood  gazing  at  the  tatted  wall  with  its\nwhite  lettering.  \"My  sight  is  failing,\"  she\nsaid  finally.  \"Even  when  I  was  young  I\ncould  not  have  read  what  was  written\nthere. But it appears to me that that wall\nlooks  different.  Are  the  Seven\nCommandments  the  same  as  they  used\nto  be,  Benjamin?\"<br><br>For  once\nBenjamin  consented  to  break  his  rule,\nand  he  read  out  to  her  what  was  written\non the wall. There was nothing there now\nexcept  a  single  Commandment.  It\nran:<br><br>ALL  ANIMALS  ARE\nEQUAL<br><br>BUT  SOME  ANIMALS\nARE  MORE  EQUAL  THAN\nOTHERS<br><br>After  that  it  did  not\nseem  strange  when  next  day  the  pigs", "who  were  supervising  the  work  of  the\nfarm  all  carried  whips  in  their  trotters.  It\ndid  not  seem  strange  to  learn  that  the\npigs  had  bought  themselves  a  wireless\nset, were arranging to install a telephone,\nand had taken out subscriptions to 'John\nBull', 'Tit-Bits', and the 'Daily Mirror'. It did\nnot  seem  strange  when  Napoleon  was\nseen  strolling  in  the  farmhouse  garden\nwith  a  pipe  in  his  mouth  -  no,  not  even\nwhen  the  pigs  took  Mr.<br><br>Jones's\nclothes  out  of  the  wardrobes  and  put\nthem  on,  Napoleon  himself  appearing  in\na  black  coat,  ratcatcher  breeches,  and\nleather  leggings,  while  his  favourite  sow\nappeared in the watered silk dress which\nMrs. Jones had been used to wearing on\nSundays.<br><br>A  week  later,  in  the\nafternoon,  a  number  of  dog-carts  drove\nup  to  the  farm.  A  deputation  of\nneighbouring farmers had been invited to\nmake  a  tour  of  inspection.  They  were\nshown  all  over  the  farm,  and  expressed\ngreat admiration for everything they saw,\nespecially the windmill. The animals were\nweeding  the  turnip  field.  They  worked\ndiligently  hardly  raising  their  faces  from", "the  ground,  and  not  knowing  whether  to\nbe  more  frightened  of  the  pigs  or  of  the\nhuman  visitors.<br><br>That  evening\nloud laughter and bursts of singing came\nfrom the farmhouse. And suddenly, at the\nsound of the mingled voices, the animals\nwere  stricken  with  curiosity.  What  could\nbe  happening  in  there,  now  that  for  the\nfirst  time  animals  and  human  beings\nwere meeting on terms of equality? With\none  accord  they  began  to  creep  as\nquietly  as  possible  into  the  farmhouse\ngarden.  At  the  gate  they  paused,  half\nfrightened  to  go  on  but  Clover  led  the\nway in. They tiptoed up to the house, and\nsuch animals as were tall enough peered\nin  at  the  dining-room  window.  There,\nround  the  long  table,  sat  half  a  dozen\nfarmers  and  half  a  dozen  of  the  more\neminent  pigs,  Napoleon  himself\noccupying the seat of honour at the head\nof  the  table.  The  pigs  appeared\ncompletely  at  ease  in  their  chairs.  The\ncompany  had  been  enjoying  a  game  of\ncards but had broken off for the moment,\nevidently in order to drink a toast. A large\njug  was  circulating,  and  the  mugs  were", "being  refilled  with  beer.  No  one  noticed\nthe  wondering  faces  of  the  animals  that\ngazed  in  at  the  window.<br><br>Mr.\nPilkington, of Foxwood, had stood up, his\nmug  in  his  hand.  In  a  moment,  he  said,\nhe  would  ask  the  present  company  to\ndrink  a  toast.<br><br>But  before  doing\nso, there were a few words that he felt it\nincumbent  upon  him  to  say.<br><br>It\nwas a source of great satisfaction to him,\nhe said - and, he was sure, to all others\npresent  -  to  feel  that  a  long  period  of\nmistrust  and  misunderstanding  had  now\ncome to an end. There had been a time -\nnot  that  he,  or  any  of  the  present\ncompany,  had  shared  such  sentiments  -\nbut  there  had  been  a  time  when  the\nrespected  proprietors  of  Animal  Farm\nhad  been  regarded,  he  would  not  say\nwith  hostility,  but  perhaps  with  a  certain\nmeasure  of  misgiving,  by  their  human\nneighbours.  Unfortunate  incidents  had\noccurred,  mistaken  ideas  had  been\ncurrent.  It  had  been  felt  that  the\nexistence of a farm owned and operated\nby pigs was somehow abnormal and was\nliable  to  have  an  unsettling  effect  in  the", "neighbourhood.  Too  many  farmers  had\nassumed,  without  due  enquiry,  that  on\nsuch  a  farm  a  spirit  of  licence  and\nindiscipline would prevail. They had been\nnervous about the effects upon their own\nanimals,  or  even  upon  their  human\nemployees.<br><br>But  all  such  doubts\nwere  now  dispelled.  Today  he  and  his\nfriends  had  visited  Animal  Farm  and\ninspected  every  inch  of  it  with  their  own\neyes,  and  what  did  they  find?  Not  only\nthe  most  up-to-date  methods,  but  a\ndiscipline  and  an  orderliness  which\nshould  be  an  example  to  all  farmers\neverywhere.  He  believed  that  he  was\nright  in  saying  that  the  lower  animals  on\nAnimal Farm did more work and received\nless food than any animals in the county.\nIndeed,  he  and  his  fellow-visitors  today\nhad  observed  many  features  which  they\nintended to introduce on their own farms\nimmediately.<br><br>He  would  end  his\nremarks,  he  said,  by  emphasising  once\nagain the friendly feelings that subsisted,\nand  ought  to  subsist,  between\nAnimal<br><br>Farm and its neighbours.\nBetween  pigs  and  human  beings  there", "was  not,  and  there  need  not  be,  any\nclash  of  interests  whatever.  Their\nstruggles  and  their  difficulties  were  one.\nWas  not  the  labour  problem  the  same\neverywhere?  Here  it  became  apparent\nthat  Mr.  Pilkington  was  about  to  spring\nsome  carefully  prepared  witticism  on  the\ncompany,  but  for  a  moment  he  was  too\novercome  by  amusement  to  be  able  to\nutter it. After much choking, during which\nhis  various  chins  turned  purple,  he\nmanaged  to  get  it  out:  \"If  you  have  your\nlower  animals  to  contend  with,\"  he  said,\n\"we  have  our  lower  classes!\"\nThis<br><br>BON MOT set the table in a\nroar;  and  Mr.  Pilkington  once  again\ncongratulated the pigs on the low rations,\nthe  long  working  hours,  and  the  general\nabsence  of  pampering  which  he  had\nobserved  on\nAnimal<br><br>Farm.<br><br>And  now,\nhe  said  finally,  he  would  ask  the\ncompany  to  rise  to  their  feet  and  make\ncertain  that  their  glasses  were  full.\n\"Gentlemen,\"  concluded  Mr.  Pilkington,\n\"gentlemen,  I  give  you  a  toast:  To  the\nprosperity  of  Animal", "Farm!\"<br><br>There  was  enthusiastic\ncheering and stamping of feet. Napoleon\nwas so gratified that he left his place and\ncame  round  the  table  to  clink  his  mug\nagainst  Mr.  Pilkington's  before  emptying\nit.  When  the  cheering  had  died  down,\nNapoleon, who had remained on his feet,\nintimated that he too had a few words to\nsay.<br><br>Like  all  of  Napoleon's\nspeeches,  it  was  short  and  to  the  point.\nHe  too,  he  said,  was  happy  that  the\nperiod  of  misunderstanding  was  at  an\nend.  For  a  long  time  there  had  been\nrumours  -  circulated,  he  had  reason  to\nthink,  by  some  malignant  enemy  -  that\nthere  was  something  subversive  and\neven  revolutionary  in  the  outlook  of\nhimself  and  his  colleagues.  They  had\nbeen  credited  with  attempting  to  stir  up\nrebellion  among  the  animals  on\nneighbouring  farms.  Nothing  could  be\nfurther  from  the  truth!  Their  sole  wish,\nnow and in the past, was to live at peace\nand  in  normal  business  relations  with\ntheir neighbours. This farm which he had\nthe  honour  to  control,  he  added,  was  a\nco-operative  enterprise.  The  title-deeds,", "which  were  in  his  own  possession,  were\nowned by the pigs jointly.<br><br>He did\nnot  believe,  he  said,  that  any  of  the  old\nsuspicions  still  lingered,  but  certain\nchanges  had  been  made  recently  in  the\nroutine of the farm which should have the\neffect  of  promoting  confidence  still\nfurther.  Hitherto  the  animals  on  the  farm\nhad  had  a  rather  foolish  custom  of\naddressing  one  another  as  \"Comrade.\"\nThis  was  to  be  suppressed.  There  had\nalso been a very strange custom, whose\norigin  was  unknown,  of  marching  every\nSunday morning past a boar's skull which\nwas nailed to a post in the garden. This,\ntoo,  would  be  suppressed,  and  the  skull\nhad  already  been  buried.  His  visitors\nmight have observed, too, the green flag\nwhich flew from the masthead. If so, they\nwould perhaps have noted that the white\nhoof  and  horn  with  which  it  had\npreviously  been  marked  had  now  been\nremoved.  It  would  be  a  plain  green  flag\nfrom  now  onwards.<br><br>He  had  only\none  criticism,  he  said,  to  make  of  Mr.\nPilkington's  excellent  and  neighbourly\nspeech.  Mr.  Pilkington  had  referred", "throughout  to  \"Animal  Farm.\"  He  could\nnot  of  course  know  -  for\nhe,<br><br>Napoleon,  was  only  now  for\nthe  first  time  announcing  it  -  that  the\nname  \"Animal  Farm\"  had  been\nabolished. Henceforward the farm was to\nbe  known  as  \"The  Manor  Farm\"-  which,\nhe  believed,  was  its  correct  and  original\nname.  \"Gentlemen,\"  concluded\nNapoleon, \"I will give you the same toast\nas before, but in a different form. Fill your\nglasses  to  the  brim.<br><br>Gentlemen,\nhere is my toast: To the prosperity of The\nManor  Farm!\"<br><br>There  was  the\nsame hearty cheering as before, and the\nmugs were emptied to the dregs.
