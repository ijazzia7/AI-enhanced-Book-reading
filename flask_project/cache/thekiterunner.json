["#$#$Chapter 1#$#$<br><br>December 2001 I became what I am\ntoday at the age of twelve, on a frigid\novercast  day  in  the  winter  of  1975.  I\nremember  the  precise  moment,\ncrouching  behind  a  crumbling  mud\nwall,  peeking  into  the  alley  near  the\nfrozen  creek.  That  was  a  long  time\nago,  but  it's  wrong  what  they  say\nabout  the  past,  I've  learned,  about\nhow  you  can  bury  it.  Because  the\npast claws its way out. Looking back\nnow,  I  realize  I  have  been  peeking\ninto  that  deserted  alley  for  the  last\ntwenty-six years.<br><br>   One  day  last  summer,  my  friend\nRahim Khan called from Pakistan. He\nasked me to come see him. Standing\nin the kitchen with the receiver to my\near, I knew it wasn't just Rahim Khan\non  the  line.  It  was  my  past  of\nunatoned**  sins.  After  I  hung  up,  I\nwent for a walk along Spreckels Lake", "on the northern edge of Golden Gate\nPark.  The  early-afternoon  sun\nsparkled  on  the  water  where  dozens\nof  miniature  boats  sailed,  propelled\nby a crisp breeze. Then I glanced up\nand saw a pair of kites, red with long\nblue  tails,  soaring  in  the  sky.  They\ndanced  high  above  the  trees  on  the\nwest  end  of  the  park,  over  the\nwindmills,  floating  side  by  side  like  a\npair  of  eyes  looking  down  on  San\nFrancisco,  the  city  I  now  call  home.\nAnd  suddenly  Hassan's  voice\nwhispered  in  my  head:  For  you,  a\nthousand  times  over.  Hassan  the\nharelipped kite runner.<br><br> I sat on a park bench near a willow\ntree.  I  thought  about  something\nRahim Khan said just before he hung\nup, almost as an after thought. There\nis  a  way  to  be  good  again.  I  looked\nup at those twin kites. I thought about\nHassan.  Thought  about  Baba.  Ali.\nKabul. I thought of the life I had lived\nuntil  the  winter  of  1975  came  and\nchanged  everything.  And  made  me", "what I am today.", "#$#$Chapter 2#$#$<br><br>When we were children, Hassan and\nI used to climb the poplar trees in the\ndriveway  of  my  father's  house  and\nannoy  our  neighbors  by  reflecting\nsunlight into their homes with a shard\nof  mirror.  We  would  sit  across  from\neach  other  on  a  pair  of  high\nbranches,  our  naked  feet  dangling,\nour trouser pockets filled with \ndried  mulberries  and  walnuts.  We\ntook  turns  with  the  mirror  as  we  ate\nmulberries,  pelted  each  other  with\nthem,  giggling,  laughing;  I  can  still\nsee  Hassan  up  on  that  tree,  sunlight\nflickering  through  the  leaves  on  his\nalmost  perfectly  round  face,  a  face\nlike  a  Chinese  doll  chiseled  from\nhardwood:  his  flat,  broad  nose  and\nslanting,  narrow  eyes  like  bamboo\nleaves,  eyes  that  looked,  depending\non  the  light,  gold,  green,  even\nsapphire  I  can  still  see  his  tiny\nlow-set ears and that pointed stub of", "a  chin,  a  meaty  appendage  that\nlooked  like  it  was  added  as  a  mere\nafterthought. And the cleft lip, just left\nof  midline,  where  the  Chinese  doll\nmaker's  instrument  may  have\nslipped;  or  perhaps  he  had  simply\ngrown tired and careless.<br><br>   Sometimes,  up  in  those  trees,  I\ntalked Hassan into firing walnuts with\nhis  slingshot  at  the  neighbor's\none-eyed German shepherd. Hassan\nnever wanted to, but if I asked, really\nasked, he wouldn't deny me. Hassan\nnever  denied  me  anything.  And  he\nwas  deadly  with  his  slingshot.\nHassan's father, Ali, used to catch us\nand get mad, or as mad as someone\nas  gentle  as  Ali  could  ever  get.  He\nwould  wag  his  finger  and  wave  us\ndown  from  the  tree.  He  would  take\nthe mirror and tell us what his mother\nhad  told  him,  that  the  devil  shone\nmirrors  too,  shone  them  to  distract\nMuslims  during  prayer.  \"And  he\nlaughs  while  he  does  it,\"  he  always\nadded, scowling at his son. ", "    \"Yes,  Father,\"  Hassan  would\nmumble, looking down at his feet. But\nhe  never  told  on  me.  Never  told  that\nthe  mirror,  like  shooting  walnuts  at\nthe  neighbor's  dog,  was  always  my\nidea.<br><br>   The  poplar  trees  lined  the  redbrick\ndriveway,  which  led  to  a  pair  of\nwrought-iron  gates.  They  in  turn\nopened  into  an  extension  of  the\ndriveway into my father's estate. The\nhouse sat on the left side of the brick\npath, the backyard at the end of it.<br><br> Everyone agreed that my father, my\nBaba,  had  built  the  most  beautiful\nhouse  in  the  Wazir  Akbar  Khan\ndistrict,  a  new  and  affluent\nneighborhood  in  the  northern  part  of\nKabul.  Some  thought  it  was  the\nprettiest  house  in  all  of  Kabul.  A\nbroad  entryway  flanked  by\nrosebushes  led  to  the  sprawling\nhouse  of  marble  floors  and  wide\nwindows.  Intricate  mosaic  tiles,", "handpicked  by  Baba  in  Isfahan,\ncovered  the  floors  of  the  four\nbathrooms.  Gold-stitched  tapestries,\nwhich  Baba  had  bought  in  Calcutta,\nlined  the  walls;  a  crystal  chandelier\nhung from the vaulted ceiling.<br><br>   Upstairs  was  my  bedroom,  Baba's\nroom,  and  his  study,  also  known  as\n\"the  smoking  room,\"  which\nperpetually  smelled  of  tobacco  and\ncinnamon.  Baba  and  his  friends\nreclined on black leather chairs there\nafter Ali had served dinner. \nThey stuffed their pipes--except Baba\nalways  called  it  \"fattening  the\npipe\"--and  discussed  their  favorite\nthree  topics:  politics,  business,\nsoccer.  Sometimes  I  asked  Baba  if  I\ncould  sit  with  them,  but  Baba  would\nstand  in  the  doorway.  \"Go  on,  now,\"\nhe'd  say.  \"This  is  grown-ups'  time.\nWhy  don't  you  go  read  one  of  those\nbooks of yours?\" He'd close the door,\nleave  me  to  wonder  why  it  was\nalways  grown-ups'  time  with  him.  I'd\nsit  by  the  door,  knees  drawn  to  my", "chest.  Sometimes  I  sat  there  for  an\nhour,  sometimes  two,  listening  to\ntheir laughter, their chatter.<br><br>   The  living  room  downstairs  had  a\ncurved  wall  with  custom  built\ncabinets.  Inside  sat  framed  family\npictures:  an  old,  grainy  photo  of  my\ngrandfather  and  King  Nadir  Shah\ntaken  in  1931,  two  years  before  the\nking's  assassination;  they  are\nstanding  over  a  dead  deer,  dressed\nin  knee-high  boots,  rifles  slung  over\ntheir  shoulders.  There  was  a  picture\nof  my  parents'  wedding  night,  Baba\ndashing  in  his  black  suit  and  my\nmother  a  smiling  young  princess  in\nwhite.  Here  was  Baba  and  his  best\nfriend  and  business  partner,  Rahim\nKhan,  standing  outside  our  house,\nneither  one  smiling--I  am  a  baby  in\nthat  photograph  and  Baba  is  holding\nme,  looking  tired  and  grim.  I'm  in  his\narms, but it's Rahim Khan's pinky my\nfingers are curled around.<br><br>   The  curved  wall  led  into  the  dining", "room,  at  the  center  of  which  was  a\nmahogany  table  that  could  easily  sit\nthirty  guests--and,  given  my  father's\ntaste  for  extravagant  parties,  it  did\njust  that  almost  every  week.  On  the\nother  end  of  the  dining  room  was  a\ntall marble fireplace, always lit by the\norange  glow  of  a  fire  in  the\nwintertime.<br><br>   A  large  sliding  glass  door  opened\ninto  a  semicircular  terrace  that\noverlooked  two  acres  of  backyard\nand  rows  of  cherry  trees.  Baba  and\nAli  had  planted  a  small  vegetable\ngarden  along  the  eastern  wall:\ntomatoes,  mint,  peppers,  and  a  row\nof corn that never really took. Hassan\nand I used to call it \"the Wall of Ailing\nCorn.\"<br><br>   On  the  south  end  of  the  garden,  in\nthe shadows of a loquat tree, was the\nservants'  home,  a  modest  little  mud\nhut  where  Hassan  lived  with  his\nfather. ", "  It was there, in that little shack, that\nHassan  was  born  in  the  winter  of\n1964,  just  one  year  after  my  mother\ndied giving birth to me.<br><br>   In  the  eighteen  years  that  I  lived  in\nthat  house,  I  stepped  into  Hassan\nand  Ali's  quarters  only  a  handful  of\ntimes.  When  the  sun  dropped  low\nbehind  the  hills  and  we  were  done\nplaying  for  the  day,  Hassan  and  I\nparted ways. I went past the \nrosebushes  to  Baba's  mansion,\nHassan  to  the  mud  shack  where  he\nhad  been  born,  where  he'd  lived  his\nentire  life.  I  remember  it  was  spare,\nclean,  dimly  lit  by  a  pair  of  kerosene\nlamps.  There  were  two  mattresses\non  opposite  sides  of  the  room,  a\nworn  Herati  rug  with  frayed  edges  in\nbetween, a three-legged stool, and a\nwooden  table  in  the  corner  where\nHassan  did  his  drawings.  The  walls\nstood bare, save for a single tapestry\nwith  sewn-in  beads  forming  the\nwords  Allah-u-akbar.  Baba  had\nbought it for Ali on one of his trips to", "Mashad.<br><br>   It  was  in  that  small  shack  that\nHassan's  mother,  Sanaubar,  gave\nbirth  to  him  one  cold  winter  day  in\n1964. While my mother hemorrhaged\nto  death  during  childbirth,  Hassan\nlost his less than a week after he was\nborn. Lost her to a fate most Afghans\nconsidered far worse than death: She\nran off with a clan of traveling singers\nand dancers.<br><br>   Hassan  never  talked  about  his\nmother,  as  if  she'd  never  existed.  I\nalways  wondered  if  he  dreamed\nabout  her,  about  what  she  looked\nlike, where she was. I wondered if he\nlonged  to  meet  her.  Did  he  ache  for\nher, the way I ached for the mother I\nhad  never  met?  One  day,  we  were\nwalking  from  my  father's  house  to\nCinema  Zainab  for  a  new  Iranian\nmovie,  taking  the  shortcut  through\nthe  military  barracks  near  Istiqlal\nMiddle  School--Baba  had  forbidden\nus to take that shortcut, but he was in", "Pakistan  with  Rahim  Khan  at  the\ntime.  We  hopped  the  fence  that\nsurrounded  the  barracks,  skipped\nover a little creek, and broke into the\nopen  dirt  field  where  old,  abandoned\ntanks  collected  dust.  A  group  of\nsoldiers  huddled  in  the  shade  of  one\nof  those  tanks,  smoking  cigarettes\nand  playing  cards.  One  of  them  saw\nus, elbowed the guy next to him, and\ncalled Hassan.<br><br> \"Hey, you!\" he said. \"I know you.\"<br><br> We had never seen him before. He\nwas  a  squatly  man  with  a  shaved\nhead  and  black  stubble  on  his  face.\nThe  way  he  grinned  at  us,  leered,\nscared  me.  \"Just  keep  walking,\"  I\nmuttered to Hassan.<br><br> \"You! The Hazara! Look at me when\nI'm talking to you!\" the soldier barked.\nHe  handed  his  cigarette  to  the  guy\nnext  to  him,  made  a  circle  with  the\nthumb  and  index  finger  of  one  hand.\nPoked  the  middle  finger  of  his  other", "hand  through  the  circle.  Poked  it  in\nand  out.  In  and  out.  \"I  knew  your\nmother,  did  you  know  that?  I  knew\nher real good. I took her from behind\nby that creek over there.\"<br><br>   The  soldiers  laughed.  One  of  them\nmade  a  squealing  sound.  I  told\nHassan  to  keep  walking,  keep\nwalking.<br><br>  \"What a tight little sugary cunt she\nhad!\" the soldier was saying, shaking\nhands  with  the  others,  grinning.\nLater, in the dark, after the movie had\nstarted,  I  heard  Hassan  next  to  me,\ncroaking.  Tears  were  sliding  down\nhis  cheeks.  I  reached  across  my\nseat,  slung  my  arm  around  him,\npulled him close. He rested his head\non  my  shoulder.  \"He  took  you  for\nsomeone else,\" I whispered. \"He took\nyou for someone else.\"<br><br> I'm told no one was really surprised\nwhen  Sanaubar  eloped.  People  had\nraised  their  eyebrows  when  Ali,  a\nman  who  had  memorized  the  Koran,", "married  Sanaubar,  a  woman\nnineteen  years  younger,  a  beautiful\nbut  notoriously  unscrupulous  woman\nwho  lived  up  to  her  dishonorable\nreputation.  Like  Ali,  she  was  a  Shi'a\nMuslim  and  an  ethnic  Hazara.  She\nwas  also  his  first  cousin  and\ntherefore  a  natural  choice  for  a\nspouse.  But  beyond  those\nsimilarities,  Ali  and  Sanaubar  had\nlittle  in  common,  least  of  all  their\nrespective  appearances.  While\nSanaubar's  brilliant  green  eyes  and\nimpish  face  had,  rumor  has  it,\ntempted  countless  men  into  sin,  Ali\nhad  a  congenital  paralysis  of  his\nlower facial muscles, a condition that\nrendered him unable to smile and left\nhim perpetually grim-faced. It was an\nodd  thing  to  see  the  stone-faced  Ali\nhappy,  or  sad,  because  only  his\nslanted  brown  eyes  glinted  with  a\nsmile  or  welled  with  sorrow.  People\nsay  that  eyes  are  windows  to  the\nsoul.  Never  was  that  more  true  than\nwith  Ali,  who  could  only  reveal\nhimself through his eyes. ", "    I  have  heard  that  Sanaubar's\nsuggestive  stride  and  oscillating  hips\nsent men to reveries of infidelity. But\npolio  had  left  Ali  with  a  twisted,\natrophied  right  leg  that  was  sallow\nskin  over  bone  with  little  in  between\nexcept a paper-thin layer of muscle. I\nremember  one  day,  when  I  was\neight, Ali was taking me to the bazaar\nto  buy  some  naan.  I  was  walking\nbehind  him,  humming,  trying  to\nimitate his walk. I watched him swing\nhis  scraggy  leg  in  a  sweeping  arc,\nwatched  his  whole  body  tilt\nimpossibly  to  the  right  every  time  he\nplanted  that  foot.  It  seemed  a  minor\nmiracle  he  didn't  tip  over  with  each\nstep. When I tried it, I almost fell into\nthe  gutter.  That  got  me  giggling.  Ali\nturned around, caught me aping him.\nHe  didn't  say  anything.  Not  then,  not\never. He just kept walking.<br><br>   Ali's  face  and  his  walk  frightened\nsome  of  the  younger  children  in  the\nneighborhood.  But  the  real  trouble", "was with the older kids. They chased\nhim  on  the  street,  and  mocked  him\nwhen  he  hobbled  by.  Some  had\ntaken  to  calling  him  Babalu,  or\nBoogeyman.<br><br>   \"Hey,  Babalu,  who  did  you  eat\ntoday?\"  they  barked  to  a  chorus  of\nlaughter.  \"Who  did  you  eat,  you\nflat-nosed Babalu?\" <br><br>   They  called  him  \"flat-nosed\"\nbecause  of  Ali  and  Hassan's\ncharacteristic  Hazara  Mongoloid\nfeatures.  For  years,  that  was  all  I\nknew  about  the  Hazaras,  that  they\nwere  Mogul  descendants,  and  that\nthey  looked  a  little  like  Chinese\npeople.  School  text  books  barely\nmentioned them and referred to their\nancestry  only  in  passing.  Then  one\nday,  I  was  in  Baba's  study,  looking\nthrough his stuff, when I found one of\nmy mother's old history books. It was\nwritten by an Iranian named Khorami.\nI  blew  the  dust  off  it,  sneaked  it  into\nbed  with  me  that  night,  and  was\nstunned  to  find  an  entire  chapter  on", "Hazara  history.  An  entire  chapter\ndedicated  to  Hassan's  people!  In  it,  I\nread  that  my  people,  the  Pashtuns,\nhad  persecuted  and  oppressed  the\nHazaras.  It  said  the  Hazaras  had\ntried  to  rise  against  the  Pashtuns  in\nthe  nineteenth  century,  but  the\nPashtuns  had  \"quelled  them  with\nunspeakable  violence.\"  The  book\nsaid  that  my  people  had  killed  the\nHazaras,  driven  them  from  their\nlands,  burned  their  homes,  and  sold\ntheir  women.  The  book  said  part  of\nthe  reason  Pashtuns  had  oppressed\nthe Hazaras was that Pashtuns were\nSunni  Muslims,  while  Hazaras  were\nShi'a.  The  book  said  a  lot  of  things  I\ndidn't  know,  things  my  teachers\nhadn't  mentioned.  Things  Baba\nhadn't  mentioned  either.  It  also  said\nsome  things  I  did  know,  like  that\npeople  called  Hazaras  mice-eating,\nflat-nosed,  load-carrying  donkeys.  I\nhad  heard  some  of  the  kids  in  the\nneighborhood  yell  those  names  to\nHassan. ", "    The  following  week,  after  class,  I\nshowed  the  book  to  my  teacher  and\npointed  to  the  chapter  on  the\nHazaras.  He  skimmed  through  a\ncouple  of  pages,  snickered,  handed\nthe  book  back.  \"That's  the  one  thing\nShi'a  people  do  well,\"  he  said,\npicking  up  his  papers,  \"passing\nthemselves  as  martyrs.\"  He  wrinkled\nhis  nose  when  he  said  the  word\nShi'a,  like  it  was  some  kind  of\ndisease.<br><br>   But  despite  sharing  ethnic  heritage\nand  family  blood,  Sanaubar  joined\nthe neighborhood kids in taunting Ali.\nI have heard that she made no secret\nof her disdain for his appearance.<br><br>   \"This  is  a  husband?\"  she  would\nsneer.  \"I  have  seen  old  donkeys\nbetter suited to be a husband.\"<br><br>   In  the  end,  most  people  suspected\nthe  marriage  had  been  an\narrangement of sorts between Ali and\nhis  uncle,  Sanaubar's  father.  They", "said  Ali  had  married  his  cousin  to\nhelp  restore  some  honor  to  his\nuncle's  blemished  name,  even\nthough  Ali,  who  had  been  orphaned\nat  the  age  of  five,  had  no  worldly\npossessions  or  inheritance  to  speak\nof.<br><br>   Ali  never  retaliated  against  any  of\nhis  tormentors,  I  suppose  partly\nbecause  he  could  never  catch  them\nwith  that  twisted  leg  dragging  behind\nhim.  But  mostly  because  Ali  was\nimmune  to  the  insults  of  his\nassailants; he had found \nhis  joy,  his  antidote,  the  moment\nSanaubar had given birth to Hassan.\nIt  had  been  a  simple  enough  affair.\nNo  obstetricians,  no\nanesthesiologists,  no  fancy\nmonitoring  devices.  Just  Sanaubar\nlying  on  a  stained,  naked  mattress\nwith  Ali  and  a  midwife  helping  her.\nShe  hadn't  needed  much  help  at  all,\nbecause,  even  in  birth,  Hassan  was\ntrue  to  his  nature:  He  was  incapable\nof  hurting  anyone.  A  few  grunts,  a", "couple  of  pushes,  and  out  came\nHassan. Out he came smiling.<br><br> As confided to a neighbor's servant\nby  the  garrulous  midwife,  who  had\nthen  in  turn  told  anyone  who  would\nlisten,  Sanaubar  had  taken  one\nglance at the baby in Ali's arms, seen\nthe  cleft  lip,  and  barked  a  bitter\nlaughter.<br><br>   \"There,\"  she  had  said.  \"Now  you\nhave  your  own  idiot  child  to  do  all\nyour  smiling  for  you!\"  She  had\nrefused  to  even  hold  Hassan,  and\njust five days later, she was gone.<br><br>   Baba  hired  the  same  nursing\nwoman  who  had  fed  me  to  nurse\nHassan.  Ali  told  us  she  was  a\nblue-eyed  Hazara  woman  from\nBamiyan, the city of the giant Buddha\nstatues. \"What a sweet singing voice\nshe had,\" he used to say to us.<br><br>   What  did  she  sing,  Hassan  and  I\nalways  asked,  though  we  already", "knew--Ali  had  told  us  countless\ntimes.  We  just  wanted  to  hear  Ali\nsing.<br><br> He'd clear his throat and begin: On\na  high  mountain  I  stood,  And  cried\nthe  name  of  Ali,  Lion  of  God  O  Ali,\nLion of God, King of Men, Bring joy to\nour  sorrowful  hearts.  Then  he  would\nremind  us  that  there  was  a\nbrotherhood  between  people  who\nhad  fed  from  the  same  breast,  a\nkinship  that  not  even  time  could\nbreak.<br><br>   Hassan  and  I  fed  from  the  same\nbreasts.  We  took  our  first  steps  on\nthe  same  lawn  in  the  same  yard.\nAnd,  under  the  same  roof,  we  spoke\nour first words.<br><br> Mine was Baba.<br><br> His was Amir. My name. <br><br>   Looking  back  on  it  now,  I  think  the\nfoundation  for  what  happened  in  the\nwinter  of  1975--and  all  that", "followed--was  already  laid  in  those\nfirst words.", "#$#$Chapter 3#$#$<br><br>Lore has it my father once wrestled a\nblack  bear  in  Baluchistan  with  his\nbare  hands.  If  the  story  had  been\nabout  anyone  else,  it  would  have\nbeen  dismissed  as  laaf,  that  Afghan\ntendency  to  exaggerate--sadly,\nalmost  a  national  affliction;  if\nsomeone bragged that his son was a\ndoctor,  chances  were  the  kid  had\nonce  passed  a  biology  test  in  high\nschool.  But  no  one  ever  doubted  the\nveracity of any story about Baba. And\nif they did, well, Baba did have those\nthree parallel scars coursing a jagged\npath down his back. I have imagined\nBaba's  wrestling  match  countless\ntimes, even dreamed about it. And in\nthose  dreams,  I  can  never  tell  Baba\nfrom the bear.<br><br>   It  was  Rahim  Khan  who  first\nreferred  to  him  as  what  eventually\nbecame  Baba's  famous  nickname,", "Toophan  agha,  or  \"Mr.  Hurricane.\"  It\nwas  an  apt  enough  nickname.  My\nfather  was  a  force  of  nature,  a\ntowering  Pashtun  specimen  with  a\nthick  beard,  a  wayward  crop  of  curly\nbrown  hair  as  unruly  as  the  man\nhimself, hands that looked capable of\nuprooting  a  willow  tree,  and  a  black\nglare that would \"drop the devil to his\nknees  begging  for  mercy,\"  as  Rahim\nKhan  used  to  say.  At  parties,  when\nall  six-foot-five  of  him  thundered  into\nthe room, attention shifted to him like\nsunflowers turning to the sun.<br><br>   Baba  was  impossible  to  ignore,\neven  in  his  sleep.  I  used  to  bury\ncotton  wisps  in  my  ears,  pull  the\nblanket  over  my  head,  and  still  the\nsounds  of  Baba's  snoring--so  much\nlike  a  growling  truck\nengine--penetrated the walls. And my\nroom was across the hall from Baba's\nbedroom.  How  my  mother  ever\nmanaged  to  sleep  in  the  same  room\nas him is a mystery to me. It's on the\nlong list of things I would have asked", "my mother if I had ever met her. <br><br> In the late 1960s, when I was five or\nsix,  Baba  decided  to  build  an\norphanage. I heard the story through\nRahim  Khan.  He  told  me  Baba  had\ndrawn  the  blueprints  himself  despite\nthe fact that he'd had no architectural\nexperience at all. Skeptics had urged\nhim  to  stop  his  foolishness  and  hire\nan  architect.  Of  course,  Baba\nrefused,  and  everyone  shook  their\nheads  in  dismay  at  his  obstinate\nways.  Then  Baba  succeeded  and\neveryone shook their heads in awe at\nhis  triumphant  ways.  Baba  paid  for\nthe  construction  of  the  two-story\norphanage,  just  off  the  main  strip  of\nJadeh  Maywand  south  of  the  Kabul\nRiver,  with  his  own  money.  Rahim\nKhan  told  me  Baba  had  personally\nfunded  the  entire  project,  paying  for\nthe engineers, electricians, plumbers,\nand  laborers,  not  to  mention  the  city\nofficials  whose  \"mustaches  needed\noiling.\"<br><br>   It  took  three  years  to  build  the", "orphanage.  I  was  eight  by  then.  I\nremember  the  day  before  the\norphanage opened, Baba took me to\nGhargha  Lake,  a  few  miles  north  of\nKabul. He asked me to fetch Hassan\ntoo,  but  I  lied  and  told  him  Hassan\nhad  the  runs.  I  wanted  Baba  all  to\nmyself.  And  besides,  one  time  at\nGhargha  Lake,  Hassan  and  I  were\nskimming  stones  and  Hassan  made\nhis stone skip eight times. The most I\nmanaged  was  five.  Baba  was  there,\nwatching,  and  he  patted  Hassan  on\nthe  back.  Even  put  his  arm  around\nhis shoulder.<br><br>   We  sat  at  a  picnic  table  on  the\nbanks of the lake, just Baba and me,\neating  boiled  eggs  with  kofta\nsandwiches--meatballs  and  pickles\nwrapped in naan.<br><br>   The  water  was  a  deep  blue  and\nsunlight  glittered  on  its  looking\nglass-clear  surface.  On  Fridays,  the\nlake was bustling with families out for\na day in the sun. But it was midweek", "and there was only Baba and me, us\nand  a  couple  of  longhaired,  bearded\ntourists--\"hippies,\"  I'd  heard  them\ncalled. They were sitting on the dock,\nfeet  dangling  in  the  water,  fishing\npoles in hand. I asked Baba why they\ngrew  their  hair  long,  but  Baba\ngrunted,  didn't  answer.  He  was\npreparing  his  speech  for  the  next\nday,  flipping  through  a  havoc  of\nhandwritten  pages,  making  notes\nhere and there with a pencil. I bit into\nmy egg and asked Baba if it was true\nwhat  a  boy  in  school  had  told  me,\nthat  if  you  ate  a  piece  of  eggshell,\nyou'd  have  to  pee  it  out.  Baba\ngrunted again.<br><br> I took a bite of my sandwich. One of\nthe  yellow-haired  tourists  laughed\nand  slapped  the  other  one  on  the\nback.  In  the  distance,  across  the\nlake,  a  truck  lumbered  around  a\ncorner on the hill. Sunlight twinkled in\nits side-view mirror.<br><br>   \"I  think  I  have  saratan,\"  I  said.", "Cancer. Baba lifted his head from the\npages  flapping  in  the  breeze.  Told\nme  I  could  get  the  soda  myself,  all  I\nhad to do was look in the trunk of the\ncar.<br><br>     Outside  the  orphanage,  the  next\nday,  they  ran  out  of  chairs.  A  lot  of\npeople  had  to  stand  to  watch  the\nopening  ceremony.  It  was  a  windy\nday,  and  I  sat  behind  Baba  on  the\nlittle  podium  just  outside  the  main\nentrance  of  the  new  building.  Baba\nwas  wearing  a  green  suit  and  a\ncaracul  hat.  Midway  through  the\nspeech, the wind knocked his hat off\nand  everyone  laughed.  He  motioned\nto  me  to  hold  his  hat  for  him  and  I\nwas  glad  to,  because  then  everyone\nwould see that he was my father, my\nBaba.  He  turned  back  to  the\nmicrophone  and  said  he  hoped  the\nbuilding  was  sturdier  than  his  hat,\nand  everyone  laughed  again.  When\nBaba  ended  his  speech,  people\nstood up and cheered. They clapped\nfor  a  long  time.  Afterward,  people\nshook  his  hand.  Some  of  them", "tousled  my  hair  and  shook  my  hand\ntoo. I was so proud of Baba, of us.<br><br>   But  despite  Baba's  successes,\npeople  were  always  doubting  him.\nThey  told  Baba  that  running  a\nbusiness  wasn't  in  his  blood  and  he\nshould  study  law  like  his  father.  So\nBaba  proved  them  all  wrong  by  not\nonly  running  his  own  business  but\nbecoming  one  of  the  richest\nmerchants in Kabul. Baba and Rahim\nKhan  built  a  wildly  successful\ncarpet-exporting  business,  two\npharmacies, and a restaurant.<br><br>   When  people  scoffed  that  Baba\nwould  never  marry  well--after  all,  he\nwas  not  of  royal  blood--he  wedded\nmy  mother,  Sofia  Akrami,  a  highly\neducated  woman  universally\nregarded  as  one  of  Kabul's  most\nrespected,  beautiful,  and  virtuous\nladies.  And  not  only  did  she  teach\nclassic  Farsi  literature  at  the\nuniversity  she  was  a  descendant  of\nthe royal family, a fact that my father", "playfully rubbed in the skeptics' faces\nby referring to her as \"my princess.\"<br><br>   With  me  as  the  glaring  exception,\nmy  father  molded  the  world  around\nhim  to  his  liking.  The  problem,  of\ncourse, was that Baba saw the world\nin  black  and  white.  And  he  got  to\ndecide what was black and what was\nwhite.  You  can't  love  a  person  who\nlives that way without fearing him too.\nMaybe even hating him a little.<br><br> When I was in fifth grade, we had a\nmullah  who  taught  us  about  Islam.\nHis name was Mullah Fatiullah Khan,\na short, stubby man with a face full of\nacne  scars  and  a  gruff  voice.  He\nlectured us about the virtues of zakat\nand the duty of hadj; he taught us the\nintricacies of performing the five daily\nnamaz  prayers,  and  made  us\nmemorize  verses  from  the\nKoran--and  though  he  never\ntranslated  the  words  for  us,  he  did\nstress,  sometimes  with  the  help  of  a\nstripped  willow  branch,  that  we  had", "to  pronounce  the  Arabic  words\ncorrectly  so  God  would  hear  us\nbetter. He told us one day that Islam\nconsidered  drinking  a  terrible  sin;\nthose  who  drank  would  answer  for\ntheir  sin  on  the  day  of  Qiyamat,\nJudgment  Day.  In  those  days,\ndrinking was fairly common in Kabul.\nNo one gave you a public lashing for\nit,  but  those  Afghans  who  did  drink\ndid so in private, out of respect. \nPeople  bought  their  scotch  as\n\"medicine\" in brown paper bags from\nselected  \"pharmacies.\"  They  would\nleave  with  the  bag  tucked  out  of\nsight,  sometimes  drawing  furtive,\ndisapproving glances from those who\nknew  about  the  store's  reputation  for\nsuch transactions.<br><br>   We  were  upstairs  in  Baba's  study,\nthe  smoking  room,  when  I  told  him\nwhat  Mullah  Fatiullah  Khan  had\ntaught us in class. Baba was pouring\nhimself  a  whiskey  from  the  bar  he\nhad  built  in  the  corner  of  the  room.\nHe  listened,  nodded,  took  a  sip  from", "his  drink.  Then  he  lowered  himself\ninto  the  leather  sofa,  put  down  his\ndrink, and propped me up on his lap.\nI  felt  as  if  I  were  sitting  on  a  pair  of\ntree  trunks.  He  took  a  deep  breath\nand exhaled through his nose, the air\nhissing  through  his  mustache  for\nwhat  seemed  an  eternity  I  couldn't\ndecide  whether  I  wanted  to  hug  him\nor leap from his lap in mortal fear.<br><br>   \"I  see  you've  confused  what  you're\nlearning  in  school  with  actual\neducation,\" he said in his thick voice.<br><br>   \"But  if  what  he  said  is  true  then\ndoes it make you a sinner, Baba?\"<br><br>   \"Hmm.\"  Baba  crushed  an  ice  cube\nbetween  his  teeth.  \"Do  you  want  to\nknow  what  your  father  thinks  about\nsin?\"<br><br> \"Yes.\"<br><br>   \"Then  I'll  tell  you,\"  Baba  said,  \"but\nfirst  understand  this  and  understand", "it  now,  Amir:  You'll  never  learn\nanything of value from those bearded\nidiots.\"<br><br> \"You mean Mullah Fatiullah Khan?\"<br><br>   Baba  gestured  with  his  glass.  The\nice  clinked.  \"I  mean  all  of  them.  Piss\non  the  beards  of  all  those\nself-righteous monkeys.\"<br><br>   I  began  to  giggle.  The  image  of\nBaba  pissing  on  the  beard  of  any\nmonkey,  self-righteous  or  otherwise,\nwas too much. <br><br>   \"They  do  nothing  but  thumb  their\nprayer  beads  and  recite  a  book\nwritten  in  a  tongue  they  don't  even\nunderstand.\"  He  took  a  sip.  \"God\nhelp  us  all  if  Afghanistan  ever  falls\ninto their hands.\"<br><br>   \"But  Mullah  Fatiullah  Khan  seems\nnice,\"  I  managed  between  bursts  of\ntittering.<br><br>   \"So  did  Genghis  Khan,\"  Baba  said.", "\"But  enough  about  that.  You  asked\nabout  sin  and  I  want  to  tell  you.  Are\nyou listening?\"<br><br>   \"Yes,\"  I  said,  pressing  my  lips\ntogether.  But  a  chortle  escaped\nthrough  my  nose  and  made  a\nsnorting  sound.  That  got  me  giggling\nagain.<br><br>   Baba's  stony  eyes  bore  into  mine\nand,  just  like  that,  I  wasn't  laughing\nanymore.<br><br>   \"I  mean  to  speak  to  you  man  to\nman.  Do  you  think  you  can  handle\nthat for once?\"<br><br>   \"Yes,  Baba  jan,\"  I  muttered,\nmarveling,  not  for  the  first  time,  at\nhow  badly  Baba  could  sting  me  with\nso  few  words.  We'd  had  a  fleeting\ngood  moment--it  wasn't  often  Baba\ntalked  to  me,  let  alone  on  his\nlap--and I'd been a fool to waste it.<br><br>   \"Good,\"  Baba  said,  but  his  eyes", "wondered.  \"Now,  no  matter  what  the\nmullah teaches, there is only one sin,\nonly  one.  And  that  is  theft.  Every\nother  sin  is  a  variation  of  theft.  Do\nyou understand that?\"<br><br>   \"No,  Baba  jan,\"  I  said,  desperately\nwishing  I  did.  I  didn't  want  to\ndisappoint him again.<br><br>   Baba  heaved  a  sigh  of  impatience.\nThat  stung  too,  because  he  was  not\nan  impatient  man.  I  remembered  all\nthe  times  he  didn't  come  home  until\nafter  dark,  all  the  times  I  ate  dinner\nalone.  I'd  ask  Ali  where  Baba  was,\nwhen he was coming home, though I\nknew  full  well  he  was  at  the\nconstruction  site,  overlooking  this,\nsupervising  that.  Didn't  that  take\npatience? I already hated all the kids\nhe was \nbuilding  the  orphanage  for;\nsometimes  I  wished  they'd  all  died\nalong with their parents.<br><br>   \"When  you  kill  a  man,  you  steal  a", "life,\"  Baba  said.  \"You  steal  his  wife's\nright to a husband, rob his children of\na  father.  When  you  tell  a  lie,  you\nsteal  someone's  right  to  the  truth.\nWhen  you  cheat,  you  steal  the  right\nto fairness. Do you see?\"<br><br>   I  did.  When  Baba  was  six,  a  thief\nwalked  into  my  grandfather's  house\nin  the  middle  of  the  night.  My\ngrandfather,  a  respected  judge,\nconfronted him, but the thief stabbed\nhim  in  the  throat,  killing  him\ninstantly--and  robbing  Baba  of  a\nfather.  The  townspeople  caught  the\nkiller  just  before  noon  the  next  day;\nhe  turned  out  to  be  a  wanderer  from\nthe Kunduz region. They hanged him\nfrom  the  branch  of  an  oak  tree  with\nstill two hours to go before afternoon\nprayer. It was Rahim Khan, not Baba,\nwho  had  told  me  that  story.  I  was\nalways  learning  things  about  Baba\nfrom other people.<br><br> \"There is no act more wretched than\nstealing,  Amir,\"  Baba  said.  \"A  man", "who takes what's not his to take, be it\na life or a loaf of naan... I spit on such\na man. And if I ever cross paths with\nhim,  God  help  him.  Do  you\nunderstand?\"<br><br> I found the idea of Baba clobbering\na  thief  both  exhilarating  and  terribly\nfrightening. \"Yes, Baba.\"<br><br>   \"If  there's  a  God  out  there,  then  I\nwould  hope  he  has  more  important\nthings  to  attend  to  than  my  drinking\nscotch  or  eating  pork.  Now,  hop\ndown.  All  this  talk  about  sin  has\nmade me thirsty again.\"<br><br> I watched him fill his glass at the bar\nand wondered how much time would\npass before we talked again the way\nwe  just  had.  Because  the  truth  of  it\nwas, I always felt like Baba hated me\na  little.  And  why  not?  After  all,  I  had\nkilled  his  beloved  wife,  his  beautiful\nprincess,  hadn't  I?  The  least  I  could\nhave  done  was  to  have  had  the\ndecency  to  have  turned  out  a  little", "more like him. But I hadn't turned out\nlike him. Not at all.<br><br> \nIN SCHOOL, we used to play a game\ncalled  Sherjangi,  or  \"Battle  of  the\nPoems.\"  The  Farsi  teacher\nmoderated  it  and  it  went  something\nlike  this:  You  recited  a  verse  from  a\npoem  and  your  opponent  had  sixty\nseconds  to  reply  with  a  verse  that\nbegan  with  the  same  letter  that\nended  yours.  Everyone  in  my  class\nwanted  me  on  their  team,  because\nby  the  time  I  was  eleven,  I  could\nrecite  dozens  of  verses  from\nKhayyam,  Hafez,  or  Rumi's  famous\nMasnawi.  One  time,  I  took  on  the\nwhole  class  and  won.  I  told  Baba\nabout  it  later  that  night,  but  he  just\nnodded, muttered, \"Good.\"<br><br> That was how I escaped my father's\naloofness,  in  my  dead  mother's\nbooks. That and Hassan, of course. I\nread everything, Rumi, Hafez, Saadi,\nVictor  Hugo,  Jules  Verne,  Mark", "Twain,  Ian  Fleming.  When  I  had\nfinished  my  mother's  books--not  the\nboring  history  ones,  I  was  never\nmuch  into  those,  but  the  novels,  the\nepics--I  started  spending  my\nallowance  on  books.  I  bought  one  a\nweek  from  the  bookstore  near\nCinema  Park,  and  stored  them  in\ncardboard  boxes  when  I  ran  out  of\nshelf room.<br><br> Of course, marrying a poet was one\nthing,  but  fathering  a  son  who\npreferred  burying  his  face  in  poetry\nbooks  to  hunting...  well,  that  wasn't\nhow  Baba  had  envisioned  it,  I\nsuppose.  Real  men  didn't  read\npoetry--and  God  forbid  they  should\never  write  it!  Real  men--real\nboys--played  soccer  just  as  Baba\nhad  when  he  had  been  young.  Now\nthat was something to be passionate\nabout.  In  1970,  Baba  took  a  break\nfrom  the  construction  of  the\norphanage  and  flew  to  Tehran  for  a\nmonth  to  watch  the  World  Cup\ngames  on  television,  since  at  the", "time Afghanistan didn't have TVs yet.\nHe signed me up for soccer teams to\nstir  the  same  passion  in  me.  But  I\nwas  pathetic,  a  blundering  liability  to\nmy  own  team,  always  in  the  way  of\nan  opportune  pass  or  unwittingly\nblocking  an  open  lane.  I  shambled\nabout  the  field  on  scraggy  legs,\nsqualled  for  passes  that  never  came\nmy  way.  And  the  harder  I  tried,\nwaving  my  arms  over  my  head\nfrantically  and  screeching,  \"I'm  open!\nI'm  open!\"  the  more  I  went  ignored.\nBut  Baba  wouldn't  give  up.  When  it\nbecame abundantly clear that I hadn't\ninherited  a  shred  of  his  athletic\ntalents,  he  settled  for  trying  to  turn\nme  into  a  passionate  spectator.\nCertainly  I  could  manage  that,\ncouldn't I? I faked interest for as long\nas possible. I cheered with him when\nKabul's  team  scored  against\nKandahar  and  yelped  insults  at  the\nreferee  when  he  called  a  penalty\nagainst  our  team.  But  Baba  sensed\nmy  lack  of  genuine  interest  and\nresigned himself to the bleak fact that", "his  son  was  never  going  to  either\nplay or watch soccer.<br><br> I remember one time Baba took me\nto  the  yearly  Buzkashi  tournament\nthat  took  place  on  the  first  day  of\nspring,  New  Year's  Day.  Buzkashi\nwas,  and  still  is,  Afghanistan's\nnational  passion.  A  chapandaz,  a\nhighly  skilled  horseman  usually\npatronized by rich aficionados, has to\nsnatch  a  goat  or  cattle  carcass  from\nthe  midst  of  a  melee,  carry  that\ncarcass with him around the stadium\nat full gallop, and drop it in a scoring\ncircle  while  a  team  of  other\nchapandaz  chases  him  and  does\neverything  in  its  power--kick,  claw,\nwhip, punch--to snatch the \ncarcass  from  him.  That  day,  the\ncrowd  roared  with  excitement  as  the\nhorsemen  on  the  field  bellowed  their\nbattle  cries  and  jostled  for  the\ncarcass in a cloud of dust. The earth\ntrembled  with  the  clatter  of  hooves.\nWe  watched  from  the  upper\nbleachers  as  riders  pounded  past  us", "at  full  gallop,  yipping  and  yelling,\nfoam flying from their horses' mouths.\n    At  one  point  Baba  pointed  to\nsomeone.  \"Amir,  do  you  see  that\nman sitting up there with those other\nmen around him?\"<br><br> I did.<br><br> \"That's Henry Kissinger.\"<br><br>   \"Oh,\"  I  said.  I  didn't  know  who\nHenry  Kissinger  was,  and  I  might\nhave  asked.  But  at  the  moment,  I\nwatched  with  horror  as  one  of  the\nchapandaz fell off his saddle and was\ntrampled  under  a  score  of  hooves.\nHis  body  was  tossed  and  hurled  in\nthe  stampede  like  a  rag  doll,  finally\nrolling  to  a  stop  when  the  melee\nmoved on. He twitched once and lay\nmotionless, his legs bent at unnatural\nangles,  a  pool  of  his  blood  soaking\nthrough the sand. ", "  I began to cry.<br><br>   I  cried  all  the  way  back  home.  I\nremember  how  Baba's  hands\nclenched  around  the  steering  wheel.\nClenched  and  unclenched.  Mostly,  I\nwill never forget Baba's valiant efforts\nto  conceal  the  disgusted  look  on  his\nface as he drove in silence.<br><br>   Later  that  night,  I  was  passing  by\nmy  father's  study  when  I  overheard\nhim  speaking  to  Rahim  Khan.  I\npressed my ear to the closed door.<br><br> \"--grateful that he's healthy,\" Rahim\nKhan was saying.<br><br>   \"I  know,  I  know.  But  he's  always\nburied  in  those  books  or  shuffling\naround  the  house  like  he's  lost  in\nsome dream.\" <br><br> \"And?\"<br><br>   \"I  wasn't  like  that.\"  Baba  sounded\nfrustrated, almost angry. ", "    Rahim  Khan  laughed.  \"Children\naren't  coloring  books.  You  don't  get\nto fill them with your favorite colors.\"<br><br> \"I'm telling you,\" Baba said, \"I wasn't\nlike  that  at  all,  and  neither  were  any\nof the kids I grew up with.\"<br><br>   \"You  know,  sometimes  you  are  the\nmost  self-centered  man  I  know,\"\nRahim  Khan  said.  He  was  the  only\nperson  I  knew  who  could  get  away\nwith  saying  something  like  that  to\nBaba.<br><br> \"It has nothing to do with that.\"<br><br> \"Nay?\"<br><br> \"Nay.\"<br><br> \"Then what?\"<br><br>   I  heard  the  leather  of  Baba's  seat\ncreaking  as  he  shifted  on  it.  I  closed\nmy  eyes,  pressed  my  ear  even\nharder  against  the  door,  wanting  to", "hear,  not  wanting  to  hear.\n\"Sometimes  I  look  out  this  window\nand  I  see  him  playing  on  the  street\nwith  the  neighborhood  boys.  I  see\nhow  they  push  him  around,  take  his\ntoys from him, give him a shove here,\na  whack  there.  And,  you  know,  he\nnever  fights  back.  Never.  He  just...\ndrops his head and...\"<br><br>   \"So  he's  not  violent,\"  Rahim  Khan\nsaid.<br><br>   \"That's  not  what  I  mean,  Rahim,\nand  you  know  it,\"  Baba  shot  back.\n\"There  is  something  missing  in  that\nboy.\"<br><br>  \"Yes, a mean streak.\"<br><br> \"Self-defense has nothing to do with\nmeanness.  You  know  what  always\nhappens  when  the  neighborhood\nboys tease him? Hassan steps in and\nfends  them  off.  I've  seen  it  with  my\nown  eyes.  And  when  they  come\nhome, I say to him, 'How did Hassan\nget  that  scrape  on  his  face?'  And  he", "says,  'He  fell  down.'  I'm  telling  you,\nRahim, there is something missing in\nthat boy.\"<br><br>   \"You  just  need  to  let  him  find  his\nway,\" Rahim Khan said.<br><br>   \"And  where  is  he  headed?\"  Baba\nsaid.  \"A  boy  who  won't  stand  up  for\nhimself  becomes  a  man  who  can't\nstand up to anything.\"<br><br> \"As usual you're oversimplifying.\"<br><br> \"I don't think so.\"<br><br> \"You're angry because you're afraid\nhe'll never take over the business for\nyou.\"<br><br>   \"Now  who's  oversimplifying?\"  Baba\nsaid.  \"Look,  I  know  there's  a\nfondness  between  you  and  him  and\nI'm  happy  about  that.

I  snapped  at  him,  told  him  to\nmind his own business. <br><br> Rahim Khan had been wrong about\nthe mean streak thing.", "#$#$Chapter 4#$#$<br><br>In 1933, the year Baba was born and\nthe  year  Zahir  Shah  began  his\nforty-year  reign  of  Afghanistan,  two\nbrothers,  young  men  from  a  wealthy\nand  reputable  family  in  Kabul,  got\nbehind  the  wheel  of  their  father's\nFord  roadster.  High  on  hashish  and\nmast on French wine, they struck and\nkilled a Hazara husband and wife on\nthe  road  to  Paghman.  The  police\nbrought the somewhat contrite young\nmen  and  the  dead  couple's\nfive-year-old  orphan  boy  before  my\ngrandfather,  who  was  a  highly\nregarded  judge  and  a  man  of\nimpeccable  reputation.  After  hearing\nthe  brothers'  account  and  their\nfather's  plea  for  mercy,  my\ngrandfather  ordered  the  two  young\nmen  to  go  to  Kandahar  at  once  and\nenlist  in  the  army  for  one  year--this\ndespite  the  fact  that  their  family  had\nsomehow  managed  to  obtain  them", "exemptions  from  the  draft.  Their\nfather  argued,  but  not  too\nvehemently,  and  in  the  end,\neveryone agreed that the punishment\nhad  been  perhaps  harsh  but  fair.  As\nfor  the  orphan,  my  grandfather\nadopted him into his own household,\nand  told  the  other  servants  to  tutor\nhim,  but  to  be  kind  to  him.  That  boy\nwas Ali.<br><br>   Ali  and  Baba  grew  up  together  as\nchildhood  playmates--at  least  until\npolio  crippled  Ali's  leg--just  like\nHassan  and  I  grew  up  a  generation\nlater.  Baba  was  always  telling  us\nabout the mischief he and Ali used to\ncause, and Ali would shake his head\nand  say,  \"But,  Agha  sahib,  tell  them\nwho was the architect of the mischief\nand  who  the  poor  laborer?\"  Baba\nwould  laugh  and  throw  his  arm\naround Ali.<br><br>   But  in  none  of  his  stories  did  Baba\never refer to Ali as his friend. ", "    The  curious  thing  was,  I  never\nthought of Hassan and me as friends\neither.  Not  in  the  usual  sense,\nanyhow.  Never  mind  that  we  taught\neach  other  to  ride  a  bicycle  with  no\nhands,  or  to  build  a  fully  functional\nhomemade  camera  out  of  a\ncardboard  box.  Never  mind  that  we\nspent  entire  winters  flying  kites,\nrunning \nkites. Never mind that to me, the face\nof Afghanistan is that of a boy with a\nthin-boned  frame,  a  shaved  head,\nand  low-set  ears,  a  boy  with  a\nChinese  doll  face  perpetually  lit  by  a\nharelipped smile.<br><br>   Never  mind  any  of  those  things.\nBecause  history  isn't  easy  to\novercome.  Neither  is  religion.  In  the\nend,  I  was  a  Pashtun  and  he  was  a\nHazara,  I  was  Sunni  and  he  was\nShi'a,  and  nothing  was  ever  going  to\nchange that. Nothing.<br><br>   But  we  were  kids  who  had  learned\nto  crawl  together,  and  no  history,", "ethnicity,  society,  or  religion  was\ngoing  to  change  that  either.  I  spent\nmost  of  the  first  twelve  years  of  my\nlife playing with Hassan. Sometimes,\nmy  entire  childhood  seems  like  one\nlong  lazy  summer  day  with  Hassan,\nchasing  each  other  between  tangles\nof  trees  in  my  father's  yard,  playing\nhide-and-seek,  cops  and  robbers,\ncowboys  and  Indians,  insect\ntorture--with  our  crowning\nachievement  undeniably  the  time  we\nplucked the stinger off a bee and tied\na string around the poor thing to yank\nit back every time it took flight.<br><br>   We  chased  the  Kochi,  the  nomads\nwho  passed  through  Kabul  on  their\nway  to  the  mountains  of  the  north.\nWe  would  hear  their  caravans\napproaching  our  neighborhood,  the\nmewling of their sheep, the baaing of\ntheir  goats,  the  jingle  of  bells  around\ntheir camels' necks. We'd run outside\nto  watch  the  caravan  plod  through\nour  street,  men  with  dusty,\nweather-beaten  faces  and  women", "dressed  in  long,  colorful  shawls,\nbeads,  and  silver  bracelets  around\ntheir  wrists  and  ankles.  We  hurled\npebbles  at  their  goats.  We  squirted\nwater  on  their  mules.  I'd  make\nHassan sit on the Wall of Ailing Corn\nand  fire  pebbles  with  his  slingshot  at\nthe camels' rears.<br><br>   We  saw  our  first  Western  together,\nRio  Bravo  with  John  Wayne,  at  the\nCinema  Park,  across  the  street  from\nmy  favorite  bookstore.  I  remember\nbegging  Baba  to  take  us  to  Iran  so\nwe  could  meet  John  Wayne.  Baba\nburst  out  in  gales  of  his\ndeep-throated  laughter--a  sound  not\nunlike  a  truck  engine  revving\nup--and,  when  he  could  talk  again,\nexplained  to  us  the  concept  of  voice\ndubbing. Hassan and I were stunned.\nDazed.  John  Wayne  didn't  really\nspeak  Farsi  and  he  wasn't  Iranian!\nHe  was  American,  just  like  the\nfriendly,  longhaired  men  and  women\nwe  always  saw  hanging  around  in\nKabul,  dressed  in  their  tattered,", "brightly  colored  shirts.  We  saw  Rio\nBravo  three  times,  but  we  saw  our\nfavorite  Western,  The  Magnificent\nSeven,  thirteen  times.  With  each\nviewing,  we  cried  at  the  end  when\nthe  Mexican  kids  buried  Charles\nBronson--who,  as  it  turned  out,\nwasn't Iranian either.<br><br>   We  took  strolls  in  the\nmusty-smelling  bazaars  of  the\nShar-e-Nau  section  of  Kabul,  or  the\nnew  city,  west  of  the  Wazir  Akbar\nKhan district. We talked about \nwhatever  film  we  had  just  seen  and\nwalked  amid  the  bustling  crowds  of\nbazarris. We snaked our way among\nthe  merchants  and  the  beggars,\nwandered  through  narrow  alleys\ncramped  with  rows  of  tiny,  tightly\npacked  stalls.  Baba  gave  us  each  a\nweekly  allowance  of  ten  Afghanis\nand  we  spent  it  on  warm  Coca-Cola\nand rosewater ice cream topped with\ncrushed pistachios.<br><br>   During  the  school  year,  we  had  a", "daily  routine.  By  the  time  I  dragged\nmyself  out  of  bed  and  lumbered  to\nthe  bathroom,  Hassan  had  already\nwashed  up,  prayed  the  morning\nnamaz  with  Ali,  and  prepared  my\nbreakfast:  hot  black  tea  with  three\nsugar  cubes  and  a  slice  of  toasted\nnaan  topped  with  my  favorite  sour\ncherry  marmalade,  all  neatly  placed\non  the  dining  table.  While  I  ate  and\ncomplained  about  homework,\nHassan  made  my  bed,  polished  my\nshoes,  ironed  my  outfit  for  the  day,\npacked  my  books  and  pencils.  I'd\nhear  him  singing  to  himself  in  the\nfoyer  as  he  ironed,  singing  old\nHazara  songs  in  his  nasal  voice.\nThen,  Baba  and  I  drove  off  in  his\nblack  Ford  Mustang--a  car  that  drew\nenvious looks everywhere because it\nwas  the  same  car  Steve  McQueen\nhad driven in Bullitt, a film that played\nin one theater for six months. Hassan\nstayed  home  and  helped  Ali  with  the\nday's  chores:  hand-washing  dirty\nclothes  and  hanging  them  to  dry  in\nthe yard, sweeping the floors, buying", "fresh  naan  from  the  bazaar,\nmarinating  meat  for  dinner,  watering\nthe lawn.<br><br>   After  school,  Hassan  and  I  met  up,\ngrabbed  a  book,  and  trotted  up  a\nbowl-shaped  hill  just  north  of  my\nfather's  property  in  Wazir  Akbar\nKhan.  There  was  an  old  abandoned\ncemetery  atop  the  hill  with  rows  of\nunmarked headstones and tangles of\nbrushwood  clogging  the  aisles.\nSeasons of rain and snow had turned\nthe  iron  gate  rusty  and  left  the\ncemetery's  low  white  stone  walls  in\ndecay.  There  was  a  pomegranate\ntree  near  the  entrance  to  the\ncemetery.  One  summer  day,  I  used\none  of  Ali's  kitchen  knives  to  carve\nour  names  on  it:  \"Amir  and  Hassan,\nthe  sultans  of  Kabul.\"  Those  words\nmade  it  formal:  the  tree  was  ours.\nAfter  school,  Hassan  and  I  climbed\nits  branches  and  snatched  its\nblood-red  pomegranates.  After  we'd\neaten  the  fruit  and  wiped  our  hands\non the grass, I would read to Hassan.", "    Sitting  cross-legged,  sunlight  and\nshadows  of  pomegranate  leaves\ndancing on his face, Hassan absently\nplucked  blades  of  grass  from  the\nground  as  I  read  him  stories  he\ncouldn't  read  for  himself.  That\nHassan  would  grow  up  illiterate  like\nAli  and  most  Hazaras  had  been\ndecided  the  minute  he  had  been\nborn,  perhaps  even  the  moment  he\nhad  been  conceived  in  Sanaubar's\nun-welcoming  womb--after  all,  what\nuse did a servant have for the written\nword?  But  despite  his  illiteracy,  or\nmaybe  because  of  it,  Hassan  was\ndrawn  to  the  mystery  of  words,\nseduced  by  a  secret  world  forbidden\nto him. I read him poems and stories,\nsometimes  riddles--though  I  stopped\nreading those when I saw he was far\nbetter at solving them than I was. So\nI  read  him  unchallenging  things,  like\nthe  misadventures  of  the  bumbling\nMullah  Nasruddin  and  his  donkey.\nWe sat for ", "hours  under  that  tree,  sat  there  until\nthe  sun  faded  in  the  west,  and  still\nHassan  insisted  we  had  enough\ndaylight for one more story, one more\nchapter.<br><br>   My  favorite  part  of  reading  to\nHassan was when we came across a\nbig  word  that  he  didn't  know.  I'd\ntease  him,  expose  his  ignorance.\nOne time, I was reading him a Mullah\nNasruddin  story  and  he  stopped  me.\n\"What does that word mean?\"<br><br> \"Which one?\"<br><br> \"Imbecile.\"<br><br>   \"You  don't  know  what  it  means?\"  I\nsaid, grinning.<br><br> \"Nay, Amir agha.\"<br><br> \"But it's such a common word!\"<br><br>   \"Still,  I  don't  know  it.\"  If  he  felt  the\nsting  of  my  tease,  his  smiling  face", "didn't show it.<br><br> \"Well, everyone in my school knows\nwhat it means,\" I said. \"Let's see.<br><br>   'Imbecile.'  It  means  smart,\nintelligent. I'll use it in a sentence for\nyou.<br><br> 'When it comes to words, Hassan is\nan imbecile.'\"<br><br> \"Aaah,\" he said, nodding.<br><br>   I  would  always  feel  guilty  about  it\nlater.  So  I'd  try  to  make  up  for  it  by\ngiving  him  one  of  my  old  shirts  or  a\nbroken  toy.  I  would  tell  myself  that\nwas  amends  enough  for  a  harmless\nprank.<br><br>     Hassan's  favorite  book  by  far  was\nthe  Shahnamah,  the  tenth-century\nepic  of  ancient  Persian  heroes.  He\nliked all of the chapters, the shahs of\nold, Feridoun, Zal, and Rudabeh. But\nhis  favorite  story,  and  mine,  was\n\"Rostam and Sohrab,\" the tale of the", "great  warrior  Rostam  and  his\nfleet-footed  horse,  Rakhsh.  Rostam\nmortally  wounds  his  valiant  nemesis,\nSohrab,  in  battle,  only  to  discover\nthat  Sohrab  is  his  long-lost  son.\nStricken with grief, Rostam hears his\nson's  dying  words:  If  thou  art  indeed\nmy father, then hast thou stained thy\nsword  in  the  life-blood  of  thy  son.\nAnd  thou  did'st  it  of  thine  obstinacy.\nFor  I  sought  to  turn  thee  unto  love,\nand I implored of thee thy name, for I\nthought  to  behold  in  thee  the  tokens\nrecounted  of  my  mother.  But  I\nappealed  unto  thy  heart  in  vain,  and\nnow is the time gone for meeting...<br><br>   \"Read  it  again  please,  Amir  agha,\"\nHassan  would  say.  Sometimes  tears\npooled  in  Hassan's  eyes  as  I  read\nhim  this  passage,  and  I  always\nwondered  whom  he  wept  for,  the\ngrief-stricken  Rostam  who  tears  his\nclothes  and  covers  his  head  with\nashes, or the dying Sohrab who only\nlonged  for  his  father's  love?\nPersonally, I couldn't see the tragedy", "in  Rostam's  fate.  After  all,  didn't  all\nfathers in their secret hearts harbor a\ndesire  to  kill  their  sons?  One  day,  in\nJuly 1973, I played another little trick\non Hassan. I was reading to him, and\nsuddenly  I  strayed  from  the  written\nstory. I pretended I was reading from\nthe book, flipping pages regularly, but\nI  had  abandoned  the  text  altogether,\ntaken  over  the  story,  and  made  up\nmy  own.  Hassan,  of  course,  was\noblivious  to  this.  To  him,  the  words\non  the  page  were  a  scramble  of\ncodes,  indecipherable,  mysterious.\nWords  were  secret  doorways  and  I\nheld  all  the  keys.  After,  I  started  to\nask  him  if  he'd  liked  the  story,  a\ngiggle  rising  in  my  throat,  when\nHassan began to clap.<br><br> \"What are you doing?\" I said.<br><br>   \"That  was  the  best  story  you've\nread me in a long time,\" he said, still\nclapping.<br><br> I laughed. \"Really?\" ", "  \"Really.\"<br><br>   \"That's  fascinating,\"  I  muttered.  I\nmeant  it  too.  This  was...  wholly\nunexpected. <br><br> \"Are you sure, Hassan?\"<br><br> He was still clapping. \"It was great,\nAmir agha. Will you read me more of\nit tomorrow?\"<br><br>   \"Fascinating,\"  I  repeated,  a  little\nbreathless,  feeling  like  a  man  who\ndiscovers  a  buried  treasure  in  his\nown backyard. Walking down the hill,\nthoughts  were  exploding  in  my  head\nlike  the  fireworks  at  Chaman.  Best\nstory  you've  read  me  in  a  long  time,\nhe'd  said.  I  had  read  him  a  lot  of\nstories.  Hassan  was  asking  me\nsomething.<br><br> \"What?\" I said.<br><br>   \"What  does  that  mean,\n'fascinating'?\" ", "    I  laughed.  Clutched  him  in  a  hug\nand planted a kiss on his cheek.<br><br>   \"What  was  that  for?\"  he  said,\nstartled, blushing.<br><br> I gave him a friendly shove. Smiled.\n\"You're  a  prince,  Hassan.  You're  a\nprince and I love you.\"<br><br>   That  same  night,  I  wrote  my  first\nshort story. It took me thirty minutes.\nIt  was  a  dark  little  tale  about  a  man\nwho  found  a  magic  cup  and  learned\nthat if he wept into the cup, his tears\nturned  into  pearls.  But  even  though\nhe  had  always  been  poor,  he  was  a\nhappy  man  and  rarely  shed  a  tear.\nSo  he  found  ways  to  make  himself\nsad so that his tears could make him\nrich. As the pearls piled up, so did his\ngreed grow. The story ended with the\nman  sitting  on  a  mountain  of  pearls,\nknife in hand, weeping helplessly into\nthe  cup  with  his  beloved  wife's  slain\nbody in his arms. ", "    That  evening,  I  climbed  the  stairs\nand  walked  into  Baba's  smoking\nroom, in my hands the two sheets of\npaper  on  which  I  had  scribbled  the\nstory.  Baba  and  Rahim  Khan  were\nsmoking  pipes  and  sipping  brandy\nwhen I came in. <br><br>   \"What  is  it,  Amir?\"  Baba  said,\nreclining  on  the  sofa  and  lacing  his\nhands  behind  his  head.  Blue  smoke\nswirled  around  his  face.  His  glare\nmade  my  throat  feel  dry.  I  cleared  it\nand told him I'd written a story.<br><br> Baba nodded and gave a thin smile\nthat conveyed little more than feigned\ninterest.  \"Well,  that's  very  good,  isn't\nit?\"  he  said.  Then  nothing  more.  He\njust  looked  at  me  through  the  cloud\nof smoke.<br><br>   I  probably  stood  there  for  under  a\nminute, but, to this day, it was one of\nthe  longest  minutes  of  my  life.\nSeconds plodded by, each separated\nfrom the next by an eternity. Air grew", "heavy  damp,  almost  solid.  I  was\nbreathing  bricks.  Baba  went  on\nstaring  me  down,  and  didn't  offer  to\nread.<br><br> As always, it was Rahim Khan who\nrescued  me.  He  held  out  his  hand\nand favored me with a smile that had\nnothing feigned about it. \"May I have\nit, Amir jan? I would very much like to\nread  it.\"  Baba  hardly  ever  used  the\nterm  of  endearment  jan  when  he\naddressed me.<br><br>   Baba  shrugged  and  stood  up.  He\nlooked relieved, as if he too had been\nrescued by Rahim Khan. \"Yes, give it\nto  Kaka  Rahim.  I'm  going  upstairs  to\nget  ready.\"  And  with  that,  he  left  the\nroom.  Most  days  I  worshiped  Baba\nwith  an  intensity  approaching  the\nreligious.  But  right  then,  I  wished  I\ncould  open  my  veins  and  drain  his\ncursed blood from my body.<br><br>   An  hour  later,  as  the  evening  sky\ndimmed, the two of them drove off in", "my  father's  car  to  attend  a  party.  On\nhis  way  out,  Rahim  Khan  hunkered\nbefore  me  and  handed  me  my  story\nand  another  folded  piece  of  paper.\nHe  flashed  a  smile  and  winked.  \"For\nyou.  Read  it  later.\"  Then  he  paused\nand  added  a  single  word  that  did\nmore  to  encourage  me  to  pursue\nwriting  than  any  compliment  any\neditor  has  ever  paid  me.  That  word\nwas Bravo.<br><br> When they left, I sat on my bed and\nwished  Rahim  Khan  had  been  my\nfather.  Then  I  thought  of  Baba  and\nhis  great  big  chest  and  how  good  it\nfelt  when  he  held  me  against  it,  how\nhe  smelled  of  Brut  in  the  morning,\nand  how  his  beard  tickled  my  face.  I\nwas overcome with such sudden guilt\nthat  I  bolted  to  the  bathroom  and\nvomited in the sink.<br><br>   Later  that  night,  curled  up  in  bed,  I\nread  Rahim  Khan's  note  over  and\nover. It read like this: <br><br>  Amir jan, I enjoyed your story very", "much.  Mashallah,  God  has  granted\nyou  a  special  talent.  It  is  now  your\nduty  to  hone  that  talent,  because  a\nperson  who  wastes  his  God-given\ntalents is a donkey. You have written\nyour  story  with  sound  grammar  and\ninteresting  style.  But  the  most\nimpressive  thing  about  your  story  is\nthat  it  has  irony.  You  may  not  even\nknow what that word means. But you\nwill  someday.  It  is  something  that\nsome  writers  reach  for  their  entire\ncareers  and  never  attain.  You  have\nachieved it with your first story.<br><br> My door is and always will be open\nto  you,  Amir  jan.  I  shall  hear  any\nstory you have to tell. Bravo.<br><br> Your friend,<br><br> Rahim<br><br>\nBuoyed  by  Rahim  Khan's  note,  I\ngrabbed  the  story  and  hurried", "downstairs to the foyer where Ali and\nHassan were sleeping on a mattress.\nThat  was  the  only  time  they  slept  in\nthe house, when Baba was away and\nAli  had  to  watch  over  me.  I  shook\nHassan  awake  and  asked  him  if  he\nwanted to hear a story.<br><br>   He  rubbed  his  sleep-clogged  eyes\nand  stretched.  \"Now?  What  time  is\nit?\"<br><br>   \"Never  mind  the  time.  This  story's\nspecial.  I  wrote  it  myself,\"  I\nwhispered,  hoping  not  to  wake  Ali.\nHassan's face brightened.<br><br>   \"Then  I  have  to  hear  it,\"  he  said,\nalready pulling the blanket off him.<br><br> I read it to him in the living room by\nthe  marble  fireplace.  No  playful\nstraying from the words this time; this\nwas  about  me!  Hassan  was  the\nperfect  audience  in  many  ways,\ntotally  immersed  in  the  tale,  his  face\nshifting  with  the  changing  tones  in", "the  story.  When  I  read  the  last\nsentence, he made a muted clapping\nsound with his hands.<br><br>  \"Mashallah, Amir agha. Bravo!\" He\nwas beaming.<br><br>   \"You  liked  it?\"  I  said,  getting  my\nsecond  taste--and  how  sweet  it\nwas--of a positive review.<br><br> \"Some day, Inshallah, you will be a\ngreat  writer,\"  Hassan  said.  \"And\npeople  all  over  the  world  will  read\nyour stories.\"<br><br>   \"You  exaggerate,  Hassan,\"  I  said,\nloving him for it.<br><br> \"No. You will be great and famous,\"\nhe insisted. Then he paused, as if on\nthe  verge  of  adding  something.  He\nweighed  his  words  and  cleared  his\nthroat. \"But will you permit me to ask\na  question  about  the  story?\"  he  said\nshyly.<br><br> \"Of course.\" ", "  \"Well...\" he started, broke off.<br><br>   \"Tell  me,  Hassan,\"  I  said.  I  smiled,\nthough  suddenly  the  insecure  writer\nin  me  wasn't  so  sure  he  wanted  to\nhear it.<br><br>   \"Well,\"  he  said,  \"if  I  may  ask,  why\ndid the man kill his wife? In fact, why\ndid  he  ever  have  to  feel  sad  to  shed\ntears?  Couldn't  he  have  just  smelled\nan onion?\"<br><br> I was stunned. That particular point,\nso  obvious  it  was  utterly  stupid,\nhadn't even occurred to me. I moved\nmy  lips  soundlessly.  It  appeared  that\non  the  same  night  I  had  learned\nabout  one  of  writing's  objectives,\nirony,  I  would  also  be  introduced  to\none  of  its  pitfalls:  the  Plot  Hole.\nTaught  by  Hassan,  of  all  people.\nHassan  who  couldn't  read  and  had\nnever  written  a  single  word  in  his\nentire  life.  A  voice,  cold  and  dark,\nsuddenly  whispered  in  my  ear,  What", "does  he  know,  that  illiterate  Hazara?\nHe'll  never  be  anything  but  a  cook.\nHow  dare  he  criticize  you?  \"Well,\"  I\nbegan.  But  I  never  got  to  finish  that\nsentence. <br><br>   Because  suddenly  Afghanistan\nchanged forever.", "#$#$Chapter 5#$#$<br><br>Something  roared  like  thunder.  The\nearth shook a little and we heard the\nrat-a-tat-tat  of  gunfire.  \"Father!\"\nHassan  cried.  We  sprung  to  our  feet\nand raced out of the living room. We\nfound  Ali  hobbling  frantically  across\nthe foyer.<br><br>   \"Father!  What's  that  sound?\"\nHassan  yelped,  his  hands\noutstretched  toward  Ali.  Ali  wrapped\nhis  arms  around  us.  A  white  light\nflashed, lit the sky in silver. It flashed\nagain  and  was  followed  by  a  rapid\nstaccato of gunfire.<br><br>   \"They're  hunting  ducks,\"  Ali  said  in\na  hoarse  voice.  \"They  hunt  ducks  at\nnight, you know. Don't be afraid.\"<br><br>   A  siren  went  off  in  the  distance.\nSomewhere  glass  shattered  and\nsomeone shouted. I heard people on", "the  street,  jolted  from  sleep  and\nprobably  still  in  their  pajamas,  with\nruffled  hair  and  puffy  eyes.  Hassan\nwas  crying.  Ali  pulled  him  close,\nclutched him with tenderness. Later, I\nwould tell myself I hadn't felt envious\nof Hassan. Not at all.<br><br>   We  stayed  huddled  that  way  until\nthe  early  hours  of  the  morning.  The\nshootings  and  explosions  had  lasted\nless  than  an  hour,  but  they  had\nfrightened us badly, because none of\nus  had  ever  heard  gunshots  in  the\nstreets.  They  were  foreign  sounds  to\nus  then.  The  generation  of  Afghan\nchildren  whose  ears  would  know\nnothing but the sounds of bombs and\ngunfire  was  not  yet  born.  Huddled\ntogether  in  the  dining  room  and\nwaiting for the sun to rise, none of us\nhad any notion that a way of life had\nended.  Our  way  of  life.  If  not  quite\nyet, then at least it was the beginning\nof  the  end.  The  end,  the  official  end,\nwould  come  first  in  April  1978  with\nthe  communist  coup  d'etat,  and  then", "in December 1979, when \nRussian tanks would roll into the very\nsame  streets  where  Hassan  and  I\nplayed,  bringing  the  death  of  the\nAfghanistan  I  knew  and  marking  the\nstart  of  a  still  ongoing  era  of\nbloodletting.<br><br>   Just  before  sunrise,  Baba's  car\npeeled  into  the  driveway.  His  door\nslammed  shut  and  his  running\nfootsteps  pounded  the  stairs.  Then\nhe  appeared  in  the  doorway  and  I\nsaw  something  on  his  face.\nSomething  I  didn't  recognize  right\naway  because  I'd  never  seen  it\nbefore:  fear.  \"Amir!  Hassan!\"  he\nexclaimed  as  he  ran  to  us,  opening\nhis  arms  wide.  \"They  blocked  all  the\nroads and the telephone didn't work. I\nwas so worried!\"<br><br> We let him wrap us in his arms and,\nfor a brief insane moment, I was glad\nabout  whatever  had  happened  that\nnight. ", " \nTHEY  WEREN'T  SHOOTING  ducks\nafter  all.  As  it  turned  out,  they  hadn't\nshot  much  of  anything  that  night  of\nJuly  17,  1973.  Kabul  awoke  the  next\nmorning  to  find  that  the  monarchy\nwas  a  thing  of  the  past.  The  king,\nZahir  Shah,  was  away  in  Italy.  In  his\nabsence, his cousin Daoud Khan had\nended the king's forty-year reign with\na bloodless coup.<br><br> I remember Hassan and I crouching\nthat next morning outside my father's\nstudy,  as  Baba  and  Rahim  Khan\nsipped  black  tea  and  listened  to\nbreaking  news  of  the  coup  on  Radio\nKabul.<br><br> \"Amir agha?\" Hassan whispered.<br><br> \"What?\"<br><br> \"What's a 'republic'?\"<br><br>   I  shrugged.  \"I  don't  know.\"  On", "Baba's  radio,  they  were  saying  that\nword, \"republic,\" over and over again.\n<br><br> \"Amir agha?\"<br><br> \"What?\"<br><br>   \"Does  'republic'  mean  Father  and  I\nwill have to move away?\"<br><br> \"I don't think so,\" I whispered back.<br><br>   Hassan  considered  this.  \"Amir\nagha?\"<br><br> \"What?\"<br><br>   \"I  don't  want  them  to  send  me  and\nFather away.\"<br><br>   I  smiled.  \"Bas,  you  donkey.  No\none's sending you away.\"<br><br> \"Amir agha?\"<br><br> \"What?\" ", "  \"Do you want to go climb our tree?\"<br><br>   My  smile  broadened.  That  was\nanother  thing  about  Hassan.  He\nalways  knew  when  to  say  the  right\nthing--the  news  on  the  radio  was\ngetting pretty boring. Hassan went to\nhis  shack  to  get  ready  and  I  ran\nupstairs  to  grab  a  book.  Then  I  went\nto  the  kitchen,  stuffed  my  pockets\nwith  handfuls  of  pine  nuts,  and  ran\noutside  to  find  Hassan  waiting  for\nme. We burst through the front gates\nand headed for the hill.<br><br>   We  crossed  the  residential  street\nand  were  trekking  through  a  barren\npatch of rough land that led to the hill\nwhen,  suddenly,  a  rock  struck\nHassan in \nthe back. We whirled around and my\nheart  dropped.  Assef  and  two  of  his\nfriends,  Wali  and  Kamal,  were\napproaching us.<br><br>   Assef  was  the  son  of  one  of  my\nfather's  friends,  Mahmood,  an  airline", "pilot.  His  family  lived  a  few  streets\nsouth  of  our  home,  in  a  posh,\nhigh-walled  compound  with  palm\ntrees.  If  you  were  a  kid  living  in  the\nWazir  Akbar  Khan  section  of  Kabul,\nyou  knew  about  Assef  and  his\nfamous  stainless-steel  brass\nknuckles,  hopefully  not  through\npersonal  experience.  Born  to  a\nGerman  mother  and  Afghan  father,\nthe  blond,  blue-eyed  Assef  towered\nover  the  other  kids.  His  well-earned\nreputation for savagery preceded him\non  the  streets.  Flanked  by  his\nobeying  friends,  he  walked  the\nneighborhood  like  a  Khan  strolling\nthrough  his  land  with  his\neager-to-please  entourage.  His  word\nwas  law,  and  if  you  needed  a  little\nlegal  education,  then  those  brass\nknuckles  were  just  the  right  teaching\ntool.  I  saw  him  use  those  knuckles\nonce  on  a  kid  from  the  Karteh-Char\ndistrict. I will never forget how Assef's\nblue  eyes  glinted  with  a  light  not\nentirely  sane  and  how  he  grinned,\nhow  he  grinned,  as  he  pummeled", "that  poor  kid  unconscious.  Some  of\nthe  boys  in  Wazir  Akbar  Khan  had\nnicknamed  him  Assef  Goshkhor,  or\nAssef  \"the  Ear  Eater.\"  Of  course,\nnone of them dared utter it to his face\nunless  they  wished  to  suffer  the\nsame  fate  as  the  poor  kid  who  had\nunwittingly  inspired  that  nickname\nwhen he had fought Assef over a kite\nand  ended  up  fishing  his  right  ear\nfrom  a  muddy  gutter.  Years  later,  I\nlearned  an  English  word  for  the\ncreature  that  Assef  was,  a  word  for\nwhich  a  good  Farsi  equivalent  does\nnot exist: \"sociopath.\"<br><br>   Of  all  the  neighborhood  boys  who\ntortured  Ali,  Assef  was  by  far  the\nmost  relentless.  He  was,  in  fact,  the\noriginator  of  the  Babalu  jeer,  Hey,\nBabalu, who did you eat today? Huh?\nCome  on,  Babalu,  give  us  a  smile! \nAnd on days when he felt particularly\ninspired,  he  spiced  up  his  badgering\na  little,  Hey,  you  flat-nosed  Babalu,\nwho  did  you  eat  today?  Tell  us,  you\nslant-eyed  donkey!  Now  he  was", "walking toward us, hands on his hips,\nhis  sneakers  kicking  up  little  puffs  of\ndust.<br><br>   \"Good  morning,  kunis!\"  Assef\nexclaimed,  waving.  \"Fag,\"  that  was\nanother  of  his  favorite  insults.\nHassan  retreated  behind  me  as  the\nthree  older  boys  closed  in.  They\nstood  before  us,  three  tall  boys\ndressed  in  jeans  and  T-shirts.\nTowering  over  us  all,  Assef  crossed\nhis thick arms on his chest, a savage\nsort of grin on his lips. Not for the first\ntime,  it  occurred  to  me  that  Assef\nmight  not  be  entirely  sane.  It  also\noccurred  to  me  how  lucky  I  was  to\nhave  Baba  as  my  father,  the  sole\nreason,  I  believe,  Assef  had  mostly\nrefrained  from  harassing  me  too\nmuch.<br><br> He tipped his chin to Hassan. \"Hey,\nFlat-Nose,\"  he  said.  \"How  is\nBabalu?\"<br><br>   Hassan  said  nothing  and  crept", "another step behind me.<br><br>  \"Have you heard the news, boys?\"\nAssef  said,  his  grin  never  faltering.\n\"The  king  is  gone.  Good  riddance.\nLong  live  the  president!  My  father\nknows  Daoud  Khan,  did  you  know\nthat, Amir?\"<br><br>   \"So  does  my  father,\"  I  said.  In\nreality,  I  had  no  idea  if  that  was  true\nor not.<br><br>   \"So  does  my  father,\"  Assef\nmimicked  me  in  a  whining  voice.\nKamal  and  Wali  cackled  in  unison.  I\nwished Baba were there.<br><br>   \"Well,  Daoud  Khan  dined  at  our\nhouse  last  year,\"  Assef  went  on.\n\"How do you like that, Amir?\"<br><br> I wondered if anyone would hear us\nscream  in  this  remote  patch  of  land.\nBaba's  house  was  a  good  kilometer\naway.  I  wished  we'd  stayed  at  the\nhouse. ", "  \"Do you know what I will tell Daoud\nKhan  the  next  time  he  comes  to  our\nhouse  for  dinner?\"  Assef  said.  \"I'm\ngoing  to  have  a  little  chat  with  him,\nman  to  man,  mard  to  mard.  Tell  him\nwhat  I  told  my  mother.  About  Hitler.\nNow,  there  was  a  leader.  A  great\nleader.  A  man  with  vision.  I'll  tell\nDaoud Khan to remember that if they\nhad  let  Hitler  finish  what  he  had\nstarted,  the  world  be  a  better  place\nnow\"<br><br> \"Baba says Hitler was crazy, that he\nordered  a  lot  of  innocent  people\nkilled,\"  I  heard  myself  say  before  I\ncould clamp a hand on my mouth.<br><br>   Assef  snickered.  \"He  sounds  like\nmy  mother,  and  she's  German;  she\nshould  know  better.  But  then  they\nwant  you  to  believe  that,  don't  they?\nThey  don't  want  you  to  know  the\ntruth.\"<br><br>   I  didn't  know  who  \"they\"  were,  or\nwhat  truth  they  were  hiding,  and  I", "didn't  want  to  find  out.  I  wished  I\nhadn't  said  anything.  I  wished  again\nI'd  look  up  and  see  Baba  coming  up\nthe hill. <br><br>   \"But  you  have  to  read  books  they\ndon't  give  out  in  school,\"  Assef  said.\n\"I  have.  And  my  eyes  have  been\nopened. Now I have a vision, and I'm\ngoing  to  share  it  with  our  new\npresident. Do you know what it is?\"<br><br>   I  shook  my  head.  He'd  tell  me\nanyway;  Assef  always  answered  his\nown questions.<br><br>   His  blue  eyes  flicked  to  Hassan.\n\"Afghanistan is the land of Pashtuns.\nIt  always  has  been,  always  will  be.\nWe  are  the  true  Afghans,  the  pure\nAfghans, not this Flat-Nose here. His\npeople  pollute  our  homeland,  our\nwatan.  They  dirty  our  blood.\"  He\nmade a sweeping, grandiose gesture\nwith  his  hands.  \"Afghanistan  for\nPashtuns, I say. That's my vision.\"<br><br> Assef shifted his gaze to me again.", "He  looked  like  someone  coming  out\nof a good dream. \"Too late for Hitler,\"\nhe said. \"But not for us.\"<br><br> He reached for something from the\nback pocket of his jeans. \"I'll ask the\npresident  to  do  what  the  king  didn't\nhave  the  quwat  to  do.  To  rid\nAfghanistan  of  all  the  dirty,  Kasseef\nHazaras.\"<br><br> \"Just let us go, Assef,\" I said, hating\nthe  way  my  voice  trembled.  \"We're\nnot bothering you.\"<br><br>   \"Oh,  you're  bothering  me,\"  Assef\nsaid.  And  I  saw  with  a  sinking  heart\nwhat he had fished out of his pocket.\nOf  course.  His  stainless-steel  brass\nknuckles sparkled in the sun. \"You're\nbothering me very much. In fact, you\nbother  me  more  than  this  Hazara\nhere.  How  can  you  talk  to  him,  play\nwith him, let him touch you?\" he said,\nhis  voice  dripping  with  disgust.  Wali\nand  Kamal  nodded  and  grunted  in\nagreement. Assef narrowed his eyes.", "Shook  his  head.  When  he  spoke\nagain,  he  sounded  as  baffled  as  he\nlooked.  \"How  can  you  call  him  your\n'friend'?\"<br><br>   But  he's  not  my  friend!  I  almost\nblurted. He's my servant! Had I really\nthought  that?  Of  course  I  hadn't.  I\nhadn't. I treated Hassan well, just like\na  friend,  better  even,  more  like  a\nbrother.  But  if  so,  then  why,  when\nBaba's friends came to visit with their\nkids,  didn't  I  ever  include  Hassan  in\nour  games?  Why  did  I  play  with\nHassan  only  when  no  one  else  was\naround?  Assef  slipped  on  the  brass\nknuckles.  Gave  me  an  icy  look.\n\"You're  part  of  the  problem,  Amir.  If\nidiots  like  you  and  your  father  didn't\ntake  these  people  in,  we'd  be  rid  of\nthem by now. \nThey'd  all  just  go  rot  in  Hazarajat\nwhere they belong. You're a disgrace\nto Afghanistan.\"<br><br>   I  looked  in  his  crazy  eyes  and  saw\nthat  he  meant  it.  He  really  meant  to", "hurt  me.  Assef  raised  his  fist  and\ncame for me.<br><br>   There  was  a  flurry  of  rapid\nmovement  behind  me.  Out  of  the\ncorner of my eye, I saw Hassan bend\ndown  and  stand  up  quickly.  Assef's\neyes  flicked  to  something  behind  me\nand widened with surprise. I saw that\nsame look of astonishment on Kamal\nand  Wali's  faces  as  they  too  saw\nwhat had happened behind me.<br><br> I turned and came face to face with\nHassan's  slingshot.  Hassan  had\npulled  the  wide  elastic  band  all  the\nway  back.  In  the  cup  was  a  rock  the\nsize  of  a  walnut.  Hassan  held  the\nslingshot  pointed  directly  at  Assef's\nface.  His  hand  trembled  with  the\nstrain  of  the  pulled  elastic  band  and\nbeads  of  sweat  had  erupted  on  his\nbrow.<br><br>   \"Please  leave  us  alone,  Agha,\"\nHassan  said  in  a  flat  tone.  He'd\nreferred  to  Assef  as  \"Agha,\"  and  I", "wondered briefly what it must be like\nto  live  with  such  an  ingrained  sense\nof one's place in a hierarchy.<br><br> Assef gritted his teeth. \"Put it down,\nyou motherless Hazara.\"<br><br> \"Please leave us be, Agha,\" Hassan\nsaid.<br><br>   Assef  smiled.  \"Maybe  you  didn't\nnotice,  but  there  are  three  of  us  and\ntwo of you.\"<br><br>   Hassan  shrugged.  To  an  outsider,\nhe  didn't  look  scared.  But  Hassan's\nface  was  my  earliest  memory  and  I\nknew  all  of  its  subtle  nuances,  knew\neach and every twitch and flicker that\never rippled across it. And I saw that\nhe  was  scared.  He  was  scared\nplenty.<br><br>   \"You  are  right,  Agha.  But  perhaps\nyou  didn't  notice  that  I'm  the  one\nholding  the  slingshot.  If  you  make  a\nmove,  they'll  have  to  change  your", "nickname  from  Assef  'the  Ear  Eater'\nto  'One-Eyed  Assef,'  because  I  have\nthis rock pointed at \nyour  left  eye.\"  He  said  this  so  flatly\nthat  even  I  had  to  strain  to  hear  the\nfear  that  I  knew  hid  under  that  calm\nvoice.<br><br>   Assef's  mouth  twitched.  Wali  and\nKamal  watched  this  exchange  with\nsomething  akin  to  fascination.\nSomeone  had  challenged  their  god.\nHumiliated him. And, worst of all, that\nsomeone  was  a  skinny  Hazara.\nAssef  looked  from  the  rock  to\nHassan.  He  searched  Hassan's  face\nintently.  What  he  found  in  it  must\nhave  convinced  him  of  the\nseriousness  of  Hassan's  intentions,\nbecause he lowered his fist.<br><br> \"You should know something about\nme, Hazara,\" Assef said gravely. \"I'm\na  very  patient  person.  This  doesn't\nend today, believe me.\" He turned to\nme. \"This isn't the end for you either,\nAmir.  Someday,  I'll  make  you  face", "me  one  on  one.\"  Assef  retreated  a\nstep. His disciples followed.<br><br>   \"Your  Hazara  made  a  big  mistake\ntoday,  Amir,\"  he  said.  They  then\nturned  around,  walked  away.  I\nwatched them walk down the hill and\ndisappear behind a wall.<br><br>   Hassan  was  trying  to  tuck  the\nslingshot  in  his  waist  with  a  pair  of\ntrembling hands. His mouth curled up\ninto something that was supposed to\nbe a reassuring smile. It took him five\ntries  to  tie  the  string  of  his  trousers.\nNeither  one  of  us  said  much  of\nanything  as  we  walked  home  in\ntrepidation, certain that Assef and his\nfriends  would  ambush  us  every  time\nwe  turned  a  corner.  They  didn't  and\nthat should have comforted us a little.\nBut it didn't. Not at all.<br><br>\nFOR  THE  NEXT  COUPLE  of  years,\nthe  words  economic  development", "and  reform  danced  on  a  lot  of  lips  in\nKabul.  The  constitutional  monarchy\nhad  been  abolished,  replaced  by  a\nrepublic,  led  by  a  president  of  the\nrepublic.  For  a  while,  a  sense  of\nrejuvenation  and  purpose  swept\nacross  the  land.  People  spoke  of\nwomen's  rights  and  modern\ntechnology.<br><br> And for the most part, even though\na  new  leader  lived  in  Arg--the  royal\npalace  in  Kabul--life  went  on  as\nbefore.  People  went  to  work\nSaturday  through  Thursday  and\ngathered  for  picnics  on  Fridays  in\nparks,  on  the  banks  of  Ghargha\nLake,  in  the  gardens  of  Paghman.\nMulticolored  buses  and  lorries  filled\nwith  passengers  rolled  through  the\nnarrow  streets  of  Kabul,  led  by  the\nconstant \nshouts  of  the  driver  assistants  who\nstraddled  the  vehicles'  rear  bumpers\nand  yelped  directions  to  the  driver  in\ntheir thick Kabuli accent. On Eid, the\nthree  days  of  celebration  after  the", "holy  month  of  Ramadan,  Kabulis\ndressed  in  their  best  and  newest\nclothes  and  visited  their  families.\nPeople  hugged  and  kissed  and\ngreeted  each  other  with  \"Eid\nMubarak.\"  Happy  Eid.  Children\nopened  gifts  and  played  with  dyed\nhard-boiled eggs.<br><br>   Early  that  following  winter  of  1974,\nHassan  and  I  were  playing  in  the\nyard  one  day,  building  a  snow  fort,\nwhen  Ali  called  him  in.  \"Hassan,\nAgha sahib wants to talk to you!\" He\nwas  standing  by  the  front  door,\ndressed in white, hands tucked under\nhis  armpits,  breath  puffing  from  his\nmouth.<br><br>   Hassan  and  I  exchanged  a  smile.\nWe'd been waiting for his call all day:\nIt was Hassan's birthday. \"What is it,\nFather,  do  you  know?  Will  you  tell\nus?\"  Hassan  said.  His  eyes  were\ngleaming.<br><br>   Ali  shrugged.  \"Agha  sahib  hasn't", "discussed it with me.\"<br><br> \"Come on, Ali, tell us,\" I pressed. \"Is\nit  a  drawing  book?  Maybe  a  new\npistol?\"<br><br>   Like  Hassan,  Ali  was  incapable  of\nlying. Every year, he pretended not to\nknow what Baba had bought Hassan\nor  me  for  our  birthdays.  And  every\nyear,  his  eyes  betrayed  him  and  we\ncoaxed  the  goods  out  of  him.  This\ntime,  though,  it  seemed  he  was\ntelling the truth.<br><br>   Baba  never  missed  Hassan's\nbirthday. For a while, he used to ask\nHassan what he wanted, but he gave\nup  doing  that  because  Hassan  was\nalways  too  modest  to  actually\nsuggest  a  present.  So  every  winter\nBaba  picked  something  out  himself.\nHe  bought  him  a  Japanese  toy  truck\none  year,  an  electric  locomotive  and\ntrain  track  set  another  year.  The\nprevious  year,  Baba  had  surprised\nHassan  with  a  leather  cowboy  hat", "just like the one Clint Eastwood wore\nin  The  Good,  the  Bad,  and  the\nUgly--which  had  unseated  The\nMagnificent  Seven  as  our  favorite\nWestern.  That  whole  winter,  Hassan\nand I took turns wearing the hat, and\nbelted out the film's famous music as\nwe  climbed  mounds  of  snow  and\nshot each other dead.<br><br> We took off our gloves and removed\nour  snow-laden  boots  at  the  front\ndoor.  When  we  stepped  into  the\nfoyer,  we  found  Baba  sitting  by  the\nwood-\nburning  cast-iron  stove  with  a  short,\nbalding  Indian  man  dressed  in  a\nbrown suit and red tie.<br><br> \"Hassan,\" Baba said, smiling coyly,\n\"meet your birthday present.\"<br><br>   Hassan  and  I  traded  blank  looks.\nThere  was  no  gift-wrapped  box  in\nsight.  No  bag.  No  toy.  Just  Ali\nstanding  behind  us,  and  Baba  with\nthis slight Indian fellow who looked a", "little like a mathematics teacher.<br><br>   The  Indian  man  in  the  brown  suit\nsmiled and offered Hassan his hand.\n\"I  am  Dr.  Kumar,\"  he  said.  \"It's  a\npleasure  to  meet  you.\"  He  spoke\nFarsi  with  a  thick,  rolling  Hindi\naccent.<br><br>   \"Salaam  alaykum,\"  Hassan  said\nuncertainly.  He  gave  a  polite  tip  of\nthe  head,  but  his  eyes  sought  his\nfather  behind  him.  Ali  moved  closer\nand  set  his  hand  on  Hassan's\nshoulder.<br><br>   Baba  met  Hassan's  wary--and\npuzzled--eyes.  \"I  have  summoned\nDr.  Kumar  from  New  Delhi.  Dr.\nKumar is a plastic surgeon.\"<br><br>   \"Do  you  know  what  that  is?\"  the\nIndian man--Dr. Kumar--said.<br><br> Hassan shook his head. He looked\nto  me  for  help  but  I  shrugged.  All  I\nknew was that you went to a surgeon", "to fix you when you had appendicitis.\nI  knew  this  because  one  of  my\nclassmates  had  died  of  it  the  year\nbefore  and  the  teacher  had  told  us\nthey had waited too long to take him\nto  a  surgeon.  We  both  looked  to  Ali,\nbut  of  course  with  him  you  could\nnever tell. His face was impassive as\never,  though  something  sober  had\nmelted into his eyes.<br><br> \"Well,\" Dr. Kumar said, \"my job is to\nfix  things  on  people's  bodies.\nSometimes their faces.\"<br><br>   \"Oh,\"  Hassan  said.  He  looked  from\nDr.  Kumar  to  Baba  to  Ali.  His  hand\ntouched  his  upper  lip.  \"Oh,\"  he  said\nagain. <br><br>   \"It's  an  unusual  present,  I  know,\"\nBaba  said.  \"And  probably  not  what\nyou had in mind, but this present will\nlast you forever.\"<br><br>   \"Oh,\"  Hassan  said.  He  licked  his\nlips.  Cleared  his  throat.  \"Agha  sahib,\nwill it... will it--\" ", "    \"Nothing  doing,\"  Dr.  Kumar\nintervened,  smiling  kindly.  \"It  will  not\nhurt  you  one  bit.  In  fact,  I  will  give\nyou  a  medicine  and  you  will  not\nremember a thing.\"<br><br> \"Oh,\" Hassan said. He smiled back\nwith  relief.  A  little  relief  anyway.  \"I\nwasn't  scared,  Agha  sahib,  I  just...\"\nHassan might have been fooled, but I\nwasn't. I knew that when doctors said\nit wouldn't hurt, that's when you knew\nyou  were  in  trouble.  With  dread,  I\nremembered  my  circumcision  the\nyear  prior.  The  doctor  had  given  me\nthe  same  line,  reassured  me  it\nwouldn't  hurt  one  bit.  But  when  the\nnumbing  medicine  wore  off  later  that\nnight,  it  felt  like  someone  had\npressed  a  red  hot  coal  to  my  loins.\nWhy  Baba  waited  until  I  was  ten  to\nhave  me  circumcised  was  beyond\nme and one of the things I will never\nforgive him for.<br><br> I wished I too had some kind of scar", "that would beget Baba's sympathy. It\nwasn't  fair.  Hassan  hadn't  done\nanything  to  earn  Baba's  affections;\nhe'd  just  been  born  with  that  stupid\nharelip.<br><br> The surgery went well. We were all\na  little  shocked  when  they  first\nremoved  the  bandages,  but  kept  our\nsmiles  on  just  as  Dr.  Kumar  had\ninstructed us. It wasn't easy, because\nHassan's  upper  lip  was  a  grotesque\nmesh  of  swollen,  raw  tissue.  I\nexpected  Hassan  to  cry  with  horror\nwhen  the  nurse  handed  him  the\nmirror.  Ali  held  his  hand  as  Hassan\ntook a long, thoughtful look into it. He\nmuttered  something  I  didn't\nunderstand.  I  put  my  ear  to  his\nmouth. He whispered it again.<br><br> \"Tashakor.\" Thank you.<br><br> Then his lips twisted, and, that time,\nI  knew  just  what  he  was  doing.  He\nwas  smiling.  Just  as  he  had,\nemerging from his mother's womb. ", "    The  swelling  subsided,  and  the\nwound healed with time. Soon, it was\njust  a  pink  jagged  line  running  up\nfrom his lip. By the following winter, it\nwas only a \nfaint scar. Which was ironic. Because\nthat  was  the  winter  that  Hassan\nstopped smiling.", "#$#$Chapter 6#$#$<br><br>Winter.<br><br> Here is what I do on the first day of\nsnowfall every year: I step out of the\nhouse early in the morning, still in my\npajamas,  hugging  my  arms  against\nthe  chill.  I  find  the  driveway,  my\nfather's  car,  the  walls,  the  trees,  the\nrooftops, and the hills buried under a\nfoot  of  snow.  I  smile.  The  sky  is\nseamless  and  blue,  the  snow  so\nwhite  my  eyes  burn.  I  shovel  a\nhandful  of  the  fresh  snow  into  my\nmouth,  listen  to  the  muffled  stillness\nbroken only by the cawing of crows.

The  reason  was", "simple:  They  shut  down  school  for\nthe icy season. Winter to me was the\nend  of  long  division  and  naming  the\ncapital  of  Bulgaria,  and  the  start  of\nthree months of playing cards by the\nstove  with  Hassan,  free  Russian\nmovies  on  Tuesday  mornings  at\nCinema  Park,  sweet  turnip  qurma\nover rice for lunch after a morning of\nbuilding snowmen.<br><br>   And  kites,  of  course.  Flying  kites.\nAnd running them.<br><br>   For  a  few  unfortunate  kids,  winter\ndid  not  spell  the  end  of  the  school\nyear.  There  were  the  so-called\nvoluntary  winter  courses.  No  kid  I\nknew ever volunteered to go to these\nclasses;  parents,  of  course,  did  the\nvolunteering for them. Fortunately for\nme,  Baba  was  not  one  of  them.  I\nremember one kid, Ahmad, who lived\nacross  the  street  from  us.  His  father\nwas some kind of doctor, I \nthink.  Ahmad  had  epilepsy  and\nalways  wore  a  wool  vest  and  thick", "black-rimmed glasses--he was one of\nAssef's  regular  victims.  Every\nmorning, I watched from my bedroom\nwindow  as  their  Hazara  servant\nshoveled  snow  from  the  driveway,\ncleared  the  way  for  the  black  Opel.  I\nmade a point of watching Ahmad and\nhis  father  get  into  the  car,  Ahmad  in\nhis  wool  vest  and  winter  coat,  his\nschoolbag  filled  with  books  and\npencils.  I  waited  until  they  pulled\naway,  turned  the  corner,  then  I\nslipped  back  into  bed  in  my  flannel\npajamas.  I  pulled  the  blanket  to  my\nchin  and  watched  the  snowcapped\nhills in the north through the window.\nWatched  them  until  I  drifted  back  to\nsleep.<br><br> I loved wintertime in Kabul. I loved it\nfor the soft pattering of snow against\nmy window at night, for the way fresh\nsnow  crunched  under  my  black\nrubber  boots,  for  the  warmth  of  the\ncast-iron  stove  as  the  wind\nscreeched  through  the  yards,  the\nstreets.  But  mostly  because,  as  the", "trees  froze  and  ice  sheathed  the\nroads,  the  chill  between  Baba  and\nme thawed a little. And the reason for\nthat was the kites. Baba and I lived in\nthe  same  house,  but  in  different\nspheres  of  existence.  Kites  were  the\none  paper  thin  slice  of  intersection\nbetween those spheres.<br><br>\nEVERY  WINTER,  districts  in  Kabul\nheld a kite-fighting tournament. And if\nyou  were  a  boy  living  in  Kabul,  the\nday  of  the  tournament  was\nundeniably  the  highlight  of  the  cold\nseason. I never slept the night before\nthe  tournament.  I'd  roll  from  side  to\nside,  make  shadow  animals  on  the\nwall,  even  sit  on  the  balcony  in  the\ndark, a blanket wrapped around me. I\nfelt like a soldier trying to sleep in the\ntrenches  the  night  before  a  major\nbattle.  And  that  wasn't  so  far  off.  In\nKabul,  fighting  kites  was  a  little  like\ngoing to war. ", "    As  with  any  war,  you  had  to  ready\nyourself  for  battle.  For  a  while,\nHassan  and  I  used  to  build  our  own\nkites.  We  saved  our  weekly\nallowances  in  the  fall,  dropped  the\nmoney  in  a  little  porcelain  horse\nBaba  had  brought  one  time  from\nHerat.  When  the  winds  of  winter\nbegan  to  blow  and  snow  fell  in\nchunks, we undid the snap under the\nhorse's  belly.  We  went  to  the  bazaar\nand bought bamboo, glue, string, and\npaper.  We  spent  hours  every  day\nshaving  bamboo  for  the  center  and\ncross  spars,  cutting  the  thin  tissue\npaper  which  made  for  easy  dipping\nand recovery And then, of course, we\nhad to make our own string, or tar. If\nthe  kite  was  the  gun,  then  tar,  the\nglass-coated  cutting  line,  was  the\nbullet in the chamber. We'd go out in\nthe yard and feed up to five hundred\nfeet  of  string  through  a  mixture  of\nground  glass  and  glue.  We'd  then\nhang  the  line  between  the  trees,\nleave  it  to  dry.  The  next  day,  we'd\nwind  the  battle-ready  line  around  a", "wooden  spool.  By  the  time  the  snow\nmelted  and  the  rains  of  spring  swept\nin,  every  boy  in  Kabul  bore  telltale\nhorizontal gashes on his fingers from\na whole \nwinter  of  fighting  kites.  I  remember\nhow  my  classmates  and  I  used  to\nhuddle,  compare  our  battle  scars  on\nthe first day of school. The cuts stung\nand didn't heal for a couple of weeks,\nbut  I  didn't  mind.  They  were\nreminders  of  a  beloved  season  that\nhad  once  again  passed  too  quickly.\nThen  the  class  captain  would  blow\nhis  whistle  and  we'd  march  in  a\nsingle  file  to  our  classrooms,  longing\nfor winter already, greeted instead by\nthe  specter  of  yet  another  long\nschool year.<br><br> But it quickly became apparent that\nHassan and I were better kite fighters\nthan kite makers. Some flaw or other\nin  our  design  always  spelled  its\ndoom.  So  Baba  started  taking  us  to\nSaifo's  to  buy  our  kites.  Saifo  was  a\nnearly  blind  old  man  who  was  a", "moochi  by  profession--a  shoe\nrepairman. But he was also the city's\nmost famous kite maker, working out\nof  a  tiny  hovel  on  Jadeh  Maywand,\nthe  crowded  street  south  of  the\nmuddy  banks  of  the  Kabul  River.  I\nremember you had to crouch to enter\nthe  prison  cell-sized  store,  and  then\nhad to lift a trapdoor to creep down a\nset  of  wooden  steps  to  the  dank\nbasement  where  Saifo  stored  his\ncoveted  kites.  Baba  would  buy  us\neach  three  identical  kites  and  spools\nof glass string. If I changed my mind\nand  asked  for  a  bigger  and  fancier\nkite,  Baba  would  buy  it  for  me--but\nthen  he'd  buy  it  for  Hassan  too.\nSometimes  I  wished  he  wouldn't  do\nthat.  Wished  he'd  let  me  be  the\nfavorite.<br><br> The kite-fighting tournament was an\nold  winter  tradition  in  Afghanistan.  It\nstarted  early  in  the  morning  on  the\nday of the contest and didn't end until\nonly the winning kite flew in the sky--I\nremember  one  year  the  tournament", "outlasted  daylight.  People  gathered\non  sidewalks  and  roofs  to  cheer  for\ntheir  kids.  The  streets  filled  with  kite\nfighters,  jerking  and  tugging  on  their\nlines,  squinting  up  to  the  sky,  trying\nto gain position to cut the opponent's\nline.  Every  kite  fighter  had  an\nassistant--in  my  case,  Hassan--who\nheld the spool and fed the line.<br><br>   One  time,  a  bratty  Hindi  kid  whose\nfamily  had  recently  moved  into  the\nneighborhood  told  us  that  in  his\nhometown,  kite  fighting  had  strict\nrules  and  regulations.  \"You  have  to\nplay in a boxed area and you have to\nstand at a right angle to the wind,\" he\nsaid  proudly.  \"And  you  can't  use\naluminum to make your glass string.\"\nHassan  and  I  looked  at  each  other.\nCracked  up.  The  Hindi  kid  would\nsoon  learn  what  the  British  learned\nearlier  in  the  century,  and  what  the\nRussians  would  eventually  learn  by\nthe  late  1980s:  that  Afghans  are  an\nindependent people. Afghans cherish\ncustom  but  abhor  rules.  And  so  it", "was with kite fighting. The rules were\nsimple:  No  rules.  Fly  your  kite.  Cut\nthe opponents. Good luck.<br><br>   Except  that  wasn't  all.  The  real  fun\nbegan when a kite was cut. That was\nwhere  the  kite  runners  came  in,\nthose  kids  who  chased  the\nwindblown  kite  drifting  through  the\nneighborhoods  until  it  came  spiraling\ndown  in  a  field,  dropping  in\nsomeone's  yard,  on  a  tree,  or  a\nrooftop.  The  chase  got  pretty  fierce;\nhordes  of  kite  runners  swarmed  the\nstreets,  shoved  past  each  other  like\nthose \npeople  from  Spain  I'd  read  about\nonce,  the  ones  who  ran  from  the\nbulls.  One  year  a  neighborhood  kid\nclimbed  a  pine  tree  for  a  kite.  A\nbranch  snapped  under  his  weight\nand he fell thirty feet. Broke his back\nand  never  walked  again.  But  he  fell\nwith  the  kite  still  in  his  hands.  And\nwhen a kite runner had his hands on\na kite, no one could take it from him.\nThat wasn't a rule. That was custom. ", "    For  kite  runners,  the  most  coveted\nprize  was  the  last  fallen  kite  of  a\nwinter tournament. It was a trophy of\nhonor,  something  to  be  displayed  on\na mantle for guests to admire. When\nthe  sky  cleared  of  kites  and  only  the\nfinal  two  remained,  every  kite  runner\nreadied  himself  for  the  chance  to\nland this prize. He positioned himself\nat  a  spot  that  he  thought  would  give\nhim  a  head  start.  Tense  muscles\nreadied  themselves  to  uncoil.  Necks\ncraned.  Eyes  crinkled.  Fights  broke\nout.  And  when  the  last  kite  was  cut,\nall hell broke loose.<br><br>   Over  the  years,  I  had  seen  a  lot  of\nguys  run  kites.  But  Hassan  was  by\nfar  the  greatest  kite  runner  I'd  ever\nseen. It was downright eerie the way\nhe  always  got  to  the  spot  the  kite\nwould  land  before  the  kite  did,  as  if\nhe had some sort of inner compass.<br><br>   I  remember  one  overcast  winter\nday,  Hassan  and  I  were  running  a", "kite.  I  was  chasing  him  through\nneighborhoods,  hopping  gutters,\nweaving  through  narrow  streets.  I\nwas  a  year  older  than  him,  but\nHassan  ran  faster  than  I  did,  and  I\nwas falling behind.<br><br>   \"Hassan!  Wait!\"  I  yelled,  my\nbreathing hot and ragged.<br><br>   He  whirled  around,  motioned  with\nhis  hand.  \"This  way!\"  he  called\nbefore  dashing  around  another\ncorner.  I  looked  up,  saw  that  the\ndirection  we  were  running  was\nopposite  to  the  one  the  kite  was\ndrifting.<br><br>   \"We're  losing  it!  We're  going  the\nwrong way!\" I cried out.<br><br>   \"Trust  me!\"  I  heard  him  call  up\nahead. I reached the corner and saw\nHassan bolting along, his head down,\nnot  even  looking  at  the  sky,  sweat\nsoaking through the back of his shirt.\nI tripped over a rock and fell--I wasn't", "just slower than Hassan but clumsier\ntoo;  I'd  always  envied  his  natural\nathieticism.  When  I  staggered  to  my\nfeet,  I  caught  a  glimpse  of  Hassan\ndisappearing  around  another  street\ncorner. I hobbled after him, spikes of\npain battering my scraped knees.<br><br>  I saw we had ended up on a rutted\ndirt road near Isteqial Middle School.\nThere was a field on one side where\nlettuce  grew  in  the  summer,  and  a\nrow of sour cherry trees on the other.\nI  found  Hassan  sitting  cross-legged\nat the foot of one of the trees, eating\nfrom a fistful of dried mulberries.<br><br> \"What are we doing here?\" I panted,\nmy stomach roiling with nausea.<br><br> He smiled. \"Sit with me, Amir agha.\"\n  I dropped next to him, lay on a thin\npatch  of  snow,  wheezing.  \"You're\nwasting  our  time.  It  was  going  the\nother way, didn't you see?\" ", "    Hassan  popped  a  mulberry  in  his\nmouth.  \"It's  coming,\"  he  said.  I  could\nhardly  breathe  and  he  didn't  even\nsound tired.<br><br> \"How do you know?\" I said.<br><br> \"I know.\"<br><br> \"How can you know?\"<br><br>   He  turned  to  me.  A  few  sweat\nbeads  rolled  from  his  bald  scalp.\n\"Would I ever lie to you, Amir agha?\"<br><br> Suddenly I decided to toy with him a\nlittle. \"I don't know. Would you?\"<br><br>   \"I'd  sooner  eat  dirt,\"  he  said  with  a\nlook of indignation.<br><br> \"Really? You'd do that?\" <br><br>   He  threw  me  a  puzzled  look.  \"Do\nwhat?\"<br><br>   \"Eat  dirt  if  I  told  you  to,\"  I  said.  I\nknew I was being cruel, like when I'd", "taunt  him  if  he  didn't  know  some  big\nword.  But  there  was  something\nfascinating--albeit  in  a  sick\nway--about  teasing  Hassan.  Kind  of\nlike  when  we  used  to  play  insect\ntorture.  Except  now,  he  was  the  ant\nand  I  was  holding  the  magnifying\nglass.<br><br>   His  eyes  searched  my  face  for  a\nlong  time.  We  sat  there,  two  boys\nunder  a  sour  cherry  tree,  suddenly\nlooking, really looking, at each other.\nThat's  when  it  happened  again:\nHassan's  face  changed.  Maybe  not\nchanged,  not  really,  but  suddenly  I\nhad  the  feeling  I  was  looking  at  two\nfaces,  the  one  I  knew,  the  one  that\nwas my first memory, and another, a\nsecond  face,  this  one  lurking  just\nbeneath  the  surface.  I'd  seen  it\nhappen  before--it  always  shook  me\nup a little. It just appeared, this other\nface, for a fraction of a moment, long\nenough  to  leave  me  with  the\nunsettling feeling that maybe I'd seen\nit  someplace  before.  Then  Hassan", "blinked  and  it  was  just  him  again.\nJust Hassan.<br><br>   \"If  you  asked,  I  would,\"  he  finally\nsaid,  looking  right  at  me.  I  dropped\nmy eyes. To this day, I find it hard to\ngaze  directly  at  people  like  Hassan,\npeople  who  mean  every  word  they\nsay.<br><br>   \"But  I  wonder,\"  he  added.  \"Would\nyou  ever  ask  me  to  do  such  a  thing,\nAmir  agha?\"  And,  just  like  that,  he\nhad thrown at me his own little test. If\nI  was  going  to  toy  with  him  and\nchallenge  his  loyalty,  then  he'd  toy\nwith me, test my integrity.<br><br>   I  wished  I  hadn't  started  this\nconversation. I forced a smile. \"Don't\nbe  stupid,  Hassan.  You  know  I\nwouldn't.\"<br><br>   Hassan  returned  the  smile.  Except\nhis  didn't  look  forced.  \"I  know,\"  he\nsaid.  And  that's  the  thing  about\npeople  who  mean  everything  they", "say.  They  think  everyone  else  does\ntoo.<br><br>   \"Here  it  comes,\"  Hassan  said,\npointing  to  the  sky.  He  rose  to  his\nfeet  and  walked  a  few  paces  to  his\nleft.  I  looked  up,  saw  the  kite\nplummeting toward us. <br><br>   I  heard  footfalls,  shouts,  an\napproaching  melee  of  kite  runners.\nBut  they  were  wasting  their  time.\nBecause Hassan stood with his arms\nwide  open,  smiling,  waiting  for  the\nkite.  And  may  God--if  He  exists,  that\nis--strike me blind if the kite didn't just\ndrop into his outstretched arms.<br><br>\nIN  THE  WINTER  OF  1975,  I  saw\nHassan run a kite for the last time.<br><br> Usually, each neighborhood held its\nown  competition.  But  that  year,  the\ntournament  was  going  to  be  held  in\nmy neighborhood, Wazir Akbar Khan,\nand  several  other", "districts--Karteh-Char,\nKarteh-Parwan,  Mekro-Rayan,  and\nKoteh-Sangi--had  been  invited.  You\ncould  hardly  go  anywhere  without\nhearing  talk  of  the  upcoming\ntournament.  Word  had  it  this  was\ngoing to be the biggest tournament in\ntwenty-five years.<br><br>   One  night  that  winter,  with  the  big\ncontest  only  four  days  away,  Baba\nand  I  sat  in  his  study  in  overstuffed\nleather  chairs  by  the  glow  of  the\nfireplace.  We  were  sipping  tea,\ntalking.  Ali  had  served  dinner\nearlier--potatoes  and  curried\ncauliflower  over  rice--and  had  retired\nfor  the  night  with  Hassan.  Baba  was\nfattening  his  pipe  and  I  was  asking\nhim to tell the story about the winter a\npack  of  wolves  had  descended  from\nthe  mountains  in  Herat  and  forced\neveryone  to  stay  indoors  for  a  week,\nwhen  he  lit  a  match  and  said,\ncasually, \"I think maybe you'll win the\ntournament  this  year.  What  do  you\nthink?\" ", "  I didn't know what to think. Or what\nto  say.  Was  that  what  it  would  take?\nHad he just slipped me a key? I was\na  good  kite  fighter.  Actually,  a  very\ngood one. A few times, I'd even come\nclose  to  winning  the  winter\ntournament--once,  I'd  made  it  to  the\nfinal  three.  But  coming  close  wasn't\nthe  same  as  winning,  was  it?  Baba\nhadn't  come  close.  He  had  won\nbecause  winners  won  and  everyone\nelse just went home. Baba was used\nto  winning,  winning  at  everything  he\nset his mind to. Didn't he have a right\nto  expect  the  same  from  his  son?\nAnd just imagine. If I did win...<br><br> Baba smoked his pipe and talked. I\npretended  to  listen.  But  I  couldn't\nlisten,  not  really,  because  Baba's\ncasual  little  comment  had  planted  a\nseed in my head: the resolution that I\nwould  win  that  winter's  tournament.  I\nwas going to win. There was no other\nviable option. I was going to win, and\nI was going to run that last kite. Then", "I'd bring it home and show it to Baba.\nShow  him  once  and  for  all  that  his\nson was worthy. Then maybe my life\nas a ghost in this house would finally\nbe  over.  I  let  myself  dream:  I\nimagined  conversation  and  laughter\nover \ndinner instead of silence broken only\nby  the  clinking  of  silverware  and  the\noccasional  grunt.  I  envisioned  us\ntaking a Friday drive in Baba's car to\nPaghman,  stopping  on  the  way  at\nGhargha  Lake  for  some  fried  trout\nand  potatoes.  We'd  go  to  the  zoo  to\nsee Marjan the lion, and maybe Baba\nwouldn't  yawn  and  steal  looks  at  his\nwristwatch  all  the  time.  Maybe  Baba\nwould  even  read  one  of  my  stories.\nI'd  write  him  a  hundred  if  I  thought\nhe'd  read  one.  Maybe  he'd  call  me\nAmir  jan  like  Rahim  Khan  did.  And\nmaybe, just maybe, I would finally be\npardoned for killing my mother.<br><br> Baba was telling me about the time\nhe'd  cut  fourteen  kites  on  the  same\nday.  I  smiled,  nodded,  laughed  at  all", "the  right  places,  but  I  hardly  heard  a\nword  he  said.  I  had  a  mission  now.\nAnd  I  wasn't  going  to  fail  Baba.  Not\nthis time.<br><br>\nIT  SNOWED  HEAVILY  the  night\nbefore the tournament. Hassan and I\nsat  under  the  kursi  and  played\npanjpar as wind-rattled tree branches\ntapped  on  the  window.  Earlier  that\nday,  I'd  asked  Ali  to  set  up  the  kursi\nfor  us--which  was  basically  an\nelectric  heater  under  a  low  table\ncovered with a thick, quilted blanket.<br><br>   Around  the  table,  he  arranged\nmattresses  and  cushions,  so  as\nmany as twenty people could sit and\nslip  their  legs  under.  Hassan  and  I\nused  to  spend  entire  snowy  days\nsnug  under  the  kursi,  playing  chess,\ncards--mostly panjpar.<br><br>   I  killed  Hassan's  ten  of  diamonds,\nplayed him two jacks and a six. Next", "door,  in  Baba's  study,  Baba  and\nRahim  Khan  were  discussing\nbusiness  with  a  couple  of  other\nmen-one  of  them  I  recognized  as\nAssef's  father.  Through  the  wall,  I\ncould  hear  the  scratchy  sound  of\nRadio Kabul News.<br><br> Hassan killed the six and picked up\nthe jacks. On the radio, Daoud Khan\nwas  announcing  something  about\nforeign investments.<br><br>   \"He  says  someday  we'll  have\ntelevision in Kabul,\" I said.<br><br> \"Who?\" <br><br>   \"Daoud  Khan,  you  ass,  the\npresident.\"<br><br>   Hassan  giggled.  \"I  heard  they\nalready  have  it  in  Iran,\"  he  said.  I\nsighed.  \"Those  Iranians...\"  For  a  lot\nof  Hazaras,  Iran  represented  a\nsanctuary  of  sorts--I  guess  because,\nlike  Hazaras,  most  Iranians  were\nShi'a  Muslims.  But  I  remembered", "something  my  teacher  had  said  that\nsummer  about  Iranians,  that  they\nwere  grinning  smooth  talkers  who\npatted you on the back with one hand\nand  picked  your  pocket  with  the\nother.  I  told  Baba  about  that  and  he\nsaid  my  teacher  was  one  of  those\njealous  Afghans,  jealous  because\nIran  was  a  rising  power  in  Asia  and\nmost  people  around  the  world\ncouldn't  even  find  Afghanistan  on  a\nworld  map.  \"It  hurts  to  say  that,\"  he\nsaid,  shrugging.  \"But  better  to  get\nhurt  by  the  truth  than  comforted  with\na lie.\"<br><br> \"I'll buy you one someday,\" I said.<br><br>   Hassan's  face  brightened.  \"A\ntelevision? In truth?\"<br><br>   \"Sure.  And  not  the  black-and-white\nkind  either.  We'll  probably  be\ngrown-ups by then, but I'll get us two.\nOne for you and one for me.\"<br><br> \"I'll put it on my table, where I keep", "my drawings,\" Hassan said.<br><br>   His  saying  that  made  me  kind  of\nsad. Sad for who Hassan was, where\nhe  lived.  For  how  he'd  accepted  the\nfact  that  he'd  grow  old  in  that  mud\nshack  in  the  yard,  the  way  his  father\nhad. I drew the last card, played him\na pair of queens and a ten.<br><br> Hassan picked up the queens. \"You\nknow,  I  think  you're  going  to  make\nAgha sahib very proud tomorrow.\"<br><br> \"You think so?\"<br><br> \"Inshallah,\" he said. <br><br>   \"Inshallah,\"  I  echoed,  though  the\n\"God willing\" qualifier didn't sound as\nsincere  coming  from  my  lips.  That\nwas  the  thing  with  Hassan.  He  was\nso  goddamn  pure,  you  always  felt\nlike a phony around him.<br><br>   I  killed  his  king  and  played  him  my\nfinal card, the ace of spades. He had\nto pick it up. I'd won, but as I shuffled", "for  a  new  game,  I  had  the  distinct\nsuspicion  that  Hassan  had  let  me\nwin.<br><br> \"Amir agha?\"<br><br> \"What?\"<br><br> \"You know... I like where I live.\" He\nwas  always  doing  that,  reading  my\nmind.<br><br> \"It's my home.\"<br><br>   \"Whatever,\"  I  said.  \"Get  ready  to\nlose again.\"", "#$#$Chapter 7#$#$<br><br>The  next  morning,  as  he  brewed\nblack  tea  for  breakfast,  Hassan  told\nme  he'd  had  a  dream.  \"We  were  at\nGhargha  Lake,  you,  me,  Father,\nAgha  sahib,  Rahim  Khan,  and\nthousands  of  other  people,\"  he  said.\n\"It was warm and sunny, and the lake\nwas  clear  like  a  mirror.  But  no  one\nwas  swimming  because  they  said  a\nmonster had come to the lake. It was\nswimming at the bottom, waiting.\" <br><br>   He  poured  me  a  cup  and  added\nsugar,  blew  on  it  a  few  times.  Put  it\nbefore me. \"So everyone is scared to\nget  in  the  water,  and  suddenly  you\nkick  off  your  shoes,  Amir  agha,  and\ntake  off  your  shirt.  'There's  no\nmonster,'  you  say.  'I'll  show  you  all.'\nAnd before anyone can stop you, you\ndive  into  the  water,  start  swimming\naway.  I  follow  you  in  and  we're  both\nswimming.\" ", "  \"But you can't swim.\"<br><br> Hassan laughed. \"It's a dream, Amir\nagha,  you  can  do  anything.  Anyway,\neveryone is screaming, 'Get out! Get\nout!'  but  we  just  swim  in  the  cold\nwater.  We  make  it  way  out  to  the\nmiddle  of  the  lake  and  we  stop\nswimming. We turn toward the shore\nand  wave  to  the  people.  They  look\nsmall like ants, but we can hear them\nclapping.  They  see  now.  There  is  no\nmonster, just water. They change the\nname of the lake after that, and call it\nthe  'Lake  of  Amir  and  Hassan,\nSultans  of  Kabul,'  and  we  get  to\ncharge  people  money  for  swimming\nin it.\"<br><br> \"So what does it mean?\" I said.<br><br>   He  coated  my  naan  with\nmarmalade,  placed  it  on  a  plate.  \"I\ndon't  know.  I  was  hoping  you  could\ntell me.\"<br><br>   \"Well,  it's  a  dumb  dream.  Nothing", "happens in it.\"<br><br>   \"Father  says  dreams  always  mean\nsomething.\"<br><br>   I  sipped  some  tea.  \"Why  don't  you\nask him, then? He's so smart,\" I said,\nmore  curtly  than  I  had  intended.  I\nhadn't  slept  all  night.  My  neck  and\nback were like coiled springs, and my\neyes stung. Still, I had been mean to\nHassan.  I  almost  apologized,  then\ndidn't.  Hassan  understood  I  was  just\nnervous.  Hassan  always  understood\nabout me.<br><br>   Upstairs,  I  could  hear  the  water\nrunning in Baba's bathroom.<br><br> \nTHE  STREETS  GLISTENED  with\nfresh  snow  and  the  sky  was  a\nblameless  blue.  Snow  blanketed\nevery  rooftop  and  weighed  on  the\nbranches  of  the  stunted  mulberry\ntrees that lined our street. Overnight,\nsnow  had  nudged  its  way  into  every", "crack  and  gutter.  I  squinted  against\nthe blinding white when Hassan and I\nstepped  through  the  wrought-iron\ngates. Ali shut the gates behind us. I\nheard  him  mutter  a  prayer  under  his\nbreath--he  always  said  a  prayer\nwhen his son left the house.<br><br>   I  had  never  seen  so  many  people\non  our  street.  Kids  were  flinging\nsnowballs,  squabbling,  chasing  one\nanother,  giggling.  Kite  fighters  were\nhuddling  with  their  spool  holders,\nmaking  last  minute  preparations.\nFrom  adjacent  streets,  I  could  hear\nlaughter  and  chatter.  Already,\nrooftops  were  jammed  with\nspectators  reclining  in  lawn  chairs,\nhot  tea  steaming  from  thermoses,\nand the music of Ahmad Zahir blaring\nfrom  cassette  players.  The\nimmensely popular Ahmad Zahir had\nrevolutionized  Afghan  music  and\noutraged  the  purists  by  adding\nelectric  guitars,  drums,  and  horns  to\nthe  traditional  tabla  and  harmonium;\non stage or at parties, he shirked the", "austere and nearly morose stance of\nolder  singers  and  actually  smiled\nwhen  he  sang--sometimes  even  at\nwomen.  I  turned  my  gaze  to  our\nrooftop, found Baba and Rahim Khan\nsitting  on  a  bench,  both  dressed  in\nwool  sweaters,  sipping  tea.  Baba\nwaved. I couldn't tell if he was waving\nat me or Hassan.<br><br>   \"We  should  get  started,\"  Hassan\nsaid.  He  wore  black  rubber  snow\nboots and a bright green chapan over\na  thick  sweater  and  faded  corduroy\npants. Sunlight washed over his face,\nand,  in  it,  I  saw  how  well  the  pink\nscar above his lip had healed.<br><br>   Suddenly  I  wanted  to  withdraw.\nPack  it  all  in,  go  back  home.  What\nwas  I  thinking?  Why  was  I  putting\nmyself  through  this,  when  I  already\nknew the outcome? Baba was on the\nroof,  watching  me.  I  felt  his  glare  on\nme  like  the  heat  of  a  blistering  sun.\nThis  would  be  failure  on  a  grand\nscale, even for me. ", "    \"I'm  not  sure  I  want  to  fly  a  kite\ntoday,\" I said.<br><br> \"It's a beautiful day,\" Hassan said.<br><br>   I  shifted  on  my  feet.  Tried  to  peel\nmy  gaze  away  from  our  rooftop.  \"I\ndon't  know.  Maybe  we  should  go\nhome.\" <br><br> Then he stepped toward me and, in\na  low  voice,  said  something  that\nscared  me  a  little.  \"Remember,  Amir\nagha.  There's  no  monster,  just  a\nbeautiful  day.\"  How  could  I  be  such\nan  open  book  to  him  when,  half  the\ntime,  I  had  no  idea  what  was  milling\naround  in  his  head?  I  was  the  one\nwho  went  to  school,  the  one  who\ncould  read,  write.  I  was  the  smart\none.  Hassan  couldn't  read  a  first\ngrade  textbook  but  he'd  read  me\nplenty.  That  was  a  little  unsettling,\nbut  also  sort  of  comfortable  to  have\nsomeone who always knew what you\nneeded. ", "    \"No  monster,\"  I  said,  feeling  a  little\nbetter, to my own surprise.<br><br> He smiled. \"No monster.\"<br><br> \"Are you sure?\"<br><br> He closed his eyes. Nodded.<br><br>   I  looked  to  the  kids  scampering\ndown  the  street,  flinging  snowballs.\n\"It is a beautiful day, isn't it?\"<br><br> \"Let's fly,\" he said.<br><br>   It  occurred  to  me  then  that  maybe\nHassan  had  made  up  his  dream.\nWas  that  possible?  I  decided  it\nwasn't.  Hassan  wasn't  that  smart.  I\nwasn't  that  smart.  But  made  up  or\nnot, the silly dream had lifted some of\nmy  anxiety.  Maybe  I  should  take  off\nmy  shirt,  take  a  swim  in  the  lake.\nWhy not? \"Let's do it,\" I said.<br><br>   Hassan's  face  brightened.  \"Good,\"\nhe  said.  He  lifted  our  kite,  red  with", "yellow  borders,  and,  just  beneath\nwhere  the  central  and  cross  spars\nmet,  marked  with  Saifo's\nunmistakable signature. He licked his\nfinger and held it up, tested the wind,\nthen ran in its direction--on those rare\noccasions  we  flew  kites  in  the\nsummer,  he'd  kick  up  dust  to  see\nwhich  way  the  wind  blew  it.  The\nspool rolled in my hands until Hassan\nstopped,  about  fifty  feet  away.  He\nheld  the  kite  high  over  his  head,  like\nan  Olympic  athlete  showing  his  gold\nmedal.  I  jerked  the  string  twice,  our\nusual  signal,  and  Hassan  tossed  the\nkite. <br><br>   Caught  between  Baba  and  the\nmullahs  at  school,  I  still  hadn't  made\nup  my  mind  about  God.  But  when  a\nKoran  ayat  I  had  learned  in  my\ndiniyat  class  rose  to  my  lips,  I\nmuttered  it.  I  took  a  deep  breath,\nexhaled,  and  pulled  on  the  string.\nWithin  a  minute,  my  kite  was\nrocketing to the sky. It made a sound\nlike  a  paper  bird  flapping  its  wings.\nHassan  clapped  his  hands,  whistled,", "and ran back to me. I handed him the\nspool,  holding  on  to  the  string,  and\nhe  spun  it  quickly  to  roll  the  loose\nstring back on.<br><br>   At  least  two  dozen  kites  already\nhung  in  the  sky,  like  paper  sharks\nroaming for prey. Within an hour, the\nnumber  doubled,  and  red,  blue,  and\nyellow  kites  glided  and  spun  in  the\nsky.  A  cold  breeze  wafted  through\nmy hair. The wind was perfect for kite\nflying,  blowing  just  hard  enough  to\ngive  some  lift,  make  the  sweeps\neasier.  Next  to  me,  Hassan  held  the\nspool,  his  hands  already  bloodied  by\nthe string.<br><br>   Soon,  the  cutting  started  and  the\nfirst  of  the  defeated  kites  whirled  out\nof  control.  They  fell  from  the  sky  like\nshooting  stars  with  brilliant,  rippling\ntails,  showering  the  neighborhoods\nbelow with prizes for the kite runners.\nI  could  hear  the  runners  now,\nhollering  as  they  ran  the  streets.\nSomeone  shouted  reports  of  a  fight", "breaking out two streets down.<br><br>   I  kept  stealing  glances  at  Baba\nsitting  with  Rahim  Khan  on  the  roof,\nwondered what he was thinking. Was\nhe  cheering  for  me?  Or  did  a  part  of\nhim enjoy watching me fail? That was\nthe thing about kite flying: Your mind\ndrifted with the kite.<br><br> They were coming down all over the\nplace  now,  the  kites,  and  I  was  still\nflying. I was still flying. My eyes kept\nwandering  over  to  Baba,  bundled  up\nin  his  wool  sweater.  Was  he\nsurprised  I  had  lasted  as  long  as  I\nhad? You don't keep your eyes to the\nsky,  you  won't  last  much  longer.  I\nsnapped my gaze back to the sky. A\nred  kite  was  closing  in  on  me--I'd\ncaught  it  just  in  time.  I  tangled  a  bit\nwith  it,  ended  up  besting  him  when\nhe became impatient and tried to cut\nme from below.<br><br>   Up  and  down  the  streets,  kite\nrunners  were  returning  triumphantly,", "their  captured  kites  held  high.  They\nshowed  them  off  to  their  parents,\ntheir  friends.  But  they  all  knew  the\nbest  was  yet  to  come.  The  biggest\nprize  of  all  was  still  flying.  I  sliced  a\nbright  yellow  kite  with  a  coiled  white\ntail.  It  cost  me  another  gash  on  the'\nindex  finger  and  blood  trickled  down\ninto  my  palm.  I  had  Hassan  hold  the\nstring  and  sucked  the  blood  dry,\nblotted my finger against my jeans. <br><br> Within another hour, the number of\nsurviving  kites  dwindled  from  maybe\nfifty to a dozen. I was one of them. I'd\nmade it to the last dozen. I knew this\npart  of  the  tournament  would  take  a\nwhile,  because  the  guys  who  had\nlasted  this  long  were  good--they\nwouldn't  easily  fall  into  simple  traps\nlike  the  old  lift-and-dive,  Hassan's\nfavorite trick.<br><br> By three o'clock that afternoon, tufts\nof  clouds  had  drifted  in  and  the  sun\nhad  slipped  behind  them.  Shadows\nstarted  to  lengthen.  The  spectators\non  the  roofs  bundled  up  in  scarves", "and  thick  coats.  We  were  down  to  a\nhalf  dozen  and  I  was  still  flying.  My\nlegs  ached  and  my  neck  was  stiff.\nBut  with  each  defeated  kite,'  hope\ngrew in my heart, like snow collecting\non a wall, one flake at a time.<br><br> My eyes kept returning to a blue kite\nthat had been wreaking havoc for the\nlast hour.<br><br> \"How many has he cut?\" I asked.<br><br> \"I counted eleven,\" Hassan said.<br><br> \"Do you know whose it might be?\"<br><br>   Hassan  clucked  his  tongue  and\ntipped his chin. That was a trademark\nHassan  gesture,  meant  he  had  no\nidea. The blue kite sliced a big purple\none  and  swept  twice  in  big  loops.\nTen  minutes  later,  he'd  cut  another\ntwo,  sending  hordes  of  kite  runners\nracing after them.<br><br>   After  another  thirty  minutes,  only", "four  kites  remained.  And  I  was  still\nflying. It seemed I could hardly make\na  wrong  move,  as  if  every  gust  of\nwind  blew  in  my  favor.  I'd  never  felt\nso  in  command,  so  lucky  It  felt\nintoxicating.  I  didn't  dare  look  up  to\nthe roof. Didn't dare take my eyes off\nthe  sky.  I  had  to  concentrate,  play  it\nsmart.  Another  fifteen  minutes  and\nwhat  had  seemed  like  a  laughable\ndream  that  morning  had  suddenly\nbecome  reality:  It  was  just  me  and\nthe other guy. The blue kite.<br><br> The tension in the air was as taut as\nthe glass string I was tugging with my\nbloody hands. People were stomping\ntheir  feet,  clapping,  whistling,\nchanting,  \"Boboresh!  Boboresh!\"  Cut\nhim!  Cut  him!  I  wondered  if  Baba's\nvoice was one of \nthem.  Music  blasted.  The  smell  of\nsteamed  mantu  and  fried  pakora\ndrifted from rooftops and open doors.\n  But all I heard--all I willed myself to", "hear--was  the  thudding  of  blood  in\nmy head. All I saw was the blue kite.\nAll  I  smelled  was  victory.  Salvation.\nRedemption.  If  Baba  was  wrong  and\nthere  was  a  God  like  they  said  in\nschool,  then  He'd  let  me  win.  I  didn't\nknow what the other guy was playing\nfor,  maybe  just  bragging  rights.  But\nthis  was  my  one  chance  to  become\nsomeone  who  was  looked  at,  not\nseen,  listened  to,  not  heard.  If  there\nwas a God, He'd guide the winds, let\nthem  blow  for  me  so  that,  with  a  tug\nof  my  string,  I'd  cut  loose  my  pain,\nmy  longing.  I'd  endured  too  much,\ncome  too  far.  And  suddenly,  just  like\nthat, hope became knowledge. I was\ngoing  to  win.  It  was  just  a  matter  of\nwhen.<br><br> It turned out to be sooner than later.\nA  gust  of  wind  lifted  my  kite  and  I\ntook  advantage.  Fed  the  string,\npulled  up.  Looped  my  kite  on  top  of\nthe  blue  one.  I  held  position.  The\nblue  kite  knew  it  was  in  trouble.  It\nwas  trying  desperately  to  maneuver", "out  of  the  jam,  but  I  didn't  let  go.  I\nheld  position.  The  crowd  sensed  the\nend was at hand. The chorus of \"Cut\nhim!  Cut  him!\"  grew  louder,  like\nRomans chanting for the gladiators to\nkill, kill!<br><br>   \"You're  almost  there,  Amir  agha!\nAlmost there!\" Hassan was panting.<br><br>   Then  the  moment  came.  I  closed\nmy eyes and loosened my grip on the\nstring.  It  sliced  my  fingers  again  as\nthe  wind  dragged  it.  And  then...  I\ndidn't  need  to  hear  the  crowd's  roar\nto  know  I  didn't  need  to  see  either.\nHassan  was  screaming  and  his  arm\nwas wrapped around my neck.<br><br> \"Bravo! Bravo, Amir agha!\"<br><br> I opened my eyes, saw the blue kite\nspinning wildly like a tire come loose\nfrom  a  speeding  car.  I  blinked,  tried\nto say something. Nothing came out.\nSuddenly  I  was  hovering,  looking\ndown  on  myself  from  above.  Black", "leather coat, red scarf, faded jeans. A\nthin  boy,  a  little  sallow,  and  a  tad\nshort  for  his  twelve  years.  He  had\nnarrow  shoulders  and  a  hint  of  dark\ncircles  around  his  pale  hazel  eyes.\nThe  breeze  rustled  his  light  brown\nhair.  He  looked  up  to  me  and  we\nsmiled at each other.<br><br>   Then  I  was  screaming,  and\neverything  was  color  and  sound,\neverything was alive and good. I was\nthrowing my free arm around Hassan\nand we were \nhopping  up  and  down,  both  of  us\nlaughing,  both  of  us  weeping.  \"You\nwon, Amir agha! You won!\"<br><br> \"We won! We won!\" was all I could\nsay.  This  wasn't  happening.  In  a\nmoment, I'd blink and rouse from this\nbeautiful  dream,  get  out  of  bed,\nmarch  down  to  the  kitchen  to  eat\nbreakfast  with  no  one  to  talk  to  but\nHassan. Get dressed. Wait for Baba.\nGive  up.  Back  to  my  old  life.  Then  I\nsaw  Baba  on  our  roof.  He  was", "standing  on  the  edge,  pumping  both\nof  his  fists.  Hollering  and  clapping.\nAnd  that  right  there  was  the  single\ngreatest  moment  of  my  twelve  years\nof  life,  seeing  Baba  on  that  roof,\nproud of me at last.<br><br>   But  he  was  doing  something  now,\nmotioning with his hands in an urgent\nway.  Then  I  understood.  \"Hassan,\nwe--\"<br><br>   \"I  know,\"  he  said,  breaking  our\nembrace.  \"Inshallah,  we'll  celebrate\nlater. Right now, I'm going to run that\nblue  kite  for  you,\"  he  said.  He\ndropped  the  spool  and  took  off\nrunning, the hem of his green chapan\ndragging in the snow behind him.<br><br> \"Hassan!\" I called. \"Come back with\nit!\"<br><br>   He  was  already  turning  the  street\ncorner,  his  rubber  boots  kicking  up\nsnow.  He  stopped,  turned.  He\ncupped  his  hands  around  his  mouth.", "\"For  you  a  thousand  times  over!\"  he\nsaid.  Then  he  smiled  his  Hassan\nsmile  and  disappeared  around  the\ncorner. The next time I saw him smile\nunabashedly  like  that  was  twenty-six\nyears  later,  in  a  faded  Polaroid\nphotograph.<br><br>   I  began  to  pull  my  kite  back  as\npeople  rushed  to  congratulate  me.  I\nshook  hands  with  them,  said  my\nthanks.  The  younger  kids  looked  at\nme with an awestruck twinkle in their\neyes; I was a hero. Hands patted my\nback and tousled my hair. I pulled on\nthe  string  and  returned  every  smile,\nbut my mind was on the blue kite.<br><br>   Finally,  I  had  my  kite  in  hand.  I\nwrapped  the  loose  string  that  had\ncollected at my feet around the spool,\nshook a few more hands, and trotted\nhome.  When  I  reached  the\nwrought-iron  gates,  Ali  was  waiting\non  the  other  side.  He  stuck  his  hand\nthrough  the  bars.  \"Congratulations,\"\nhe said.  ", "  I gave him my kite and spool, shook\nhis hand. \"Tashakor, Ali jan.\"<br><br>   \"I  was  praying  for  you  the  whole\ntime.\"<br><br> \"Then keep praying. We're not done\nyet.\"<br><br>   I  hurried  back  to  the  street.  I  didn't\nask  Ali  about  Baba.  I  didn't  want  to\nsee  him  yet.  In  my  head,  I  had  it  all\nplanned:  I'd  make  a  grand  entrance,\na  hero,  prized  trophy  in  my  bloodied\nhands.  Heads  would  turn  and  eyes\nwould  lock.  Rostam  and  Sohrab\nsizing  each  other  up.  A  dramatic\nmoment  of  silence.  Then  the  old\nwarrior would walk to the young one,\nembrace  him,  acknowledge  his\nworthiness.  Vindication.  Salvation.\nRedemption.  And  then?  Well...\nhappily  ever  after,  of  course.  What\nelse?  The  streets  of  Wazir  Akbar\nKhan were numbered and set at right\nangles  to  each  other  like  a  grid.  It\nwas  a  new  neighborhood  then,  still", "developing,  with  empty  lots  of  land\nand half-constructed homes on every\nstreet  between  compounds\nsurrounded  by  eight-foot  walls.  I  ran\nup and down every street, looking for\nHassan.  Everywhere,  people  were\nbusy folding chairs, packing food and\nutensils  after  a  long  day  of  partying.\nSome,  still  sitting  on  their  rooftops,\nshouted their congratulations to me.<br><br>   Four  streets  south  of  ours,  I  saw\nOmar,  the  son  of  an  engineer  who\nwas  a  friend  of  Baba's.  He  was\ndribbling  a  soccer  ball  with  his\nbrother  on  the  front  lawn  of  their\nhouse. Omar was a pretty good guy.\nWe'd  been  classmates  in  fourth\ngrade, and one time he'd given me a\nfountain  pen,  the  kind  you  had  to\nload with a cartridge.<br><br>   \"I  heard  you  won,  Amir,\"  he  said.\n\"Congratulations.\"<br><br> \"Thanks. Have you seen Hassan?\" ", "  \"Your Hazara?\"<br><br> I nodded.<br><br> Omar headed the ball to his brother.\n\"I  hear  he's  a  great  kite  runner.\"  His\nbrother  headed  the  ball  back  to  him.\nOmar  caught  it,  tossed  it  up  and\ndown. \n\"Although  I've  always  wondered  how\nhe manages. I mean, with those tight\nlittle  eyes,  how  does  he  see\nanything?\"<br><br>   His  brother  laughed,  a  short  burst,\nand asked for the ball. Omar ignored\nhim.<br><br> \"Have you seen him?\"<br><br>   Omar  flicked  a  thumb  over  his\nshoulder,  pointing  southwest.  \"I  saw\nhim running toward the bazaar awhile\nago.\"<br><br> \"Thanks.\" I scuttled away. ", "    By  the  time  I  reached  the\nmarketplace,  the  sun  had  almost\nsunk  behind  the  hills  and  dusk  had\npainted  the  sky  pink  and  purple.  A\nfew  blocks  away,  from  the  Haji\nYaghoub  Mosque,  the  mullah\nbellowed  azan,  calling  for  the  faithful\nto  unroll  their  rugs  and  bow  their\nheads  west  in  prayer.  Hassan  never\nmissed  any  of  the  five  daily  prayers.\nEven when we were out playing, he'd\nexcuse  himself,  draw  water  from  the\nwell  in  the  yard,  wash  up,  and\ndisappear into the hut. He'd come out\na  few  minutes  later,  smiling,  find  me\nsitting against the wall or perched on\na  tree.  He  was  going  to  miss  prayer\ntonight, though, because of me.<br><br>   The  bazaar  was  emptying  quickly,\nthe  merchants  finishing  up  their\nhaggling  for  the  day.  I  trotted  in  the\nmud between rows of closely packed\ncubicles  where  you  could  buy  a\nfreshly  slaughtered  pheasant  in  one\nstand  and  a  calculator  from  the\nadjacent  one.  I  picked  my  way", "through  the  dwindling  crowd,  the\nlame  beggars  dressed  in  layers  of\ntattered  rags,  the  vendors  with  rugs\non  their  shoulders,  the  cloth\nmerchants and butchers closing shop\nfor  the  day.  I  found  no  sign  of\nHassan.<br><br>   I  stopped  by  a  dried  fruit  stand,\ndescribed Hassan to an old merchant\nloading  his  mule  with  crates  of  pine\nseeds and raisins. He wore a powder\nblue turban.<br><br> He paused to look at me for a long\ntime before answering. \"I might have\nseen him.\" <br><br> \"Which way did he go?\"<br><br> He eyed me up and down. \"What is\na boy like you doing here at this time\nof the day looking for a Hazara?\" His\nglance  lingered  admiringly  on  my\nleather  coat  and  my  jeans--cowboy\npants,  we  used  to  call  them.  In\nAfghanistan,  owning  anything\nAmerican,  especially  if  it  wasn't", "secondhand, was a sign of wealth.<br><br> \"I need to find him, Agha.\"<br><br> \"What is he to you?\" he said. I didn't\nsee  the  point  of  his  question,  but  I\nreminded  myself  that  impatience\nwasn't going to make him tell me any\nfaster.<br><br> \"He's our servant's son,\" I said.<br><br>   The  old  man  raised  a  pepper  gray\neyebrow.  \"He  is?  Lucky  Hazara,\nhaving such a concerned master. His\nfather  should  get  on  his  knees,\nsweep  the  dust  at  your  feet  with  his\neyelashes.\"<br><br> \"Are you going to tell me or not?\"<br><br>   He  rested  an  arm  on  the  mule's\nback, pointed south. \"I think I saw the\nboy  you  described  running  that  way.\nHe  had  a  kite  in  his  hand.  A  blue\none.\" ", "  \"He did?\" I said. For you a thousand\ntimes  over,  he'd  promised.  Good  old\nHassan.<br><br> Good old reliable Hassan. He'd kept\nhis  promise  and  run  the  last  kite  for\nme.<br><br> \"Of course, they've probably caught\nhim  by  now,\"  the  old  merchant  said,\ngrunting  and  loading  another  box  on\nthe mule's back.<br><br> \"Who?\"<br><br>     \"The  other  boys,\"  he  said.  \"The\nones  chasing  him.  They  were\ndressed  like  you.\"  He  glanced  to  the\nsky  and  sighed.  \"Now,  run  along,\nyou're making me late for nainaz.\"<br><br> But I was already scrambling down\nthe lane.<br><br> For the next few minutes, I scoured\nthe  bazaar  in  vain.  Maybe  the  old\nmerchant's  eyes  had  betrayed  him.\nExcept  he'd  seen  the  blue  kite.  The", "thought  of  getting  my  hands  on  that\nkite...  I  poked  my  head  behind  every\nlane, every shop. No sign of Hassan.<br><br> I had begun to worry that darkness\nwould  fall  before  I  found  Hassan\nwhen  I  heard  voices  from  up  ahead.\nI'd  reached  a  secluded,  muddy  road.\nIt ran perpendicular to the end of the\nmain  thoroughfare  bisecting  the\nbazaar. I turned onto the rutted track\nand  followed  the  voices.  My  boot\nsquished in mud with every step and\nmy  breath  puffed  out  in  white  clouds\nbefore  me.  The  narrow  path  ran\nparallel  on  one  side  to  a  snow-filled\nravine  through  which  a  stream  may\nhave  tumbled  in  the  spring.  To  my\nother  side  stood  rows  of\nsnow-burdened  cypress  trees\npeppered  among  flat-topped  clay\nhouses--no more than mud shacks in\nmost  cases--separated  by  narrow\nalleys.<br><br> I heard the voices again, louder this\ntime, coming from one of the alleys. I", "crept close to the mouth of the alley.\nHeld  my  breath.  Peeked  around  the\ncorner.<br><br>   Hassan  was  standing  at  the  blind\nend  of  the  alley  in  a  defiant  stance:\nfists  curled,  legs  slightly  apart.\nBehind  him,  sitting  on  piles  of  scrap\nand rubble, was the blue kite. My key\nto Baba's heart.<br><br>   Blocking  Hassan's  way  out  of  the\nalley  were  three  boys,  the  same\nthree  from  that  day  on  the  hill,  the\nday  after  Daoud  Khan's  coup,  when\nHassan  had  saved  us  with  his\nslingshot.  Wali  was  standing  on  one\nside,  Kamal  on  the  other,  and  in  the\nmiddle,  Assef.  I  felt  my  body  clench\nup, and something cold rippled up my\nspine.  Assef  seemed  relaxed,\nconfident.  He  was  twirling  his  brass\nknuckles.  The  other  two  guys  shifted\nnervously  on  their  feet,  looking  from\nAssef to Hassan, like they'd cornered\nsome  kind  of  wild  animal  that  only\nAssef could tame.  ", "    \"Where  is  your  slingshot,  Hazara?\"\nAssef  said,  turning  the  brass\nknuckles  in  his  hand.  \"What  was  it\nyou  said?  'They'll  have  to  call  you\nOne-Eyed  Assef.'  That's  right.\nOne-Eyed  Assef.  That  was  clever.\nReally clever. Then again, it's easy to\nbe  clever  when  you're  holding  a\nloaded weapon.\"<br><br> I realized I still hadn't breathed out. I\nexhaled,  slowly,  quietly.  I  felt\nparalyzed.  I  watched  them  close  in\non the boy I'd grown up with, the boy\nwhose  harelipped  face  had  been  my\nfirst memory.<br><br>   \"But  today  is  your  lucky  day,\nHazara,\" Assef said. He had his back\nto  me,  but  I  would  have  bet  he  was\ngrinning.  \"I'm  in  a  mood  to  forgive.\nWhat do you say to that, boys?\"<br><br>   \"That's  generous,\"  Kamal  blurted,\n\"Especially after the rude manners he\nshowed  us  last  time.\"  He  was  trying\nto sound like Assef, except there was", "a  tremor  in  his  voice.  Then  I\nunderstood:  He  wasn't  afraid  of\nHassan,  not  really.  He  was  afraid\nbecause  he  had  no  idea  what  Assef\nhad in mind.<br><br>   Assef  waved  a  dismissive  hand.\n\"Bakhshida.  Forgiven.  It's  done.\"  His\nvoice  dropped  a  little.  \"Of  course,\nnothing  is  free  in  this  world,  and  my\npardon comes with a small price.\"<br><br> \"That's fair,\" Kamal said.<br><br> \"Nothing is free,\" Wali added.<br><br> \"You're a lucky Hazara,\" Assef said,\ntaking  a  step  toward  Hassan.\n\"Because  today,  it's  only  going  to\ncost  you  that  blue  kite.  A  fair  deal,\nboys, isn't it?\"<br><br> \"More than fair,\" Kamal said.<br><br>   Even  from  where  I  was  standing,  I\ncould  see  the  fear  creeping  into\nHassan's  eyes,  but  he  shook  his", "head.  \"Amir  agha  won  the\ntournament and I ran this kite for him.\nI ran it fairly. This is his kite.\" <br><br>   \"A  loyal  Hazara.  Loyal  as  a  dog,\"\nAssef  said.  Kamal's  laugh  was  a\nshrill, nervous sound.<br><br> \"But before you sacrifice yourself for\nhim,  think  about  this:  Would  he  do\nthe  same  for  you?  Have  you  ever\nwondered why he never includes you\nin  games  when  he  has  guests?  Why\nhe  only  plays  with  you  when  no  one\nelse  is  around?  I'll  tell  you  why,\nHazara.  Because  to  him,  you're\nnothing  but  an  ugly  pet.  Something\nhe  can  play  with  when  he's  bored,\nsomething  he  can  kick  when  he's\nangry.  Don't  ever  fool  yourself  and\nthink you're something more.\"<br><br>   \"Amir  agha  and  I  are  friends,\"\nHassan said. He looked flushed.<br><br>   \"Friends?\"  Assef  said,  laughing.\n\"You  pathetic  fool!  Someday  you'll\nwake  up  from  your  little  fantasy  and", "learn just how good of a friend he is.\nNow,  bas!  Enough  of  this.  Give  us\nthat kite.\"<br><br>   Hassan  stooped  and  picked  up  a\nrock.<br><br>   Assef  flinched.  He  began  to  take  a\nstep  back,  stopped.  \"Last  chance,\nHazara.\"<br><br>   Hassan's  answer  was  to  cock  the\narm that held the rock.<br><br>   \"Whatever  you  wish.\"  Assef\nunbuttoned his winter coat, took it off,\nfolded  it  slowly  and  deliberately.  He\nplaced it against the wall.<br><br>   I  opened  my  mouth,  almost  said\nsomething.  Almost.  The  rest  of  my\nlife might have turned out differently if\nI  had.  But  I  didn't.  I  just  watched.\nParalyzed.<br><br>   Assef  motioned  with  his  hand,  and\nthe  other  two  boys  separated,", "forming a half circle, trapping Hassan\nin the alley.<br><br> \"I've changed my mind,\" Assef said.\n\"I'm letting you keep the kite, Hazara.\nI'll  let  you  keep  it  so  it  will  always\nremind you of what I'm about to do.\"<br><br>     Then  he  charged.  Hassan  hurled\nthe  rock.  It  struck  Assef  in  the\nforehead.  Assef  yelped  as  he  flung\nhimself  at  Hassan,  knocking  him  to\nthe ground. Wali and Kamal followed.\n  I bit on my fist. Shut my eyes.<br><br>\nA  MEMORY:  Did  you  know  Hassan\nand  you  fed  from  the  same  breast?\nDid  you  know  that,  Amir  agha?\nSakina,  her  name  was.  She  was  a\nfair,  blue-eyed  Hazara  woman  from\nBamiyan  and  she  sang  you  old\nwedding  songs.  They  say  there  is  a\nbrotherhood  between  people  who've\nfed  from  the  same  breast.  Did  you", "know that? A memory: \"A rupia each,\nchildren.  Just  one  rupia  each  and  I\nwill  part  the  curtain  of  truth.\"  The  old\nman  sits  against  a  mud  wall.

Cups it before us. \"Not much\nto  ask  for  the  truth,  is  it,  a  rupia\neach?\"  Hassan  drops  a  coin  in  the\nleathery palm. I drop mine too. \"In the\nname  of  Allah  most  beneficent,  most\nmerciful,\"  the  old  fortune-teller\nwhispers.  He  takes  Hassan's  hand\nfirst,  strokes  the  palm  with  one\nhorn-like fingernail, round and round,\nround  and  round.  The  finger  then\nfloats  to  Hassan's  face  and  makes  a\ndry,  scratchy  sound  as  it  slowly\ntraces  the  curve  of  his  cheeks,  the\noutline  of  his  ears.

The  old\nman  takes  Hassan's  hand  and  puts\nthe  rupia  back  in  Hassan's  palm.  He\nturns  to  me.  \"How  about  you,  young\nfriend?\" he says. On the other side of\nthe  wall,  a  rooster  crows.  The  old\nman  reaches  for  my  hand  and  I\nwithdraw it.<br><br> A dream: I am lost in a snowstorm.\nThe  wind  shrieks,  blows  stinging\nsheets  of  snow  into  my  eyes.  I\nstagger  through  layers  of  shifting\nwhite.  I  call  for  help  but  the  wind\ndrowns my cries. I fall and lie panting\non  the  snow,  lost  in  the  white,  the\nwind  wailing  in  my  ears.  I  watch  the\nsnow erase my fresh footprints. I'm a\nghost  now,  I  think,  a  ghost  with  no\nfootprints.  I  cry  out  again,  hope\nfading  like  my  footprints.  But  this\ntime,  a  muffled  reply.  I  shield  my\neyes  and  manage  to  sit  up.  Out  of\nthe swaying curtains of snow, I catch\na  glimpse  of  movement,  a  flurry  of\ncolor.  A  familiar  shape  materializes.", "A  hand  reaches  out  for  me.  I  see\ndeep,  parallel  gashes  across  the\npalm,  blood  dripping,  staining  the\nsnow.  I  take  the  hand  and  suddenly\nthe snow is gone. We're standing in a\nfield of apple green \ngrass  with  soft  wisps  of  clouds\ndrifting  above.

Worn  bicycle  tires,\nbottles  with  peeled  labels,  ripped  up\nmagazines, yellowed newspapers, all\nscattered  amid  a  pile  of  bricks  and\nslabs  of  cement.  A  rusted  cast-iron\nstove  with  a  gaping  hole  on  its  side\ntilted  against  a  wall.  But  there  were\ntwo  things  amid  the  garbage  that  I\ncouldn't stop looking at: One was the\nblue  kite  resting  against  the  wall,\nclose to the cast-iron stove; the other\nwas  Hassan's  brown  corduroy  pants", "thrown on a heap of eroded bricks.<br><br> \"I don't know,\" Wali was saying. \"My\nfather  says  it's  sinful.\"  He  sounded\nunsure,  excited,  scared,  all  at  the\nsame time. Hassan lay with his chest\npinned  to  the  ground.  Kamal  and\nWali  each  gripped  an  arm,  twisted\nand  bent  at  the  elbow  so  that\nHassan's  hands  were  pressed  to  his\nback. Assef was standing over them,\nthe  heel  of  his  snow  boots  crushing\nthe back of Hassan's neck.<br><br>   \"Your  father  won't  find  out,\"  Assef\nsaid.  \"And  there's  nothing  sinful\nabout  teaching  a  lesson  to  a\ndisrespectful donkey.\"<br><br> \"I don't know,\" Wali muttered.<br><br>   \"Suit  yourself,\"  Assef  said.

They\nlooked relieved.<br><br>  Assef knelt behind Hassan, put his\nhands on Hassan's hips and lifted his\nbare  buttocks.  He  kept  one  hand  on\nHassan's  back  and  undid  his  own\nbelt  buckle  with  his  free  hand.  He\nunzipped  his  jeans.  Dropped  his\nunderwear.  He  positioned  himself\nbehind  Hassan.  Hassan  didn't\nstruggle.  Didn't  even  whimper.  He\nmoved his head slightly and I caught\na  glimpse  of  his  face.  Saw  the\nresignation  in  it.  It  was  a  look  I  had\nseen  before.  It  was  the  look  of  the\nlamb.<br><br>\nTOMORROW  IS  THE  TENTH  DAY\nof  Dhul-Hijjah,  the  last  month  of  the", "Muslim  calendar,  and  the  first  of\nthree  days  of  Eid  Al-Adha,  or\nEid-e-Qorban,  as  Afghans  call  it--a\nday  to  celebrate  how  the  prophet\nIbrahim almost sacrificed his own son\nfor  God.  Baba  has  handpicked  the\nsheep  again  this  year,  a  powder\nwhite one with crooked black ears.<br><br>   We  all  stand  in  the  backyard,\nHassan, Ali, Baba, and I. The mullah\nrecites  the  prayer,  rubs  his  beard.\nBaba  mutters,  Get  on  with  it,  under\nhis  breath.  He  sounds  annoyed  with\nthe  endless  praying,  the  ritual  of\nmaking  the  meat  halal.  Baba  mocks\nthe  story  behind  this  Eid,  like  he\nmocks  everything  religious.  But  he\nrespects  the  tradition  of\nEid-e-Qorban.  The  custom  is  to\ndivide  the  meat  in  thirds,  one  for  the\nfamily,  one  for  friends,  and  one  for\nthe poor.

The  sheep  kicks,  but\nnot  much.  The  mullah  grabs  it  under\nits  jaw  and  places  the  blade  on  its\nneck. Just a second before he slices\nthe throat in one expert motion, I see\nthe sheep's eyes. It is a look that will\nhaunt  my  dreams  for  weeks.  I  don't\nknow why I watch this yearly ritual in\nour  backyard;  my  nightmares  persist\nlong  after  the  bloodstains  on  the\ngrass  have  faded.  But  I  always\nwatch.  I  watch  because  of  that  look\nof  acceptance  in  the  animal's  eyes.\nAbsurdly,  I  imagine  the  animal\nunderstands.

Something", "warm  was  running  down  my  wrist.  I\nblinked, saw I was still biting down on\nmy fist, hard \nenough  to  draw  blood  from  the\nknuckles. I realized something else. I\nwas  weeping.  From  just  around  the\ncorner,  I  could  hear  Assef's  quick,\nrhythmic grunts.<br><br>   I  had  one  last  chance  to  make  a\ndecision.  One  final  opportunity  to\ndecide who I was going to be. I could\nstep  into  that  alley,  stand  up  for\nHassan--the  way  he'd  stood  up  for\nme  all  those  times  in  the  past--and\naccept  whatever  would  happen  to\nme. Or I could run.<br><br> In the end, I ran.<br><br> I ran because I was a coward. I was\nafraid of Assef and what he would do\nto me.<br><br>   I  was  afraid  of  getting  hurt.  That's\nwhat  I  told  myself  as  I  turned  my\nback  to  the  alley,  to  Hassan.  That's", "what I made myself believe. I actually\naspired  to  cowardice,  because  the\nalternative,  the  real  reason  I  was\nrunning,  was  that  Assef  was  right:\nNothing was free in this world. Maybe\nHassan  was  the  price  I  had  to  pay,\nthe  lamb  I  had  to  slay,  to  win  Baba.\nWas  it  a  fair  price?  The  answer\nfloated to my conscious mind before I\ncould thwart it: He was just a Hazara,\nwasn't  he?  I  ran  back  the  way  I'd\ncome.  Ran  back  to  the  all  but\ndeserted  bazaar.  I  lurched  to  a\ncubicle  and  leaned  against  the\npadlocked  swinging  doors.  I  stood\nthere  panting,  sweating,  wishing\nthings  had  turned  out  some  other\nway.<br><br>   About  fifteen  minutes  later,  I  heard\nvoices  and  running  footfalls.  I\ncrouched  behind  the  cubicle  and\nwatched  Assef  and  the  other  two\nsprinting by, laughing as they hurried\ndown  the  deserted  lane.  I  forced\nmyself  to  wait  ten  more  minutes.\nThen  I  walked  back  to  the  rutted", "track  that  ran  along  the  snow-filled\nravine.

And  I\ncan't  lie  now  and  say  my  eyes  didn't\nscan  it  for  any  rips.  His  chapan  had\nmud smudges down the front and his\nshirt was ripped just below the collar.\nHe  stopped.  Swayed  on  his  feet  like\nhe  was  going  to  collapse.  Then  he\nsteadied himself.<br><br> Handed me the kite. <br><br> \"Where were you? I looked for you,\"\nI said. Speaking those words was like\nchewing on a rock.<br><br>   Hassan  dragged  a  sleeve  across\nhis  face,  wiped  snot  and  tears.  I\nwaited  for  him  to  say  something,  but\nwe  just  stood  there  in  silence,  in  the\nfading  light.

Or,  God  forbid,  what  I\nfeared  most:  guileless  devotion?\nThat,  most  of  all,  I  couldn't  bear  to\nsee.<br><br> He began to say something and his\nvoice  cracked.  He  closed  his  mouth,\nopened it, and closed it again. Took a\nstep  back.  Wiped  his  face.  And  that\nwas  as  close  as  Hassan  and  I  ever\ncame  to  discussing  what  had\nhappened  in  the  alley.  I  thought  he\nmight  burst  into  tears,  but,  to  my\nrelief,  he  didn't,  and  I  pretended  I\nhadn't  heard  the  crack  in  his  voice.\nJust like I pretended I hadn't seen the\ndark stain in the seat of his pants.

Used\nto  sing  too,  over  the  hissing  of  the\niron,  sang  old  Hazara  songs  about\ntulip  fields.  Now  only  the  folded\nclothes  greeted  me.  That,  and  a\nbreakfast I hardly finished anymore.<br><br>   One  overcast  morning,  as  I  was\npushing the boiled egg around on my\nplate,  Ali  walked  in  cradling  a  pile  of\nchopped  wood.

Everyone in the van was\ntalking,  talking  loudly  and  at  the\nsame time, nearly shrieking, which is\nhow Afghans talk. I asked one of the\ntwins--Fazila or Karima, I could never\ntell  which  was  which--if  she'd  trade\nher  window  seat  with  me  so  I  could\nget  fresh  air  on  account  of  my  car\nsickness.  She  stuck  her  tongue  out\nand  said  no.  I  told  her  that  was  fine,\nbut I couldn't be held accountable for\nvomiting on her new dress. A minute\nlater, I was leaning out the window. I\nwatched  the  cratered  road  rise  and\nfall,  whirl  its  tail  around  the\nmountainside,  counted  the\nmulticolored  trucks  packed  with\nsquatting  men  lumbering  past.  I  tried\nclosing my eyes, letting the wind slap\nat  my  cheeks,  opened  my  mouth  to\nswallow the clean air. I still didn't feel\nbetter. A finger poked me in the side.\nIt was Fazila/Karima.<br><br> \"What?\" I said.  ", "    \"I  was  just  telling  everyone  about\nthe  tournament,\"  Baba  said  from\nbehind  the  wheel.  Kaka  Homayoun\nand  his  wives  were  smiling  at  me\nfrom the middle row of seats.<br><br>   \"There  must  have  been  a  hundred\nkites in the sky that day?\" Baba said.\n\"Is that about right, Amir?\"<br><br> \"I guess so,\" I mumbled.<br><br>   \"A  hundred  kites,  Homayoun  jan.\nNo  laaf.  And  the  only  one  still  flying\nat the end of the day was Amir's. He\nhas the last kite at home, a beautiful\nblue  kite.  Hassan  and  Amir  ran  it\ntogether.\"<br><br>   \"Congratulations,\"  Kaka  Homayoun\nsaid.  His  first  wife,  the  one  with  the\nwarts, clapped her hands. \"Wah wah,\nAmir  jan,  we're  all  so  proud  of  you!\"\nshe said. The younger wife joined in.\nThen  they  were  all  clapping,  yelping\ntheir praises, telling me how proud I'd\nmade  them  all.  Only  Rahim  Khan,", "sitting  in  the  passenger  seat  next  to\nBaba,  was  silent.  He  was  looking  at\nme in an odd way.<br><br> \"Please pull over, Baba,\" I said.<br><br> \"What?\"<br><br>   \"Getting  sick,\"  I  muttered,  leaning\nacross  the  seat,  pressing  against\nKaka Homayoun's daughters.<br><br>   Fazila/Karima's  face  twisted.  \"Pull\nover, Kaka! His face is yellow! I don't\nwant  him  throwing  up  on  my  new\ndress!\" she squealed.<br><br> Baba began to pull over, but I didn't\nmake  it.  A  few  minutes  later,  I  was\nsitting  on  a  rock  on  the  side  of  the\nroad as they aired out the van. Baba\nwas  smoking  with  Kaka  Homayoun\nwho was telling Fazila/Karima to stop\ncrying; he'd buy her another dress in\nJalalabad.  I  closed  my  eyes,  turned\nmy  face  to  the  sun.  Little  shapes\nformed behind my eyelids, like hands", "playing  shadows  on  the  wall.  They\ntwisted,  merged,  formed  a  single\nimage:  Hassan's  brown  corduroy\npants  discarded  on  a  pile  of  old\nbricks in the alley.<br><br>\n  KAKA  HOMAYOUN'S  WHITE,\ntwo-story  house  in  Jalalabad  had  a\nbalcony  overlooking  a  large,  walled\ngarden  with  apple  and  persimmon\ntrees. There were hedges that, in the\nsummer,  the  gardener  shaped  like\nanimals,  and  a  swimming  pool  with\nemerald  colored  tiles.  I  sat  on  the\nedge  of  the  pool,  empty  save  for  a\nlayer  of  slushy  snow  at  the  bottom,\nfeet  dangling  in.  Kaka  Homayoun's\nkids  were  playing  hide-and-seek  at\nthe  other  end  of  the  yard.  The\nwomen  were  cooking  and  I  could\nsmell  onions  frying  already,  could\nhear  the  phht-phht  of  a  pressure\ncooker,  music,  laughter.  Baba,\nRahim  Khan,  Kaka  Homayoun,  and\nKaka  Nader  were  sitting  on  the\nbalcony,  smoking.  Kaka  Homayoun", "was  telling  them  he'd  brought  the\nprojector  along  to  show  his  slides  of\nFrance.  Ten  years  since  he'd\nreturned  from  Paris  and  he  was  still\nshowing those stupid slides.<br><br> It shouldn't have felt this way. Baba\nand  I  were  finally  friends.  We'd  gone\nto  the  zoo  a  few  days  before,  seen\nMarjan  the  lion,  and  I  had  hurled  a\npebble at the bear when no one was\nwatching.  We'd  gone  to  Dadkhoda's\nKabob House afterward, across from\nCinema  Park,  had  lamb  kabob  with\nfreshly baked naan from the tandoor.\nBaba told me stories of his travels to\nIndia  and  Russia,  the  people  he  had\nmet,  like  the  armless,  legless  couple\nin  Bombay  who'd  been  married\nforty-seven  years  and  raised  eleven\nchildren.  That  should  have  been  fun,\nspending  a  day  like  that  with  Baba,\nhearing his stories. I finally had what\nI'd  wanted  all  those  years.  Except\nnow  that  I  had  it,  I  felt  as  empty  as\nthis unkempt pool I was dangling my\nlegs into. ", "    The  wives  and  daughters  served\ndinner--rice,  kofta,  and  chicken\nqurma--at  sundown.  We  dined  the\ntraditional  way,  sitting  on  cushions\naround  the  room,  tablecloth  spread\non the floor, eating with our hands in\ngroups  of  four  or  five  from  common\nplatters. I wasn't hungry but sat down\nto  eat  anyway  with  Baba,  Kaka\nFaruq,  and  Kaka  Homayoun's  two\nboys.  Baba,  who'd  had  a  few\nscotches  before  dinner,  was  still\nranting  about  the  kite  tournament,\nhow  I'd  outlasted  them  all,  how  I'd\ncome  home  with  the  last  kite.  His\nbooming  voice  dominated  the  room.\nPeople  raised  their  heads  from  their\nplatters,  called  out  their\ncongratulations.  Kaka  Faruq  patted\nmy  back  with  his  clean  hand.  I  felt\nlike sticking a knife in my eye.<br><br> Later, well past midnight, after a few\nhours of poker between Baba and his\ncousins,  the  men  lay  down  to  sleep\non  parallel  mattresses  in  the  same", "room  where  we'd  dined.  The  women\nwent  upstairs.  An  hour  later,  I  still\ncouldn't  sleep.  I  kept  tossing  and\nturning  as  my  relatives  grunted,\nsighed,  and  snored  in  their  sleep.  I\nsat  up.  A  wedge  of  moonlight\nstreamed in through the window.<br><br>     \"I  watched  Hassan  get  raped,\"  I\nsaid  to  no  one.  Baba  stirred  in  his\nsleep.  Kaka  Homayoun  grunted.  A\npart  of  me  was  hoping  someone\nwould  wake  up  and  hear,  so  I\nwouldn't  have  to  live  with  this  lie\nanymore. But no one woke up and in\nthe  silence  that  followed,  I\nunderstood  the  nature  of  my  new\ncurse: I was going to get away with it.\n  I thought about Hassan's dream, the\none  about  us  swimming  in  the  lake.\nThere  is  no  monster,  he'd  said,  just\nwater. Except he'd been wrong about\nthat.  There  was  a  monster  in  the\nlake.  It  had  grabbed  Hassan  by  the\nankles,  dragged  him  to  the  murky\nbottom. I was that monster. ", "    That  was  the  night  I  became  an\ninsomniac.<br><br>\nI  DIDN'T  SPEAK  TO  HASSAN  until\nthe  middle  of  the  next  week.  I  had\njust  half-eaten  my  lunch  and  Hassan\nwas  doing  the  dishes.  I  was  walking\nupstairs,  going  to  my  room,  when\nHassan  asked  if  I  wanted  to  hike  up\nthe  hill.  I  said  I  was  tired.  Hassan\nlooked tired too--he'd lost weight and\ngray  circles  had  formed  under  his\npuffed-up  eyes.  But  when  he  asked\nagain, I reluctantly agreed.<br><br>   We  trekked  up  the  hill,  our  boots\nsquishing in the muddy snow. Neither\none  of  us  said  anything.  We  sat\nunder  our  pomegranate  tree  and  I\nknew  I'd  made  a  mistake.  I  shouldn't\nhave  come  up  the  hill.  The  words  I'd\ncarved  on  the  tree  trunk  with  Ali's\nkitchen  knife,  Amir  and  Hassan:  The\nSultans  of  Kabul...  I  couldn't  stand", "looking at them now.<br><br>   He  asked  me  to  read  to  him  from\nthe  Shahnamah  and  I  told  him  I'd\nchanged  my  mind.  Told  him  I  just\nwanted  to  go  back  to  my  room.  He\nlooked  away  and  shrugged.  We\nwalked  back  down  the  way  we'd\ngone  up  in  silence.  And  for  the  first\ntime  in  my  life,  I  couldn't  wait  for\nspring.<br><br>\nMY MEMORY OF THE REST of that\nwinter  of  1975  is  pretty  hazy.  I\nremember  I  was  fairly  happy  when\nBaba  was  home.  We'd  eat  together,\ngo to see a film, visit \nKaka  Homayoun  or  Kaka  Faruq.\nSometimes  Rahim  Khan  came  over\nand  Baba  let  me  sit  in  his  study  and\nsip tea with them. He'd even have me\nread  him  some  of  my  stories.  It  was\ngood  and  I  even  believed  it  would\nlast. And Baba believed it too, I think.\nWe  both  should  have  known  better.", "For  at  least  a  few  months  after  the\nkite  tournament,  Baba  and  I\nimmersed  ourselves  in  a  sweet\nillusion, saw each other in a way that\nwe  never  had  before.  We'd  actually\ndeceived  ourselves  into  thinking  that\na toy made of tissue paper, glue, and\nbamboo  could  somehow  close  the\nchasm between us.<br><br>   But  when  Baba  was  out--and  he\nwas  out  a  lot--I  closed  myself  in  my\nroom.  I  read  a  book  every  couple  of\ndays,  wrote  stories,  learned  to  draw\nhorses.  I'd  hear  Hassan  shuffling\naround  the  kitchen  in  the  morning,\nhear  the  clinking  of  silverware,  the\nwhistle  of  the  teapot.  I'd  wait  to  hear\nthe  door  shut  and  only  then  I  would\nwalk  down  to  eat.  On  my  calendar,  I\ncircled  the  date  of  the  first  day  of\nschool and began a countdown.<br><br>   To  my  dismay,  Hassan  kept  trying\nto  rekindle  things  between  us.  I\nremember  the  last  time.  I  was  in  my\nroom,  reading  an  abbreviated  Farsi", "translation  of  Ivanhoe,  when  he\nknocked on my door.<br><br> \"What is it?\"<br><br> \"I'm going to the baker to buy naan,\"\nhe  said  from  the  other  side.  \"I  was\nwondering  if  you...  if  you  wanted  to\ncome along.\"<br><br>   \"I  think  I'm  just  going  to  read,\"  I\nsaid,  rubbing  my  temples.  Lately,\nevery time Hassan was around, I was\ngetting a headache.<br><br> \"It's a sunny day,\" he said.<br><br> \"I can see that.\"<br><br> \"Might be fun to go for a walk.\"<br><br> \"You go.\" <br><br> \"I wish you'd come along,\" he said.\nPaused. Something thumped against\nthe door, maybe his forehead. \"I don't\nknow  what  I've  done,  Amir  agha.  I\nwish  you'd  tell  me.  I  don't  know  why", "we don't play anymore.\"<br><br>   \"You  haven't  done  anything,\nHassan. Just go.\"<br><br> \"You can tell me, I'll stop doing it.\"<br><br>   I  buried  my  head  in  my  lap,\nsqueezed my temples with my knees,\nlike a vice.<br><br> \"I'll tell you what I want you to stop\ndoing,\" I said, eyes pressed shut.<br><br> \"Anything.\"<br><br> \"I want you to stop harassing me. I\nwant  you  to  go  away,\"  I  snapped.  I\nwished he would give it right back to\nme, break the door open and tell me\noff--it would have made things easier,\nbetter.  But  he  didn't  do  anything  like\nthat,  and  when  I  opened  the  door\nminutes  later,  he  wasn't  there.  I  fell\non my bed, buried my head under the\npillow, and cried. ", " \nHASSAN  MILLED  ABOUT  the\nperiphery of my life after that. I made\nsure  our  paths  crossed  as  little  as\npossible,  planned  my  day  that  way.\nBecause  when  he  was  around,  the\noxygen  seeped  out  of  the  room.  My\nchest  tightened  and  I  couldn't  draw\nenough  air;  I'd  stand  there,  gasping\nin  my  own  little  airless  bubble  of\natmosphere.  But  even  when  he\nwasn't around, he was. He was there\nin  the  hand-washed  and  ironed\nclothes on the cane-seat chair, in the\nwarm slippers left outside my door, in\nthe wood already burning in the stove\nwhen  I  came  down  for  breakfast.\nEverywhere  I  turned,  I  saw  signs  of\nhis  loyalty,  his  goddamn  unwavering\nloyalty.<br><br> Early that spring, a few days before\nthe  new  school  year  started,  Baba\nand  I  were  planting  tulips  in  the\ngarden. Most of the snow had melted\nand the hills in the north were already", "dotted with patches of green grass. It\nwas a cool, gray \nmorning,  and  Baba  was  squatting\nnext  to  me,  digging  the  soil  and\nplanting  the  bulbs  I  handed  to  him.\nHe  was  telling  me  how  most  people\nthought it was better to plant tulips in\nthe  fall  and  how  that  wasn't  true,\nwhen  I  came  right  out  and  said  it.\n\"Baba,  have  you  ever  thought  about\ngetting new servants?\"<br><br>   He  dropped  the  tulip  bulb  and\nburied  the  trowel  in  the  dirt.  Took  off\nhis gardening gloves. I'd startled him.\n\"Chi? What did you say?\"<br><br> \"I was just wondering, that's all.\"<br><br> \"Why would I ever want to do that?\"\nBaba said curtly.<br><br> \"You wouldn't, I guess. It was just a\nquestion,\" I said, my voice fading to a\nmurmur.  I  was  already  sorry  I'd  said\nit. ", "    \"Is  this  about  you  and  Hassan?  I\nknow  there's  something  going  on\nbetween  you  two,  but  whatever  it  is,\nyou  have  to  deal  with  it,  not  me.  I'm\nstaying out of it.\"<br><br> \"I'm sorry, Baba.\"<br><br> He put on his gloves again. \"I grew\nup with Ali,\" he said through clenched\nteeth.  \"My  father  took  him  in,  he\nloved  Ali  like  his  own  son.  Forty\nyears Ali's been with my family. Forty\ngoddamn  years.  And  you  think  I'm\njust  going  to  throw  him  out?\"  He\nturned to me now, his face as red as\na tulip. \"I've never laid a hand on you,\nAmir,  but  you  ever  say  that  again...\"\nHe  looked  away,  shaking  his  head.\n\"You bring me shame. And Hassan...\nHassan's not going anywhere, do you\nunderstand?\"<br><br>   I  looked  down  and  picked  up  a\nfistful of cool soil. Let it pour between\nmy fingers. ", "    \"I  said,  Do  you  understand?\"  Baba\nroared.<br><br> I flinched. \"Yes, Baba.\"<br><br>     \"Hassan's  not  going  anywhere,\"\nBaba  snapped.  He  dug  a  new  hole\nwith the trowel, striking the dirt harder\nthan  he  had  to.  \"He's  staying  right\nhere with us, where he belongs. This\nis  his  home  and  we're  his  family.\nDon't  you  ever  ask  me  that  question\nagain!\"<br><br> \"I won't, Baba. I'm sorry.\"<br><br>   We  planted  the  rest  of  the  tulips  in\nsilence.<br><br>   I  was  relieved  when  school  started\nthat  next  week.  Students  with  new\nnotebooks  and  sharpened  pencils  in\nhand  ambled  about  the  courtyard,\nkicking  up  dust,  chatting  in  groups,\nwaiting  for  the  class  captains'\nwhistles.  Baba  drove  down  the  dirt\nlane  that  led  to  the  entrance.  The\nschool  was  an  old  two-story  building", "with  broken  windows  and  dim,\ncobblestone  hallways,  patches  of  its\noriginal dull yellow paint still showing\nbetween sloughing chunks of plaster.\nMost  of  the  boys  walked  to  school,\nand  Baba's  black  Mustang  drew\nmore than one envious look. I should\nhave  been  beaming  with  pride  when\nhe dropped me off--the old me would\nhave--but  all  I  could  muster  was  a\nmild  form  of  embarrassment.  That\nand  emptiness.  Baba  drove  away\nwithout saying good-bye.<br><br>   I  bypassed  the  customary\ncomparing  of  kite-fighting  scars  and\nstood  in  line.  The  bell  rang  and  we\nmarched  to  our  assigned  class,  filed\nin  in  pairs.  I  sat  in  the  back  row.  As\nthe  Farsi  teacher  handed  out  our\ntextbooks,  I  prayed  for  a  heavy  load\nof homework.<br><br>   School  gave  me  an  excuse  to  stay\nin my room for long hours. And, for a\nwhile,  it  took  my  mind  off  what  had\nhappened  that  winter,  what  I  had  let", "happen.  For  a  few  weeks,  I\npreoccupied  myself  with  gravity  and\nmomentum,  atoms  and  cells,  the\nAnglo-Afghan  wars,  instead  of\nthinking  about  Hassan  and  what  had\nhappened  to  him.  But,  always,  my\nmind  returned  to  the  alley.  To\nHassan's brown corduroy pants lying\non  the  bricks.  To  the  droplets  of\nblood  staining  the  snow  dark  red,\nalmost black.<br><br>   One  sluggish,  hazy  afternoon  early\nthat  summer,  I  asked  Hassan  to  go\nup the hill with me. Told him I wanted\nto  read  him  a  new  story  I'd  written.\nHe was hanging clothes to dry in the\nyard  and  I  saw  his  eagerness  in  the\nharried way he finished the job. <br><br>   We  climbed  the  hill,  making  small\ntalk.  He  asked  about  school,  what  I\nwas  learning,  and  I  talked  about  my\nteachers,  especially  the  mean  math\nteacher  who  punished  talkative\nstudents  by  sticking  a  metal  rod\nbetween  their  fingers  and  then\nsqueezing  them  together.  Hassan", "winced  at  that,  said  he  hoped  I'd\nnever have to experience it. I said I'd\nbeen  lucky  so  far,  knowing  that  luck\nhad  nothing  to  do  with  it.  I  had  done\nmy  share  of  talking  in  class  too.  But\nmy  father  was  rich  and  everyone\nknew him, so I was spared the metal\nrod treatment.<br><br>   We  sat  against  the  low  cemetery\nwall  under  the  shade  thrown  by  the\npomegranate  tree.  In  another  month\nor  two,  crops  of  scorched  yellow\nweeds would blanket the hillside, but\nthat  year  the  spring  showers  had\nlasted  longer  than  usual,  nudging\ntheir way into early summer, and the\ngrass  was  still  green,  peppered  with\ntangles  of  wildflowers.  Below  us,\nWazir  Akbar  Khan's  white  walled,\nflat-topped  houses  gleamed  in  the\nsunshine,  the  laundry  hanging  on\nclotheslines  in  their  yards  stirred  by\nthe breeze to dance like butterflies.<br><br>   We  had  picked  a  dozen\npomegranates  from  the  tree.  I", "unfolded  the  story  I'd  brought  along,\nturned  to  the  first  page,  then  put  it\ndown.  I  stood  up  and  picked  up  an\noverripe pomegranate that had fallen\nto the ground.<br><br> \"What would you do if I hit you with\nthis?\"  I  said,  tossing  the  fruit  up  and\ndown.<br><br>   Hassan's  smile  wilted.  He  looked\nolder  than  I'd  remembered.  No,  not\nolder,  old.  Was  that  possible?  Lines\nhad  etched  into  his  tanned  face  and\ncreases framed his eyes, his mouth. I\nmight as well have taken a knife and\ncarved those lines myself.<br><br> \"What would you do?\" I repeated.<br><br> The color fell from his face. Next to\nhim, the stapled pages of the story I'd\npromised  to  read  him  fluttered  in  the\nbreeze.  I  hurled  the  pomegranate  at\nhim.  It  struck  him  in  the  chest,\nexploded  in  a  spray  of  red  pulp.\nHassan's  cry  was  pregnant  with", "surprise and pain.<br><br>   \"Hit  me  back!\"  I  snapped.  Hassan\nlooked from the stain on his chest to\nme. <br><br> \"Get up! Hit me!\" I said. Hassan did\nget  up,  but  he  just  stood  there,\nlooking  dazed  like  a  man  dragged\ninto the ocean by a riptide when, just\na  moment  ago,  he  was  enjoying  a\nnice stroll on the beach.<br><br> I hit him with another pomegranate,\nin  the  shoulder  this  time.  The  juice\nsplattered  his  face.  \"Hit  me  back!\"  I\nspat.  \"Hit  me  back,  goddamn  you!\"  I\nwished  he  would.  I  wished  he'd  give\nme  the  punishment  I  craved,  so\nmaybe  I'd  finally  sleep  at  night.\nMaybe  then  things  could  return  to\nhow they used to be between us. But\nHassan  did  nothing  as  I  pelted  him\nagain and again. \"You're a coward!\" I\nsaid.  \"Nothing  but  a  goddamn\ncoward!\"<br><br>   I  don't  know  how  many  times  I  hit", "him.  All  I  know  is  that,  when  I  finally\nstopped,  exhausted  and  panting,\nHassan was smeared in red like he'd\nbeen  shot  by  a  firing  squad.  I  fell  to\nmy knees, tired, spent, frustrated.<br><br>   Then  Hassan  did  pick  up  a\npomegranate. He walked toward me.\nHe  opened  it  and  crushed  it  against\nhis  own  forehead.  \"There,\"  he\ncroaked,  red  dripping  down  his  face\nlike blood. \"Are you satisfied? Do you\nfeel  better?\"  He  turned  around  and\nstarted down the hill.<br><br>   I  let  the  tears  break  free,  rocked\nback and forth on my knees.<br><br>   \"What  am  I  going  to  do  with  you,\nHassan? What am I going to do with\nyou?\" But by the time the tears dried\nup and I trudged down the hill, I knew\nthe answer to that question.<br><br>\nI  TURNED  THIRTEEN  that  summer", "of  1976,  Afghanistan's  next  to  last\nsummer  of  peace  and  anonymity.\nThings  between  Baba  and  me  were\nalready cooling off again. I think what\nstarted it was the stupid comment I'd\nmade  the  day  we  were  planting\ntulips,  about  getting  new  servants.  I\nregretted  saying  it--I  really  did--but  I\nthink  even  if  I  hadn't,  our  happy  little\ninterlude would have come to an end.\nMaybe not quite so soon, but it would\nhave. By the end of the summer, the\nscraping  of  spoon  and  fork  against\nthe  plate  had  replaced  dinner  table\nchatter  and  Baba  had  resumed\nretreating  to  his  study  after  supper.\nAnd  closing  the  door.  I'd  gone  back\nto  thumbing  through  Hafez  and\nKhayyam,  gnawing  my  nails  down  to\nthe cuticles, writing stories. I kept the\nstories  in  a  stack  under  my  bed,\nkeeping \nthem  just  in  case,  though  I  doubted\nBaba  would  ever  again  ask  me  to\nread them to him.<br><br> Baba's motto about throwing parties", "was this: Invite the whole world or it's\nnot  a  party.  I  remember  scanning\nover  the  invitation  list  a  week  before\nmy  birthday  party  and  not\nrecognizing at least three-quarters of\nthe  four  hundred--plus  Kakas  and\nKhalas  who  were  going  to  bring  me\ngifts  and  congratulate  me  for  having\nlived to thirteen. Then I realized they\nweren't  really  coming  for  me.  It  was\nmy birthday, but I knew who the real\nstar of the show was.<br><br>   For  days,  the  house  was  teeming\nwith  Baba's  hired  help.  There  was\nSalahuddin the butcher, who showed\nup  with  a  calf  and  two  sheep  in  tow,\nrefusing payment for any of the three.\nHe  slaughtered  the  animals  himself\nin the yard by a poplar tree. \"Blood is\ngood  for  the  tree,\"  I  remember  him\nsaying  as  the  grass  around  the\npoplar soaked red. Men I didn't know\nclimbed  the  oak  trees  with  coils  of\nsmall  electric  bulbs  and  meters  of\nextension  cords.  Others  set  up\ndozens  of  tables  in  the  yard,  spread", "a  tablecloth  on  each.  The  night\nbefore  the  big  party  Baba's  friend\nDel-Muhammad, who owned a kabob\nhouse  in  Shar-e-Nau,  came  to  the\nhouse  with  his  bags  of  spices.  Like\nthe  butcher,  Del-Muhammad--or\nDello,  as  Baba  called  him--refused\npayment  for  his  services.  He  said\nBaba had done enough for his family\nalready.  It  was  Rahim  Khan  who\nwhispered to me, as Dello marinated\nthe  meat,  that  Baba  had  lent  Dello\nthe  money  to  open  his  restaurant.\nBaba  had  refused  repayment  until\nDello  had  shown  up  one  day  in  our\ndriveway  in  a  Benz  and  insisted  he\nwouldn't  leave  until  Baba  took  his\nmoney.<br><br> I guess in most ways, or at least in\nthe ways in which parties are judged,\nmy  birthday  bash  was  a  huge\nsuccess. I'd never seen the house so\npacked.  Guests  with  drinks  in  hand\nwere  chatting  in  the  hallways,\nsmoking  on  the  stairs,  leaning\nagainst  doorways.  They  sat  where", "they  found  space,  on  kitchen\ncounters, in the foyer, even under the\nstairwell.  In  the  backyard,  they\nmingled  under  the  glow  of  blue,  red,\nand green lights winking in the trees,\ntheir  faces  illuminated  by  the  light  of\nkerosene  torches  propped\neverywhere.  Baba  had  had  a  stage\nbuilt  on  the  balcony  that  overlooked\nthe  garden  and  planted  speakers\nthroughout  the  yard.  Ahmad  Zahir\nwas playing an accordion and singing\non the stage over masses of dancing\nbodies.<br><br>   I  had  to  greet  each  of  the  guests\npersonally--Baba  made  sure  of  that;\nno  one  was  going  to  gossip  the  next\nday about how he'd raised a son with\nno  manners.  I  kissed  hundreds  of\ncheeks,  hugged  total  strangers,\nthanked  them  for  their  gifts.  My  face\nached from the strain of my plastered\nsmile. <br><br> I was standing with Baba in the yard\nnear  the  bar  when  someone  said,\n\"Happy birthday, Amir.\" It was Assef,", "with  his  parents.  Assef's  father,\nMahmood,  was  a  short,  lanky  sort\nwith dark skin and a narrow face. His\nmother, Tanya, was a small, nervous\nwoman who smiled and blinked a lot.\nAssef  was  standing  between  the  two\nof  them  now,  grinning,  looming  over\nboth,  his  arms  resting  on  their\nshoulders.  He  led  them  toward  us,\nlike  he  had  brought  them  here.  Like\nhe  was  the  parent,  and  they  his\nchildren.  A  wave  of  dizziness  rushed\nthrough  me.  Baba  thanked  them  for\ncoming.<br><br>   \"I  picked  out  your  present  myself,\"\nAssef  said.  Tanya's  face  twitched\nand  her  eyes  flicked  from  Assef  to\nme.  She  smiled,  unconvincingly,  and\nblinked.  I  wondered  if  Baba  had\nnoticed.<br><br>   \"Still  playing  soccer,  Assef  jan?\"\nBaba said. He'd always wanted me to\nbe friends with Assef.<br><br>   Assef  smiled.  It  was  creepy  how", "genuinely sweet he made it look. \"Of\ncourse, Kaka jan.\"<br><br> \"Right wing, as I recall?\"<br><br>   \"Actually,  I  switched  to  center\nforward  this  year,\"  Assef  said.  \"You\nget  to  score  more  that  way.  We're\nplaying  the  Mekro-Rayan  team  next\nweek. Should be a good match. They\nhave some good players.\"<br><br>   Baba  nodded.  \"You  know,  I  played\ncenter  forward  too  when  I  was\nyoung.\"<br><br> \"I'll bet you still could if you wanted\nto,\" Assef said. He favored Baba with\na good-natured wink.<br><br> Baba returned the wink. \"I see your\nfather  has  taught  you  his\nworld-famous  flattering  ways.\"  He\nelbowed  Assef's  father,  almost\nknocked  the  little  fellow  down.\nMahmood's  laughter  was  about  as\nconvincing  as  Tanya's  smile,  and", "suddenly  I  wondered  if  maybe,  on\nsome  level,  their  son  frightened\nthem.  I  tried  to  fake  a  smile,  but  all  I\ncould  manage  was  a  feeble\nup-turning  of  the  corners  of  my\nmouth--my  stomach  was  turning  at\nthe  sight  of  my  father  bonding  with\nAssef. <br><br>   Assef  shifted  his  eyes  to  me.  \"Wali\nand  Kamal  are  here  too.  They\nwouldn't  miss  your  birthday  for\nanything,\"  he  said,  laughter  lurking\njust  beneath  the  surface.  I  nodded\nsilently.<br><br> \"We're thinking about playing a little\ngame  of  volleyball  tomorrow  at  my\nhouse,\" Assef said. \"Maybe you'll join\nus. Bring Hassan if you want to.\"<br><br>   \"That  sounds  fun,\"  Baba  said,\nbeaming. \"What do you think, Amir?\"<br><br>   \"I  don't  really  like  volleyball,\"  I\nmuttered.  I  saw  the  light  wink  out  of\nBaba's  eyes  and  an  uncomfortable\nsilence followed. ", "    \"Sorry,  Assef  jan,\"  Baba  said,\nshrugging.  That  stung,  his\napologizing for me.<br><br>   \"Nay,  no  harm  done,\"  Assef  said.\n\"But  you  have  an  open  invitation,\nAmir jan.<br><br> Anyway, I heard you like to read so\nI  brought  you  a  book.  One  of  my\nfavorites.\"<br><br> He extended a wrapped birthday gift\nto me. \"Happy birthday.\"<br><br>   He  was  dressed  in  a  cotton  shirt\nand  blue  slacks,  a  red  silk  tie  and\nshiny  black  loafers.  He  smelled  of\ncologne  and  his  blond  hair  was\nneatly combed back. On the surface,\nhe  was  the  embodiment  of  every\nparent's  dream,  a  strong,  tall,\nwell-dressed  and  well-mannered  boy\nwith  talent  and  striking  looks,  not  to\nmention the wit to joke with an adult.\nBut  to  me,  his  eyes  betrayed  him.", "When  I  looked  into  them,  the  facade\nfaltered,  revealed  a  glimpse  of  the\nmadness hiding behind them.<br><br>   \"Aren't  you  going  to  take  it,  Amir?\"\nBaba was saying. \"Huh?\"<br><br>   \"Your  present,\"  he  said  testily.\n\"Assef jan is giving you a present.\"<br><br>     \"Oh,\"  I  said.  I  took  the  box  from\nAssef and lowered my gaze. I wished\nI could be alone in my room, with my\nbooks, away from these people.<br><br> \"Well?\" Baba said.<br><br> \"What?\"<br><br> Baba spoke in a low voice, the one\nhe  took  on  whenever  I  embarrassed\nhim  in  public.  \"Aren't  you  going  to\nthank  Assef  jan?  That  was  very\nconsiderate of him.\"<br><br>   I  wished  Baba  would  stop  calling\nhim  that.  How  often  did  he  call  me\n\"Amir  jan\"?  \"Thanks,\"  I  said.  Assef's", "mother looked at me like she wanted\nto say something, but she didn't, and\nI  realized  that  neither  of  Assef's\nparents  had  said  a  word.  Before  I\ncould  embarrass  myself  and  Baba\nanymore--but  mostly  to  get  away\nfrom  Assef  and  his  grin--I  stepped\naway. \"Thanks for coming,\" I said.<br><br>   I  squirmed  my  way  through  the\nthrong of guests and slipped through\nthe  wrought-iron  gates.  Two  houses\ndown  from  our  house,  there  was  a\nlarge,  barren  dirt  lot.  I'd  heard  Baba\ntell  Rahim  Khan  that  a  judge  had\nbought the land and that an architect\nwas working on the design. For now,\nthe lot was bare, save for dirt, stones,\nand weeds.<br><br>   I  tore  the  wrapping  paper  from\nAssef's  present  and  tilted  the  book\ncover  in  the  moonlight.  It  was  a\nbiography  of  Hitler.  I  threw  it  amid  a\ntangle of weeds.<br><br> I leaned against the neighbor's wall,", "slid  down  to  the  ground.  I  just  sat  in\nthe  dark  for  a  while,  knees  drawn  to\nmy  chest,  looking  up  at  the  stars,\nwaiting for the night to be over.<br><br>   \"Shouldn't  you  be  entertaining  your\nguests?\" a familiar voice said. Rahim\nKhan  was  walking  toward  me  along\nthe wall.<br><br>   \"They  don't  need  me  for  that.\nBaba's there, remember?\" I said. The\nice  in  Rahim  Khan's  drink  clinked\nwhen  he  sat  next  to  me.  \"I  didn't\nknow you drank.\"<br><br>  \"Turns out I do,\" he said. Elbowed\nme  playfully.  \"But  only  on  the  most\nimportant occasions.\"<br><br> I smiled. \"Thanks.\"<br><br> He tipped his drink to me and took a\nsip.  He  lit  a  cigarette,  one  of  the\nunfiltered Pakistani cigarettes he and\nBaba  were  always  smoking.  \"Did  I\never  tell  you  I  was  almost  married\nonce?\" ", "  \"Really?\" I said, smiling a little at the\nnotion  of  Rahim  Khan  getting\nmarried. I'd always thought of him as\nBaba's  quiet  alter  ego,  my  writing\nmentor,  my  pal,  the  one  who  never\nforgot  to  bring  me  a  souvenir,  a\nsaughat,  when  he  returned  from  a\ntrip  abroad.  But  a  husband?  A\nfather?  He  nodded.  \"It's  true.  I  was\neighteen.  Her  name  was  Homaira.\nShe  was  a  Hazara,  the  daughter  of\nour  neighbor's  servants.  She  was  as\nbeautiful  as  a  pari,  light  brown  hair,\nbig hazel eyes... she had this laugh...\nI  can  still  hear  it  sometimes.\"  He\ntwirled  his  glass.  \"We  used  to  meet\nsecretly  in  my  father's  apple\norchards, always after midnight when\neveryone  had  gone  to  sleep.  We'd\nwalk under the trees and I'd hold her\nhand... Am I embarrassing you, Amir\njan?\"<br><br> \"A little,\" I said.<br><br>   \"It  won't  kill  you,\"  he  said,  taking", "another  puff.  \"Anyway,  we  had  this\nfantasy.  We'd  have  a  great,  fancy\nwedding and invite family and friends\nfrom  Kabul  to  Kandahar.  I  would\nbuild  us  a  big  house,  white  with  a\ntiled  patio  and  large  windows.  We\nwould  plant  fruit  trees  in  the  garden\nand  grow  all  sorts  of  flowers,  have  a\nlawn  for  our  kids  to  play  on.  On\nFridays,  after  namaz  at  the  mosque,\neveryone  would  get  together  at  our\nhouse  for  lunch  and  we'd  eat  in  the\ngarden,  under  cherry  trees,  drink\nfresh  water  from  the  well.

I\nnever saw her again.\"<br><br> \"I'm sorry,\" I said.<br><br>   \"Probably  for  the  best,  though,\"\nRahim  Khan  said,  shrugging.  \"She\nwould have suffered. My family would\nhave  never  accepted  her  as  an\nequal.

He\nlooked  at  me  for  a  long  time,  like  he\nwas  waiting,  his  black  bottomless", "eyes  hinting  at  an  unspoken  secret\nbetween  us.  For  a  moment,  I  almost\ndid  tell  him.  Almost  told  him\neverything,  but  then  what  would  he\nthink  of  me?  He'd  hate  me,  and\nrightfully.<br><br> \"Here.\" He handed me something. \"I\nalmost forgot. Happy birthday.\" It was\na  brown  leather-bound  notebook.  I\ntraced  my  fingers  along  the\ngold-colored stitching on the borders.\nI  smelled  the  leather.  \"For  your\nstories,\" he said. I was going to thank\nhim  when  something  exploded  and\nbursts of fire lit up the sky.<br><br> \"Fireworks!\"<br><br>   We  hurried  back  to  the  house  and\nfound  the  guests  all  standing  in  the\nyard,  looking  up  to  the  sky.  Kids\nhooted  and  screamed  with  each\ncrackle  and  whoosh.  People\ncheered,  burst  into  applause  each\ntime  flares  sizzled  and  exploded  into\nbouquets  of  fire.  Every  few  seconds,", "the backyard lit up in sudden flashes\nof red, green, and yellow.<br><br> In one of those brief bursts of light, I\nsaw  something  I'll  never  forget:\nHassan  serving  drinks  to  Assef  and\nWali  from  a  silver  platter.  The  light\nwinked  out,  a  hiss  and  a  crackle,\nthen  another  flicker  of  orange  light:\nAssef  grinning,  kneading  Hassan  in\nthe chest with a knuckle. <br><br> Then, mercifully, darkness.", "#$#$Chapter 9#$#$<br><br>Sitting  in  the  middle  of  my  room  the\nnext morning, I ripped open box after\nbox  of  presents.  I  don't  know  why  I\neven bothered, since I just gave them\na joyless glance and pitched them to\nthe corner of the room. The pile was\ngrowing  there:  a  Polaroid  camera,  a\ntransistor  radio,  an  elaborate  electric\ntrain  set--and  several  sealed\nenvelopes containing cash. I knew I'd\nnever  spend  the  money  or  listen  to\nthe radio, and the electric train would\nnever  trundle  down  its  tracks  in  my\nroom. I didn't want any of it--it was all\nblood  money;  Baba  would  have\nnever  thrown  me  a  party  like  that  if  I\nhadn't won the tournament.<br><br>   Baba  gave  me  two  presents.  One\nwas  sure  to  become  the  envy  of\nevery  kid  in  the  neighborhood:  a\nbrand  new  Schwinn  Stingray,  the\nking of all bicycles. Only a handful of", "kids  in  all  of  Kabul  owned  a  new\nStingray and now I was one of them.\nIt had high-rise handlebars with black\nrubber  grips  and  its  famous  banana\nseat.<br><br>   The  spokes  were  gold  colored  and\nthe  steel-frame  body  red,  like  a\ncandy apple. Or blood. Any other kid\nwould  have  hopped  on  the  bike\nimmediately  and  taken  it  for  a  full\nblock  skid.  I  might  have  done  the\nsame a few months ago.<br><br>   \"You  like  it?\"  Baba  said,  leaning  in\nthe  doorway  to  my  room.  I  gave  him\na  sheepish  grin  and  a  quick  \"Thank\nyou.\" I wished I could have mustered\nmore.<br><br> \"We could go for a ride,\" Baba said.\nAn  invitation,  but  only  a  halfhearted\none. <br><br>   \"Maybe  later.  I'm  a  little  tired,\"  I\nsaid.<br><br> \"Sure,\" Baba said. ", "  \"Baba?\"<br><br> \"Yes?\"<br><br> \"Thanks for the fireworks,\" I said. A\nthank-you,  but  only  a  halfhearted\none.<br><br> \"Get some rest,\" Baba said, walking\ntoward his room.<br><br>   The  other  present  Baba  gave\nme--and he didn't wait around for me\nto open this one--was a wristwatch. It\nhad  a  blue  face  with  gold  hands  in\nthe  shape  of  lightning  bolts.  I  didn't\neven try it on. I tossed it on the pile of\ntoys  in  the  corner.  The  only  gift  I\ndidn't toss on that mound was Rahim\nKhan's leather-bound notebook. That\nwas  the  only  one  that  didn't  feel  like\nblood money.<br><br> I sat on the edge of my bed, turned\nthe  notebook  in  my  hands,  thought\nabout  what  Rahim  Khan  had  said", "about  Homaira,  how  his  father's\ndismissing her had been for the best\nin the end. She would have suffered.\nLike  the  times  Kaka  Homayoun's\nprojector got stuck on the same slide,\nthe  same  image  kept  flashing  in  my\nmind  over  and  over:  Hassan,  his\nhead  downcast,  serving  drinks  to\nAssef  and  Wali.  Maybe  it  would  be\nfor  the  best.  Lessen  his  suffering.\nAnd  mine  too.  Either  way,  this  much\nhad  become  clear:  One  of  us  had  to\ngo.<br><br>   Later  that  afternoon,  I  took  the\nSchwinn  for  its  first  and  last  spin.  I\npedaled around the block a couple of\ntimes and came back. I rolled up the\ndriveway  to  the  backyard  where\nHassan and Ali were cleaning up the\nmess  from  last  night's  party.  Paper\ncups,  crumpled  napkins,  and  empty\nbottles  of  soda  littered  the  yard.  Ali\nwas  folding  chairs,  setting  them\nalong  the  wall.  He  saw  me  and\nwaved. ", "  \"Salaam, Ali,\" I said, waving back. <br><br>   He  held  up  a  finger,  asking  me  to\nwait,  and  walked  to  his  living\nquarters.  A  moment  later,  he\nemerged  with  something  in  his\nhands.  \"The  opportunity  never\npresented  itself  last  night  for  Hassan\nand  me  to  give  you  this,\"  he  said,\nhanding  me  a  box.  \"It's  modest  and\nnot worthy of you, Amir agha. But we\nhope you like it still. Happy birthday.\"<br><br>   A  lump  was  rising  in  my  throat.\n\"Thank you, Ali,\" I said. I wished they\nhadn't bought me anything. I opened\nthe  box  and  found  a  brand  new\nShahnamah,  a  hardback  with  glossy\ncolored  illustrations  beneath  the\npassages. Here was Ferangis gazing\nat  her  newborn  son,  Kai  Khosrau.\nThere was Afrasiyab riding his horse,\nsword  drawn,  leading  his  army.  And,\nof  course,  Rostam  inflicting  a  mortal\nwound  onto  his  son,  the  warrior\nSohrab. \"It's beautiful,\" I said.<br><br> \"Hassan said your copy was old and", "ragged,  and  that  some  of  the  pages\nwere  missing,\"  Ali  said.  \"All  the\npictures  are  hand-drawn  in  this  one\nwith pen and ink,\" he added proudly,\neyeing a book neither he nor his son\ncould read.<br><br> \"It's lovely,\" I said. And it was. And, I\nsuspected,  not  inexpensive  either.  I\nwanted to tell Ali it was not the book,\nbut  I  who  was  unworthy.  I  hopped\nback  on  the  bicycle.  \"Thank  Hassan\nfor me,\" I said.<br><br> I ended up tossing the book on the\nheap  of  gifts  in  the  corner  of  my\nroom.  But  my  eyes  kept  going  back\nto  it,  so  I  buried  it  at  the  bottom.\nBefore  I  went  to  bed  that  night,  I\nasked  Baba  if  he'd  seen  my  new\nwatch anywhere.<br><br>\nTHE  NEXT  MORNING,  I  waited  in\nmy room for Ali to clear the breakfast\ntable in the kitchen. Waited for him to", "do  the  dishes,  wipe  the  counters.  I\nlooked  out  my  bedroom  window  and\nwaited  until  Ali  and  Hassan  went\ngrocery  shopping  to  the  bazaar,\npushing  the  empty  wheelbarrows  in\nfront of them.<br><br>   Then  I  took  a  couple  of  the\nenvelopes  of  cash  from  the  pile  of\ngifts and my watch, and tiptoed out. I\npaused  before  Baba's  study  and\nlistened  in.  He'd  been  in  there  all\nmorning, making phone calls. He was\ntalking  to  someone  now,  about  a\nshipment  of  rugs  due  to  arrive  next\nweek. I went downstairs, crossed the\nyard,  and  entered  Ali  and  Hassan's\nliving  quarters  by  the  loquat  tree.  I\nlifted  Hassan's  mattress  and  planted\nmy  new  watch  and  a  handful  of\nAfghani bills under it.<br><br>     I  waited  another  thirty  minutes.\nThen  I  knocked  on  Baba's  door  and\ntold what I hoped would be the last in\na long line of shameful lies.<br><br>", "THROUGH  MY  BEDROOM\nWINDOW, I watched Ali and Hassan\npush  the  wheelbarrows  loaded  with\nmeat,  naan,  fruit,  and  vegetables  up\nthe  driveway.  I  saw  Baba  emerge\nfrom  the  house  and  walk  up  to  Ali.\nTheir  mouths  moved  over  words  I\ncouldn't  hear.  Baba  pointed  to  the\nhouse  and  Ali  nodded.  They\nseparated.  Baba  came  back  to  the\nhouse;  Ali  followed  Hassan  to  their\nhut.<br><br> A few moments later, Baba knocked\non  my  door.  \"Come  to  my  office,\"  he\nsaid.<br><br>   \"We're  all  going  to  sit  down  and\nsettle this thing.\"<br><br> I went to Baba's study, sat in one of\nthe  leather  sofas.  It  was  thirty\nminutes  or  more  before  Hassan  and\nAli joined us.<br><br>", "THEY'D  BOTH  BEEN  CRYING;  I\ncould  tell  from  their  red,  puffed  up\neyes.  They  stood  before  Baba,  hand\nin  hand,  and  I  wondered  how  and\nwhen  I'd  become  capable  of  causing\nthis kind of pain.<br><br>   Baba  came  right  out  and  asked.\n\"Did  you  steal  that  money?  Did  you\nsteal Amir's watch, Hassan?\"<br><br>   Hassan's  reply  was  a  single  word,\ndelivered  in  a  thin,  raspy  voice:\n\"Yes.\"<br><br> I flinched, like I'd been slapped. My\nheart  sank  and  I  almost  blurted  out\nthe  truth.  Then  I  understood:  This\nwas Hassan's final sacrifice for me. If\nhe'd  said  no,  Baba  would  have\nbelieved  him  because  we  all  knew\nHassan never lied. And if \nBaba  believed  him,  then  I'd  be  the\naccused; I would have to explain and\nI  would  be  revealed  for  what  I  really\nwas.  Baba  would  never,  ever  forgive", "me.  And  that  led  to  another\nunderstanding:  Hassan  knew  He\nknew I'd seen everything in that alley,\nthat I'd stood there and done nothing.\nHe knew I had betrayed him and yet\nhe  was  rescuing  me  once  again,\nmaybe for the last time. I loved him in\nthat moment, loved him more than I'd\never  loved  anyone,  and  I  wanted  to\ntell  them  all  that  I  was  the  snake  in\nthe  grass,  the  monster  in  the  lake.  I\nwasn't worthy of this sacrifice; I was a\nliar, a cheat, and a thief. And I would\nhave  told,  except  that  a  part  of  me\nwas  glad.  Glad  that  this  would  all  be\nover  with  soon.  Baba  would  dismiss\nthem, there would be some pain, but\nlife  would  move  on.  I  wanted  that,  to\nmove  on,  to  forget,  to  start  with  a\nclean  slate.  I  wanted  to  be  able  to\nbreathe again.<br><br> Except Baba stunned me by saying,\n\"I forgive you.\"<br><br>   Forgive?  But  theft  was  the  one\nunforgivable  sin,  the  common", "denominator of all sins. When you kill\na man, you steal a life. You steal his\nwife's  right  to  a  husband,  rob  his\nchildren  of  a  father.  When  you  tell  a\nlie,  you  steal  someone's  right  to  the\ntruth.  When  you  cheat,  you  steal  the\nright to fairness. There is no act more\nwretched  than  stealing.  Hadn't  Baba\nsat  me  on  his  lap  and  said  those\nwords to me? Then how could he just\nforgive  Hassan?  And  if  Baba  could\nforgive  that,  then  why  couldn't  he\nforgive me for not being the son he'd\nalways  wanted?  Why--\"We  are\nleaving, Agha sahib,\" Ali said.<br><br>   \"What?\"  Baba  said,  the  color\ndraining from his face.<br><br>   \"We  can't  live  here  anymore,\"  Ali\nsaid.<br><br>   \"But  I  forgive  him,  Ali,  didn't  you\nhear?\" said Baba.<br><br> \"Life here is impossible for us now,\nAgha  sahib.  We're  leaving.\"  Ali  drew", "Hassan to him, curled his arm around\nhis son's shoulder. It was a protective\ngesture  and  I  knew  whom  Ali  was\nprotecting  him  from.  Ali  glanced  my\nway and in his cold, unforgiving look,\nI  saw  that  Hassan  had  told  him.  He\nhad  told  him  everything,  about  what\nAssef  and  his  friends  had  done  to\nhim,  about  the  kite,  about  me.\nStrangely,  I  was  glad  that  someone\nknew  me  for  who  I  really  was;  I  was\ntired of pretending. <br><br> \"I don't care about the money or the\nwatch,\"  Baba  said,  his  arms  open,\npalms up.<br><br> \"I don't understand why you're doing\nthis...  what  do  you  mean\n'impossible'?\"<br><br> \"I'm sorry, Agha sahib, but our bags\nare  already  packed.  We  have  made\nour decision.\"<br><br>   Baba  stood  up,  a  sheen  of  grief\nacross  his  face.  \"Ali,  haven't  I\nprovided well for you? Haven't I been", "good to you and Hassan? You're the\nbrother  I  never  had,  Ali,  you  know\nthat. Please don't do this.\"<br><br> \"Don't make this even more difficult\nthan  it  already  is,  Agha  sahib,\"  Ali\nsaid.  His  mouth  twitched  and,  for  a\nmoment,  I  thought  I  saw  a  grimace.\nThat  was  when  I  understood  the\ndepth  of  the  pain  I  had  caused,  the\nblackness  of  the  grief  I  had  brought\nonto  everyone,  that  not  even  Ali's\nparalyzed  face  could  mask  his\nsorrow.  I  forced  myself  to  look  at\nHassan, but his head was downcast,\nhis  shoulders  slumped,  his  finger\ntwirling  a  loose  string  on  the  hem  of\nhis shirt.<br><br>   Baba  was  pleading  now.  \"At  least\ntell me why. I need to know!\"<br><br> Ali didn't tell Baba, just as he didn't\nprotest  when  Hassan  confessed  to\nthe  stealing.  I'll  never  really  know\nwhy,  but  I  could  imagine  the  two  of\nthem  in  that  dim  little  hut,  weeping,", "Hassan  pleading  him  not  to  give  me\naway.  But  I  couldn't  imagine  the\nrestraint  it  must  have  taken  Ali  to\nkeep that promise.<br><br>   \"Will  you  drive  us  to  the  bus\nstation?\"<br><br>   \"I  forbid  you  to  do  this!\"  Baba\nbellowed.  \"Do  you  hear  me?  I  forbid\nyou!\"<br><br>   \"Respectfully,  you  can't  forbid  me\nanything,  Agha  sahib,\"  Ali  said.  \"We\ndon't work for you anymore.\"<br><br>   \"Where  will  you  go?\"  Baba  asked.\nHis voice was breaking.<br><br>  \"Hazarajat.\"<br><br> \"To your cousin?\"<br><br>   \"Yes.  Will  you  take  us  to  the  bus\nstation, Agha sahib?\"<br><br>   Then  I  saw  Baba  do  something  I\nhad  never  seen  him  do  before:  He", "cried.  It  scared  me  a  little,  seeing  a\ngrown  man  sob.  Fathers  weren't\nsupposed to cry. \"Please,\" Baba was\nsaying,  but  Ali  had  already  turned  to\nthe  door,  Hassan  trailing  him.  I'll\nnever  forget  the  way  Baba  said  that,\nthe pain in his plea, the fear.<br><br>\nIN  KABUL,  it  rarely  rained  in  the\nsummer.  Blue  skies  stood  tall  and\nfar,  the  sun  like  a  branding  iron\nsearing  the  back  of  your  neck.\nCreeks  where  Hassan  and  I  skipped\nstones  all  spring  turned  dry,  and\nrickshaws  stirred  dust  when  they\nsputtered  by.  People  went  to\nmosques  for  their  ten  raka'ts  of\nnoontime  prayer  and  then  retreated\nto  whatever  shade  they  could  find  to\nnap  in,  waiting  for  the  cool  of  early\nevening.  Summer  meant  long  school\ndays  sweating  in  tightly  packed,\npoorly ventilated classrooms learning\nto  recite  ayats  from  the  Koran,\nstruggling with those tongue-twisting,", "exotic  Arabic  words.  It  meant\ncatching  flies  in  your  palm  while  the\nmullah  droned  on  and  a  hot  breeze\nbrought  with  it  the  smell  of  shit  from\nthe  outhouse  across  the  schoolyard,\nchurning dust around the lone rickety\nbasketball hoop.<br><br>   But  it  rained  the  afternoon  Baba\ntook  Ali  and  Hassan  to  the  bus\nstation.  Thunderheads  rolled  in,\npainted  the  sky  iron  gray.  Within\nminutes,  sheets  of  rain  were\nsweeping in, the steady hiss of falling\nwater swelling in my ears.<br><br>   Baba  had  offered  to  drive  them  to\nBamiyan  himself,  but  Ali  refused.\nThrough  the  blurry,  rain-soaked\nwindow of my bedroom, I watched Ali\nhaul  the  lone  suitcase  carrying  all  of\ntheir  belongings  to  Baba's  car  idling\noutside the gates. Hassan lugged his\nmattress, rolled tightly and tied with a\nrope,  on  his  back.  He'd  left  all  of  his\ntoys  behind  in  the  empty  shack--I\ndiscovered  them  the  next  day,  piled", "in  a  corner  just  like  the  birthday\npresents in my room. <br><br>   Slithering  beads  of  rain  sluiced\ndown  my  window.  I  saw  Baba  slam\nthe  trunk  shut.  Already  drenched,  he\nwalked to the driver's side. Leaned in\nand  said  something  to  Ali  in  the\nbackseat,  perhaps  one  last-ditch\neffort  to  change  his  mind.  They\ntalked  that  way  awhile,  Baba  getting\nsoaked,  stooping,  one  arm  on  the\nroof  of  the  car.  But  when  he\nstraightened,  I  saw  in  his  slumping\nshoulders  that  the  life  I  had  known\nsince  I'd  been  born  was  over.  Baba\nslid  in.  The  headlights  came  on  and\ncut  twin  funnels  of  light  in  the  rain.  If\nthis  were  one  of  the  Hindi  movies\nHassan and I used to watch, this was\nthe  part  where  I'd  run  outside,  my\nbare  feet  splashing  rainwater.  I'd\nchase  the  car,  screaming  for  it  to\nstop.  I'd  pull  Hassan  out  of  the\nbackseat and tell him I was sorry, so\nsorry, my tears mixing with rainwater.\nWe'd  hug  in  the  downpour.  But  this\nwas no Hindi movie. I was sorry, but I", "didn't cry and I didn't chase the car. I\nwatched  Baba's  car  pull  away  from\nthe  curb,  taking  with  it  the  person\nwhose  first  spoken  word  had  been\nmy  name.  I  caught  one  final  blurry\nglimpse  of  Hassan  slumped  in  the\nback  seat  before  Baba  turned  left  at\nthe  street  corner  where  we'd  played\nmarbles so many times.<br><br>   I  stepped  back  and  all  I  saw  was\nrain  through  windowpanes  that\nlooked like melting silver.", "#$#$Chapter 10#$#$<br><br>March 1981 \nA  young  woman  sat  across  from  us.\nShe  was  dressed  in  an  olive  green\ndress  with  a  black  shawl  wrapped\ntightly  around  her  face  against  the\nnight  chill.  She  burst  into  prayer\nevery  time  the  truck  jerked  or\nstumbled  into  a  pothole,  her\n\"Bismillah!\"  peaking  with  each  of  the\ntruck's  shudders  and  jolts.  Her\nhusband, a burly man in baggy pants\nand  sky  blue  turban,  cradled  an\ninfant  in  one  arm  and  thumbed\nprayer  beads  with  his  free  hand.  His\nlips  moved  in  silent  prayer.  There\nwere  others,  in  all  about  a  dozen,\nincluding  Baba  and  me,  sitting  with\nour  suitcases  between  our  legs,\ncramped  with  these  strangers  in  the\ntarpaulin-covered  cab  of  an  old\nRussian truck.<br><br>     My  innards  had  been  roiling  since", "we'd  left  Kabul  just  after  two  in  the\nmorning.  Baba  never  said  so,  but  I\nknew he saw my car sickness as yet\nanother  of  my  array  of  weakness--I\nsaw  it  on  his  embarrassed  face  the\ncouple  of  times  my  stomach  had\nclenched  so  badly  I  had  moaned.\nWhen  the  burly  guy  with  the\nbeads--the  praying  woman's\nhusband--asked  if  I  was  going  to  get\nsick,  I  said  I  might.  Baba  looked\naway.  The  man  lifted  his  corner  of\nthe tarpaulin cover and rapped on the\ndriver's  window,  asked  him  to  stop.\nBut  the  driver,  Karim,  a  scrawny\ndark-skinned  man  with  hawk-boned\nfeatures  and  a  pencil-thin  mustache,\nshook his head.<br><br> \"We are too close to Kabul,\" he shot\nback.  \"Tell  him  to  have  a  strong\nstomach.\"<br><br> Baba grumbled something under his\nbreath.  I  wanted  to  tell  him  I  was\nsorry,  but  suddenly  I  was  salivating,\nthe  back  of  my  throat  tasting  bile.  I", "turned  around,  lifted  the  tarpaulin,\nand  threw  up  over  the  side  of  the\nmoving  truck.  Behind  me,  Baba  was\napologizing  to  the  other  passengers.\nAs  if  car  sickness  was  a  crime.  As  if\nyou  weren't  supposed  to  get  sick\nwhen  you  were  eighteen.  I  threw  up\ntwo  more  times  before  Karim  agreed\nto  stop,  mostly  so  I  wouldn't  stink  up\nhis  vehicle,  the  instrument  of  his\nlivelihood.  Karim  was  a  people\nsmuggler--it  was  a  pretty  lucrative\nbusiness  then,  driving  people  out  of\nShorawi-occupied  Kabul  to  the\nrelative  safety  of  Pakistan.  He  was\ntaking  us  to  Jalalabad,  about  170\nkilometers southeast of Kabul, where\nhis  brother,  Toor,  who  had  a  bigger\ntruck  with  a  second  convoy  of\nrefugees,  was  waiting  to  drive  us\nacross  the  Khyber  Pass  and  into\nPeshawar.<br><br>   We  were  a  few  kilometers  west  of\nMahipar  Falls  when  Karim  pulled  to\nthe  side  of  the  road.  Mahipar--which\nmeans  \"Flying  Fish\"--was  a  high", "summit  with  a  precipitous  drop\noverlooking  the  hydro  plant  the\nGermans  had  built  for  Afghanistan\nback in 1967. Baba and I had driven\nover  the  summit  countless  times  on\nour  way  to  Jalalabad,  the  city  of\ncypress  trees  and  sugarcane  fields\nwhere  Afghans  vacationed  in  the\nwinter.<br><br> I hopped down the back of the truck\nand  lurched  to  the  dusty\nembankment on the side of the road.\nMy  mouth  filled  with  saliva,  a  sign  of\nthe  retching  that  was  yet  to  come.  I\nstumbled  to  the  edge  of  the  cliff\noverlooking  the  deep  valley  that  was\nshrouded  in  dark  ness.  I  stooped,\nhands  on  my  kneecaps,  and  waited\nfor  the  bile.  Somewhere,  a  branch\nsnapped,  an  owl  hooted.  The  wind,\nsoft  and  cold,  clicked  through  tree\nbranches and stirred the bushes that\nsprinkled  the  slope.  And  from  below,\nthe  faint  sound  of  water  tumbling\nthrough the valley.<br><br>     Standing  on  the  shoulder  of  the", "road,  I  thought  of  the  way  we'd  left\nthe  house  where  I'd  lived  my  entire\nlife, as if we were going out for a bite:\ndishes  smeared  with  kofta  piled  in\nthe kitchen sink; laundry in the wicker\nbasket  in  the  foyer;  beds  unmade;\nBaba's  business  suits  hanging  in  the\ncloset.  Tapestries  still  hung  on  the\nwalls  of  the  living  room  and  my\nmother's  books  still  crowded  the\nshelves in Baba's study. The signs of\nour  elopement  were  subtle:  My\nparents'  wedding  picture  was  gone,\nas  was  the  grainy  photograph  of  my\ngrandfather  and  King  Nader  Shah\nstanding  over  the  dead  deer.  A  few\nitems  of  clothing  were  missing  from\nthe  closets.  The  leather-bound\nnotebook  Rahim  Khan  had  given  me\nfive years earlier was gone.<br><br>   In  the  morning,  Jalaluddin--our\nseventh  servant  in  five  years--would\nprobably  think  we'd  gone  out  for  a\nstroll  or  a  drive.  We  hadn't  told  him.\nYou  couldn't  trust  anyone  in  Kabul\nany  more--for  a  fee  or  under  threat,", "people  told  on  each  other,  neighbor\non  neighbor,  child  on  parent,  brother\non  brother,  servant  on  master,  friend\non  friend.  I  thought  of  the  singer\nAhmad  Zahir,  who  had  played  the\naccordion  at  my  thirteenth  birthday.\nHe  had  gone  for  a  drive  with  some\nfriends, and someone had later found\nhis  body  on  the  side  of  the  road,  a\nbullet  in  the  back  of  his  head.  The\nrafiqs,  the  comrades,  were\neverywhere  and  they'd  split  Kabul\ninto  two  groups:  those  who\neavesdropped  and  those  who  didn't.\nThe tricky part was that no one knew\nwho  belonged  to  which.  A  casual\nremark to the tailor while getting fitted\nfor  a  suit  might  land  you  in  the\ndungeons  of  Poleh-charkhi.\nComplain  about  the  curfew  to  the\nbutcher and next thing you knew, you\nwere  behind  bars  staring  at  the\nmuzzle  end  of  a  Kalashnikov.  Even\nat  the  dinner  table,  in  the  privacy  of\ntheir home, people had to speak in a\ncalculated manner--the rafiqs were in\nthe  classrooms  too;  they'd  taught", "children to spy on their parents, what\nto listen for, whom to tell.<br><br> What was I doing on this road in the\nmiddle  of  the  night?  I  should  have\nbeen  in  bed,  under  my  blanket,  a\nbook  with  dog-eared  pages  at  my\nside. This had to be a dream. Had to\nbe.  Tomorrow  morning,  I'd  wake  up,\npeek  out  the  window:  No  grim-faced\nRussian  soldiers  patrolling  the\nsidewalks,  no  tanks  rolling  up  and\ndown  the  streets  of  my  city,  their\nturrets  swiveling  like  accusing\nfingers,  no  rubble,  no  curfews,  no\nRussian  Army  Personnel  Carriers\nweaving  through  the  bazaars.  Then,\nbehind  me,  I  heard  Baba  and  Karim\ndiscussing  the  arrangement  in\nJalalabad  over  a  smoke.  Karim  was\nreassuring  Baba  that  his  brother  had\na  big  truck  of  \"excellent  and\nfirst-class quality,\" and that the trek to\nPeshawar would be very routine. \"He\ncould  take  you  there  with  his  eyes\nclosed,\"  Karim  said.  I  overheard  him\ntelling  Baba  how  he  and  his  brother", "knew  the  Russian  and  Afghan\nsoldiers who worked the checkpoints,\nhow  they  had  set  up  a  \"mutually\nprofitable\" arrangement. This was no\ndream. As if on cue, a MiG suddenly\nscreamed  past  overhead.  Karim\ntossed  his  cigarette  and  produced  a\nhand gun from his waist. Pointing it to\nthe  sky  and  making  shooting\ngestures,  he  spat  and  cursed  at  the\nMiG.<br><br>     I  wondered  where  Hassan  was.\nThen  the  inevitable.  I  vomited  on  a\ntangle  of  weeds,  my  retching  and\ngroaning  drowned  in  the  deafening\nroar of the MiG.<br><br>\nWE PULLED UP to the checkpoint at\nMahipar  twenty  minutes  later.  Our\ndriver  let  the  truck  idle  and  hopped\ndown  to  greet  the  approaching\nvoices.  Feet  crushed  gravel.  Words\nwere exchanged, brief and hushed. A\nflick of a lighter. \"Spasseba.\" ", "    Another  flick  of  the  lighter.\nSomeone  laughed,  a  shrill  cackling\nsound  that  made  me  jump.  Baba's\nhand  clamped  down  on  my  thigh.\nThe laughing man broke into song, a\nslurring,  off-key  rendition  of  an  old\nAfghan wedding song, delivered with\na thick Russian accent: Ahesta boro,\nMah-e-man, ahesta boro.<br><br>   Go  slowly,  my  lovely  moon,  go\nslowly.<br><br>   Boot  heels  clicked  on  asphalt.\nSomeone  flung  open  the  tarpaulin\nhanging  over  the  back  of  the  truck,\nand  three  faces  peered  in.  One  was\nKarim,  the  other  two  were  soldiers,\none  Afghan,  the  other  a  grinning\nRussian,  face  like  a  bulldog's,\ncigarette dangling from the side of his\nmouth.  Behind  them,  a  bone-colored\nmoon hung in the sky. Karim and the\nAfghan  soldier  had  a  brief  exchange\nin  Pashtu.  I  caught  a  little  of\nit--something about Toor and his bad\nluck.  The  Russian  soldier  thrust  his", "face into the rear of the truck. He was\nhumming  the  wedding  song  and\ndrumming  his  finger  on  the  edge  of\nthe  tailgate.  Even  in  the  dim  light  of\nthe  moon,  I  saw  the  glazed  look  in\nhis  eyes  as  they  skipped  from\npassenger to passenger. Despite the\ncold,  sweat  streamed  from  his  brow.\nHis eyes settled on the young woman\nwearing the black shawl. He spoke in\nRussian  to  Karim  without  taking  his\neyes off her. Karim gave a curt reply\nin  Russian,  which  the  soldier\nreturned  with  an  even  curter  retort.\nThe  Afghan  soldier  said  something\ntoo, in a low, reasoning voice. But the\nRussian  soldier  shouted  something\nthat made the other two flinch. I could\nfeel  Baba  tightening  up  next  to  me.\nKarim cleared his throat, dropped his\nhead.  Said  the  soldier  wanted  a  half\nhour  with  the  lady  in  the  back  of  the\ntruck.<br><br> The young woman pulled the shawl\ndown  over  her  face.  Burst  into  tears.\nThe  toddler  sitting  in  her  husband's", "lap started crying too. The husband's\nface  had  become  as  pale  as  the\nmoon hovering above. He told Karim\nto ask \"Mister Soldier Sahib\" to show\na little mercy, maybe he had a sister\nor  a  mother,  maybe  he  had  a  wife\ntoo.  The  Russian  listened  to  Karim\nand barked a series of words.<br><br>     \"It's  his  price  for  letting  us  pass,\"\nKarim said. He couldn't bring himself\nto look the husband in the eye.<br><br> \"But we've paid a fair price already.\nHe's  getting  paid  good  money,\"  the\nhusband said.<br><br>   Karim  and  the  Russian  soldier\nspoke.  \"He  says...  he  says  every\nprice has a tax.\"<br><br>   That  was  when  Baba  stood  up.  It\nwas  my  turn  to  clamp  a  hand  on  his\nthigh,  but  Baba  pried  it  loose,\nsnatched  his  leg  away.  When  he\nstood,  he  eclipsed  the  moonlight.  \"I\nwant you to ask this man something,\"\nBaba  said.  He  said  it  to  Karim,  but", "looked directly at the Russian officer.\n\"Ask him where his shame is.\"<br><br>   They  spoke.  \"He  says  this  is  war.\nThere is no shame in war.\"<br><br>   \"Tell  him  he's  wrong.  War  doesn't\nnegate  decency.  It  demands  it,  even\nmore than in times of peace.\"<br><br> Do you have to always be the hero?\nI  thought,  my  heart  fluttering.  Can't\nyou just let it go for once? But I knew\nhe  couldn't--it  wasn't  in  his  nature.\nThe  problem  was,  his  nature  was\ngoing to get us all killed.<br><br> The Russian soldier said something\nto  Karim,  a  smile  creasing  his  lips.\n\"Agha  sahib,\"  Karim  said,  \"these\nRoussi  are  not  like  us.  They\nunderstand  nothing  about  respect,\nhonor.\"<br><br> \"What did he say?\"<br><br> \"He says he'll enjoy putting a bullet", "in  you  almost  as  much  as...\"  Karim\ntrailed  off,  but  nodded  his  head\ntoward  the  young  woman  who  had\ncaught  the  guard's  eye.  The  soldier\nflicked  his  unfinished  cigarette  and\nunholstered  his  handgun.  So  this  is\nwhere  Baba  dies,  I  thought.  This  is\nhow it's going to happen. In my head,\nI  said  a  prayer  I  had  learned  in\nschool.<br><br>  \"Tell him I'll take a thousand of his\nbullets  before  I  let  this  indecency\ntake  place,\"  Baba  said.  My  mind\nflashed  to  that  winter  day  six  years\nago.  Me,  peering  around  the  corner\nin  the  alley.  Kamal  and  Wali  holding\nHassan  down.  Assef's  buttock\nmuscles  clenching  and  unclenching,\nhis  hips  thrusting  back  and  forth.\nSome hero I had been, fretting about\nthe  kite.  Sometimes,  I  too  wondered\nif I was really Baba's son.<br><br>   The  bulldog-faced  Russian  raised\nhis gun.<br><br>   \"Baba,  sit  down  please,\"  I  said,", "tugging  at  his  sleeve.  \"I  think  he\nreally means to shoot you.\"<br><br>   Baba  slapped  my  hand  away.\n\"Haven't  I  taught  you  anything?\"  he\nsnapped.  He  turned  to  the  grinning\nsoldier.  \"Tell  him  he'd  better  kill  me\ngood with that first shot. Because if I\ndon't  go  down,  I'm  tearing  him  to\npieces, goddamn his father!\"<br><br>   The  Russian  soldier's  grin  never\nfaltered  when  he  heard  the\ntranslation.  He  clicked  the  safety  on\nthe gun. Pointed the barrel to Baba's\nchest. Heart pounding in my throat, I\nburied my face in my hands.<br><br> The gun roared.<br><br>   It's  done,  then.  I'm  eighteen  and\nalone. I have no one left in the world.\nBaba's  dead  and  now  I  have  to  bury\nhim. Where do I bury him? Where do\nI  go  after  that?  But  the  whirlwind  of\nhalf  thoughts  spinning  in  my  head\ncame  to  a  halt  when  I  cracked  my", "eyelids,  found  Baba  still  standing.  I\nsaw  a  second  Russian  officer  with\nthe others. It was from the muzzle of\nhis upturned gun that smoke swirled.\nThe  soldier  who  had  meant  to  shoot\nBaba  had  already  holstered  his\nweapon.  He  was  shuffling  his  feet.  I\nhad  never  felt  more  like  crying  and\nlaughing at the same time.<br><br>   The  second  Russian  officer,\ngray-haired  and  heavyset,  spoke  to\nus in broken Farsi. He apologized for\nhis  comrade's  behavior.  \"Russia\nsends  them  here  to  fight,\"  he  said.\n\"But  they  are  just  boys,  and  when\nthey  come  here,  they  find  the\npleasure  of  drug.\"  He  gave  the\nyounger  officer  the  rueful  look  of  a\nfather \nexasperated  with  his  misbehaving\nson.  \"This  one  is  attached  to  drug\nnow. I try to stop him...\" He waved us\noff.<br><br>   Moments  later,  we  were  pulling\naway.  I  heard  a  laugh  and  then  the", "first soldier's voice, slurry and off-key,\nsinging the old wedding song.<br><br>\nWE  RODE  IN  SILENCE  for  about\nfifteen  minutes  before  the  young\nwoman's  husband  suddenly  stood\nand  did  something  I'd  seen  many\nothers  do  before  him:  He  kissed\nBaba's hand.<br><br>\nTOOR'S  BAD  LUCK.  Hadn't  I\noverheard  that  in  a  snippet  of\nconversation  back  at  Mahipar?  We\nrolled  into  Jalalabad  about  an  hour\nbefore  sunrise.  Karim  ushered  us\nquickly from the truck into a one-story\nhouse  at  the  intersection  of  two  dirt\nroads lined with flat one-story homes,\nacacia  trees,  and  closed  shops.  I\npulled  the  collar  of  my  coat  against\nthe chill as we hurried into the house,\ndragging  our  belongings.

Then  he\ntook  a  deep  breath  and  gave  us  the\nbad  news:  His  brother  Toor  couldn't\ntake  us  to  Peshawar.  It  seemed  his\ntruck's  engine  had  blown  the  week\nbefore  and  Toor  was  still  waiting  for\nparts.<br><br>   \"Last  week?\"  someone  exclaimed.\n\"If  you  knew  this,  why  did  you  bring\nus here?\"<br><br> I caught a flurry of movement out of\nthe  corner  of  my  eye.  Then  a  blur  of\nsomething  zipping  across  the  room,\nand  the  next  thing  I  saw  was  Karim\nslammed  against  the  wall,  his\nsandaled  feet  dangling  two  feet\nabove  the  floor.  Wrapped  around  his\nneck were Baba's hands. <br><br>   \"I'll  tell  you  why,\"  Baba  snapped.\n\"Because  he  got  paid  for  his  leg  of", "the  trip.  That's  all  he  cared  about.\"\nKarim  was  making  guttural  choking\nsounds.  Spittle  dripped  from  the\ncorner of his mouth.<br><br>   \"Put  him  down,  Agha,  you're  killing\nhim,\" one of the passengers said.<br><br> \"It's what I intend to do,\" Baba said.\nWhat  none  of  the  others  in  the  room\nknew  was  that  Baba  wasn't  joking.\nKarim was turning red and kicking his\nlegs. Baba kept choking him until the\nyoung  mother,  the  one  the  Russian\nofficer  had  fancied,  begged  him  to\nstop.<br><br>   Karim  collapsed  on  the  floor  and\nrolled  around  fighting  for  air  when\nBaba  finally  let  go.  The  room  fell\nsilent.  Less  than  two  hours  ago,\nBaba had volunteered to take a bullet\nfor  the  honor  of  a  woman  he  didn't\neven know. Now he'd almost choked\na  man  to  death,  would  have  done  it\ncheerfully  if  not  for  the  pleas  of  that\nsame woman. ", "    Something  thumped  next  door.  No,\nnot next door, below.<br><br> \"What's that?\" someone asked.<br><br> \"The others,\" Karim panted between\nlabored breaths. \"In the basement.\"<br><br> \"How long have they been waiting?\"\nBaba said, standing over Karim.<br><br> \"Two weeks.\"<br><br>   \"I  thought  you  said  the  truck  broke\ndown last week.\"<br><br>   Karim  rubbed  his  throat.  \"It  might\nhave  been  the  week  before,\"  he\ncroaked.<br><br> \"How long?\"<br><br>  \"What?\"<br><br>   \"How  long  for  the  parts?\"  Baba\nroared.

We\ndescended  in  single  file.  The  steps\ngroaned  under  Baba's  weight.\nStanding  in  the  cold  basement,  I  felt\nwatched by eyes blinking in the dark.\nI  saw  shapes  huddled  around  the\nroom,  their  silhouettes  thrown  on  the\nwalls  by  the  dim  light  of  a  pair  of\nkerosene  lamps.  A  low  murmur\nbuzzed  through  the  basement,\nbeneath  it  the  sound  of  water  drops\ntrickling  somewhere,  and,  something\nelse, a scratching sound.<br><br>   Baba  sighed  behind  me  and\ndropped the bags.<br><br>   Karim  told  us  it  should  be  a  matter", "of  a  couple  of  short  days  before  the\ntruck was fixed. Then we'd be on our\nway to Peshawar. On to freedom.

Rats.<br><br>\nONCE  MY  EYES  ADJUSTED  to  the\ndark,  I  counted  about  thirty  refugees\nin that basement. We sat shoulder to\nshoulder  along  the  walls,  ate\ncrackers,  bread  with  dates,  apples.\nThat  first  night,  all  the  men  prayed\ntogether.  One  of  the  refugees  asked\nBaba  why  he  wasn't  joining  them.\n\"God  is  going  to  save  us  all.  Why\ndon't you pray to him?\" <br><br>   Baba  snorted  a  pinch  of  his  snuff.\nStretched his legs. \"What'll save us is\neight  cylinders  and  a  good\ncarburetor.\"  That  silenced  the  rest  of\nthem  for  good  about  the  matter  of", "God.<br><br>   It  was  later  that  first  night  when  I\ndiscovered  that  two  of  the  people\nhiding  with  us  were  Kamal  and  his\nfather.  That  was  shocking  enough,\nseeing Kamal sitting in the basement\njust  a  few  feet  away  from  me.  But\nwhen he and his father came over to\nour  side  of  the  room  and  I  saw\nKamal's face, really saw it...<br><br>   He  had  withered--there  was  simply\nno  other  word  for  it.  His  eyes  gave\nme  a  hollow  look  and  no  recognition\nat  all  registered  in  them.  His\nshoulders  hunched  and  his  cheeks\nsagged  like  they  were  too  tired  to\ncling to the bone beneath. His father,\nwho'd  owned  a  movie  theater  in\nKabul,  was  telling  Baba  how,  three\nmonths  before,  a  stray  bullet  had\nstruck  his  wife  in  the  temple  and\nkilled  her.  Then  he  told  Baba  about\nKamal.  I  caught  only  snippets  of  it:\nShould have never let him go alone...\nalways  so  handsome,  you  know...", "four  of  them...  tried  to  fight...  God...\ntook him... bleeding down there... his\npants...  doesn't  talk  any  more...  just\nstares...<br><br>\nTHERE  WOULD  BE  NO  TRUCK,\nKarim told us after we'd spent a week\nin  the  rat-infested  basement.  The\ntruck was beyond repair.<br><br>   \"There  is  another  option,\"  Karim\nsaid,  his  voice  rising  amid  the\ngroans. His cousin owned a fuel truck\nand  had  smuggled  people  with  it  a\ncouple  of  times.  He  was  here  in\nJalalabad  and  could  probably  fit  us\nall.<br><br>   Everyone  except  an  elderly  couple\ndecided to go.<br><br>   We  left  that  night,  Baba  and  I,\nKamal  and  his  father,  the  others.\nKarim and his cousin, a square-faced\nbalding  man  named  Aziz,  helped  us", "get into the fuel tank.<br><br> One by one, we mounted the idling\ntruck's  rear  deck,  climbed  the  rear\naccess ladder, and slid down into the\ntank.  I  remember  Baba  climbed\nhalfway  up  the  ladder,  hopped  back\ndown  and  fished  the  snuffbox  from\nhis  pocket.  He  emptied  the  box  and\npicked  up  a  handful  of  dirt  from  the\nmiddle of the unpaved \nroad.  He  kissed  the  dirt.  Poured  it\ninto  the  box.  Stowed  the  box  in  his\nbreast pocket, next to his heart.<br><br>\nPANIC.<br><br>   You  open  your  mouth.  Open  it  so\nwide your jaws creak.

But you have to breathe to\nscream.<br><br> Panic.<br><br>   The  basement  had  been  dark.  The\nfuel  tank  was  pitch-black.  I  looked\nright, left, up, down, waved my hands\nbefore  my  eyes,  didn't  see  so  much\nas  a  hint  of  movement.  I  blinked,\nblinked  again.  Nothing  at  all.  The  air\nwasn't  right,  it  was  too  thick,  almost\nsolid. Air wasn't supposed to be solid.\nI wanted to reach out with my hands,\ncrush  the  air  into  little  pieces,  stuff\nthem  down  my  windpipe.  And  the\nstench  of  gasoline.  My  eyes  stung\nfrom  the  fumes,  like  someone  had\npeeled  my  lids  back  and  rubbed  a\nlemon  on  them.  My  nose  caught  fire\nwith  each  breath.

I was so afraid I'd lose them, I\ndidn't dare blink.<br><br>   Slowly  I  became  aware  of  my\nsurroundings.  I  heard  groans  and\nmuttered prayers. I heard a baby cry,\nits  mother's  muted  soothing.\nSomeone  retched.  Someone  else\ncursed  the  Shorawi.

Something\nhappy.  I  let  my  mind  wander.  I  let  it\ncome:  Friday  afternoon  in  Paghman.\nAn  open  field  of  grass  speckled  with\nmulberry  trees  in  blossom.

Not  a  word  passes\nbetween  us,  not  because  we  have\nnothing to say, but because we don't\nhave  to  say  anything--that's  how  it  is\nbetween people who are each other's\nfirst  memories,  people  who  have  fed\nfrom the same breast. A breeze stirs\nthe  grass  and  Hassan  lets  the  spool\nroll.  The  kite  spins,  dips,  steadies.\nOur  twin  shadows  dance  on  the\nrippling grass. From somewhere over\nthe low brick wall at the other end of\nthe  field,  we  hear  chatter  and\nlaughter  and  the  chirping  of  a  water\nfountain.  And  music,  some  thing  old\nand familiar, I think it's Ya Mowlah on\nrubab  strings.  Someone  calls  our\nnames over the wall, says it's time for\ntea and cake.<br><br>   I  didn't  remember  what  month  that\nwas,  or  what  year  even.

Through\nthe upside down V between his legs,\nI  saw  the  truck  idling  on  the  side  of\nthe road, the other refugees climbing\ndown  the  rear  ladder.  Beyond  that,\nthe  dirt  road  unrolled  through  fields\nthat  were  like  leaden  sheets  under\nthe gray sky and disappeared behind\na line of bowl-shaped hills. Along the\nway,  it  passed  a  small  village  strung\nout atop a sun baked slope.<br><br>   My  eyes  returned  to  our  suitcases.\nThey  made  me  sad  for  Baba.

No,  not\nscreaming.  Wailing.  I  saw  the\npassengers huddled in a circle, heard\ntheir  urgent  voices.  Someone  said\nthe word \"fumes.\" Someone else said\nit  too.  The  wail  turned  into  a\nthroat-ripping screech.<br><br>   Baba  and  I  hurried  to  the  pack  of\nonlookers  and  pushed  our  way\nthrough  them.

A  moment  later,  Kamal's\nfather was standing with Karim's gun\nin his hand.<br><br> \"Don't shoot me!\" Karim cried.<br><br> But before any of us could say or do\na  thing,  Kamal's  father  shoved  the\nbarrel  in  his  own  mouth.

Baba\nwould  enlighten  me  with  his  politics\nduring  those  walks  with  long-winded\ndissertations.  \"There  are  only  three\nreal  men  in  this  world,  Amir,\"  he'd\nsay.

Baba would\nmeet  them  for  tea  and  rowt  cake  at\nthe  park,  drive  them  crazy  with  his\npolitics.  \"What  they  don't\nunderstand,\"  he'd  tell  me  later,  \"is\nthat religion has nothing to do with it.\"\nIn  Baba's  view,  Israel  was  an  island\nof  \"real  men\"  in  a  sea  of  Arabs  too\nbusy getting fat off their oil to care for\ntheir  own.  \"Israel  does  this,  Israel\ndoes  that,\"  Baba  would  say  in  a\nmock-Arabic  accent.  \"Then  do\nsomething  about  it!

A  man  to  be  reckoned  with,\nsomeone who \ntook  action  instead  of  wringing  his\nhands.  That  someone  came  in  the\nform  of  Ronald  Reagan.  And  when\nReagan  went  on  TV  and  called  the\nShorawi \"the Evil Empire,\" Baba went\nout  and  bought  a  picture  of  the\ngrinning  president  giving  a  thumbs\nup.

After  I'd  made  him\npromise  he  wouldn't  go  back  in,  I\nreturned  to  the  store  and  apologized\nto the Nguyens. Told them my father\nwas  going  through  a  difficult  time.  I\ngave  Mrs.  Nguyen  our  telephone\nnumber and address, and told her to\nget  an  estimate  for  the  damages.\n\"Please  call  me  as  soon  as  you\nknow.

Inevitably,\nsomeone  would  bring  a  set  of  tabla\nand someone else a harmonium. Tea\nwould  brew,  and  who  ever  had  a\npassing singing voice would sing until\nthe  sun  rose,  the  mosquitoes\nstopped buzzing, and clapping hands\ngrew sore.<br><br>   \"You  were  happier  there,  Baba.  It\nwas more like home,\" I said. ", "    \"Peshawar  was  good  for  me.  Not\ngood for you.\" <br><br> \"You work so hard here.\"<br><br>   \"It's  not  so  bad  now,\"  he  said,\nmeaning  since  he  had  become  the\nday  manager  at  the  gas  station.  But\nI'd  seen  the  way  he  winced  and\nrubbed his wrists on damp days. The\nway  sweat  erupted  on  his  forehead\nas  he  reached  for  his  bottle  of\nantacids  after  meals.  \"Besides,  I\ndidn't bring us here for me, did I?\"<br><br>   I  reached  across  the  table  and  put\nmy  hand  on  his.  My  student  hand,\nclean and soft, on his laborer's hand,\ngrubby and calloused. I thought of all\nthe  trucks,  train  sets,  and  bikes  he'd\nbought  me  in  Kabul.  Now  America.\nOne last gift for Amir.<br><br>   Just  one  month  after  we  arrived  in\nthe  U.S.,  Baba  found  a  job  off\nWashington  Boulevard  as  an\nassistant  at  a  gas  station  owned  by", "an Afghan acquaintance--he'd started\nlooking  for  work  the  same  week  we\narrived.  Six  days  a  week,  Baba\npulled  twelve-hour  shifts  pumping\ngas,  running  the  register,  changing\noil,  and  washing  windshields.  I'd\nbring  him  lunch  sometimes  and  find\nhim  looking  for  a  pack  of  cigarettes\non  the  shelves,  a  customer  waiting\non  the  other  side  of  the  oil-stained\ncounter, Baba's face drawn and pale\nunder  the  bright  fluorescent  lights.\nThe  electronic  bell  over  the  door\nwould  ding-dong  when  I  walked  in,\nand  Baba  would  look  over  his\nshoulder,  wave,  and  smile,  his  eyes\nwatering from fatigue.<br><br>   The  same  day  he  was  hired,  Baba\nand  I  went  to  our  eligibility  officer  in\nSan Jose, Mrs. Dobbins. She was an\noverweight  black  woman  with\ntwinkling  eyes  and  a  dimpled  smile.\nShe'd  told  me  once  that  she  sang  in\nchurch, and I believed her--she had a\nvoice  that  made  me  think  of  warm\nmilk  and  honey.  Baba  dropped  the", "stack  of  food  stamps  on  her  desk.\n\"Thank  you  but  I  don't  want,\"  Baba\nsaid. \"I work always. In Afghanistan I\nwork,  in  America  I  work.  Thank  you\nvery  much,  Mrs.  Dobbins,  but  I  don't\nlike it free money.\"<br><br> Mrs. Dobbins blinked. Picked up the\nfood stamps, looked from me to Baba\nlike  we  were  pulling  a  prank,  or\n\"slipping her a trick\" as Hassan used\nto say. \"Fifteen years I been doin' this\njob and nobody's ever done this,\" she\nsaid.  And  that  was  how  Baba  ended\nthose  humiliating  food  stamp\nmoments  at  the  cash  register  and\nalleviated  one  of  his  greatest  fears:\nthat an Afghan would see him buying\nfood  with  charity  money.  Baba\nwalked out of the welfare office like a\nman cured of a tumor.<br><br>\n  THAT  SUMMER  OF  1983,  I\ngraduated  from  high  school  at  the\nage of twenty, by far the oldest senior\ntossing  his  mortarboard  on  the", "football  field  that  day.  I  remember\nlosing Baba in the swarm of families,\nflashing  cameras,  and  blue  gowns.  I\nfound  him  near  the  twenty-yard  line,\nhands shoved in his pockets, camera\ndangling  on  his  chest.  He\ndisappeared  and  reappeared  behind\nthe  people  moving  between  us:\nsquealing  blue-clad  girls  hugging,\ncrying,  boys  high-fiving  their  fathers,\neach  other.  Baba's  beard  was\ngraying,  his  hair  thinning  at  the\ntemples,  and  hadn't  he  been  taller  in\nKabul?  He  was  wearing  his  brown\nsuit--his  only  suit,  the  same  one  he\nwore  to  Afghan  weddings  and\nfunerals--and the red tie I had bought\nfor his fiftieth birthday that year. Then\nhe  saw  me  and  waved.  Smiled.  He\nmotioned  for  me  to  wear  my\nmortarboard,  and  took  a  picture  of\nme  with  the  school's  clock  tower  in\nthe background. I smiled for him--in a\nway,  this  was  his  day  more  than\nmine.  He  walked  to  me,  curled  his\narm  around  my  neck,  and  gave  my\nbrow  a  single  kiss.  \"I  am  Moftakhir,", "Amir,\"  he  said.  Proud.  His  eyes\ngleamed  when  he  said  that  and  I\nliked  being  on  the  receiving  end  of\nthat look.<br><br>   He  took  me  to  an  Afghan  kabob\nhouse  in  Hayward  that  night  and\nordered  far  too  much  food.  He  told\nthe  owner  that  his  son  was  going  to\ncollege in the fall. I had debated him\nbriefly  about  that  just  before\ngraduation,  and  told  him  I  wanted  to\nget  a  job.  Help  out,  save  some\nmoney,  maybe  go  to  college  the\nfollowing  year.  But  he  had  shot  me\none  of  his  smoldering  Baba  looks,\nand  the  words  had  vaporized  on  my\ntongue.<br><br> After dinner, Baba took me to a bar\nacross the street from the restaurant.\nThe  place  was  dim,  and  the  acrid\nsmell  of  beer  I'd  always  disliked\npermeated the walls. Men in baseball\ncaps  and  tank  tops  played  pool,\nclouds  of  cigarette  smoke  hovering\nover  the  green  tables,  swirling  in  the", "fluorescent  light.  We  drew  looks,\nBaba  in  his  brown  suit  and  me  in\npleated slacks and sports jacket. We\ntook a seat at the bar, next to an old\nman,  his  leathery  face  sickly  in  the\nblue  glow  of  the  Michelob  sign\noverhead.  Baba  lit  a  cigarette  and\nordered  us  beers.  \"Tonight  I  am  too\nmuch  happy,\"  he  announced  to  no\none and everyone. \"Tonight I drinking\nwith my son. And one, please, for my\nfriend,\"  he  said,  patting  the  old  man\non the back. The old fellow tipped his\nhat  and  smiled.  He  had  no  upper\nteeth.<br><br>   Baba  finished  his  beer  in  three\ngulps  and  ordered  another.  He  had\nthree before I forced myself to drink a\nquarter  of  mine.  By  then  he  had\nbought  the  old  man  a  scotch  and\ntreated a foursome of pool players to\na  pitcher  of  Budweiser.  Men  shook\nhis  hand  and  clapped  him  on  the\nback. They drank to him. Someone lit\nhis  cigarette.  Baba  loosened  his  tie\nand  gave  the  old  man  a  handful  of", "quarters.  He  pointed  to  the  jukebox.\n\"Tell  him  to  play  his  favorite  songs,\"\nhe  said  to  me.  The  old  man  nodded\nand  gave  Baba  a  salute.  Soon,\ncountry  music  was  blaring,  and,  just\nlike that, Baba had started a party.<br><br>  At one point, Baba stood, raised his\nbeer,  spilling  it  on  the  sawdust  floor,\nand  yelled,  \"Fuck  the  Russia!\"  The\nbar's  laughter,  then  its  full-throated\necho  followed.  Baba  bought  another\nround of pitchers for everyone.<br><br> When we left, everyone was sad to\nsee  him  go.  Kabul,  Peshawar,\nHayward.  Same  old  Baba,  I  thought,\nsmiling.<br><br>   I  drove  us  home  in  Baba's  old,\nochre  yellow  Buick  Century.  Baba\ndozed  off  on  the  way,  snoring  like  a\njackhammer.  I  smelled  tobacco  on\nhim and alcohol, sweet and pungent.\nBut he sat up when I stopped the car\nand  said  in  a  hoarse  voice,  \"Keep\ndriving to the end of the block.\" ", "  \"Why, Baba?\"<br><br>   \"Just  go.\"  He  had  me  park  at  the\nsouth  end  of  the  street.  He  reached\nin  his  coat  pocket  and  handed  me  a\nset of keys. \"There,\" he said, pointing\nto the car in front of us. It was an old\nmodel  Ford,  long  and  wide,  a  dark\ncolor  I  couldn't  discern  in  the  moon\nlight.  \"It  needs  painting,  and  I'll  have\none  of  the  guys  at  the  station  put  in\nnew shocks, but it runs.\"<br><br>   I  took  the  keys,  stunned.  I  looked\nfrom him to the car.<br><br>   \"You'll  need  it  to  go  to  college,\"  he\nsaid.<br><br>   I  took  his  hand  in  mine.  Squeezed\nit.  My  eyes  were  tearing  over  and  I\nwas glad for the shadows that hid our\nfaces. \"Thank you, Baba.\"<br><br> We got out and sat inside the Ford.\nIt  was  a  Grand  Torino.  Navy  blue,\nBaba  said.  I  drove  it  around  the", "block,  testing  the  brakes,  the  radio,\nthe  turn  signals.  I  parked  it  in  the  lot\nof our apartment building and shut off\nthe  engine.  \"Tashakor,  Baba  jan,\"  I\nsaid.  I  wanted  to  say  more,  tell  him\nhow  touched  I  was  by  his  act  of\nkindness, how much I appreciated all\nthat  he  had  done  for  me,  all  that  he\nwas  still  doing.  But  I  knew  I'd\nembarrass  him.  \"Tashakor,\"  I\nrepeated instead. <br><br> He smiled and leaned back against\nthe  headrest,  his  forehead  almost\ntouching  the  ceiling.  We  didn't  say\nanything.  Just  sat  in  the  dark,\nlistened  to  the  tink-tink  of  the  engine\ncooling,  the  wail  of  a  siren  in  the\ndistance.  Then  Baba  rolled  his  head\ntoward me. \"I wish Hassan had been\nwith us today,\" he said.<br><br> A pair of steel hands closed around\nmy  windpipe  at  the  sound  of\nHassan's  name.  I  rolled  down  the\nwindow. Waited for the steel hands to\nloosen their grip. ", " \nI  WOULD  ENROLL  in  junior  college\nclasses in the fall, I told Baba the day\nafter  graduation.  He  was  drinking\ncold  black  tea  and  chewing\ncardamom  seeds,  his  personal\ntrusted  antidote  for  hang  over\nheadaches.<br><br> \"I think I'll major in English,\" I said. I\nwinced inside, waiting for his reply.<br><br> \"English?\"<br><br> \"Creative writing.\"<br><br> He considered this. Sipped his tea.\n\"Stories,  you  mean.  You'll  make  up\nstories.\"<br><br> I looked down at my feet.<br><br>   \"They  pay  for  that,  making  up\nstories?\"<br><br>   \"If  you're  good,\"  I  said.  \"And  if  you", "get discovered.\"<br><br>   \"How  likely  is  that,  getting\ndiscovered?\"<br><br> \"It happens,\" I said.<br><br>     He  nodded.  \"And  what  will  you  do\nwhile  you  wait  to  get  good  and  get\ndiscovered?  How  will  you  earn\nmoney?  If  you  marry,  how  will  you\nsupport your khanum?\"<br><br>   I  couldn't  lift  my  eyes  to  meet  his.\n\"I'll... find a job.\"<br><br>   \"Oh,\"  he  said.  \"Wah  wah!  So,  if  I\nunderstand,  you'll  study  several\nyears  to  earn  a  degree,  then  you'll\nget  a  chatti  job  like  mine,  one  you\ncould just as easily land today, on the\nsmall  chance  that  your  degree  might\nsomeday help you get... discovered.\"\nHe took a deep breath and sipped his\ntea.  Grunted  something  about\nmedical school, law school, and \"real\nwork.\" ", "  My cheeks burned and guilt coursed\nthrough  me,  the  guilt  of  indulging\nmyself  at  the  expense  of  his  ulcer,\nhis  black  fingernails  and  aching\nwrists. But I would stand my ground, I\ndecided.  I  didn't  want  to  sacrifice  for\nBaba  anymore.  The  last  time  I  had\ndone that, I had damned myself.<br><br>   Baba  sighed  and,  this  time,  tossed\na  whole  handful  of  cardamom  seeds\nin his mouth.<br><br>\nSOMETIMES,  I  GOT  BEHIND  the\nwheel  of  my  Ford,  rolled  down  the\nwindows,  and  drove  for  hours,  from\nthe  East  Bay  to  the  South  Bay,  up\nthe  Peninsula  and  back.  I  drove\nthrough the grids of cottonwood-lined\nstreets in our Fremont neighborhood,\nwhere  people  who'd  never  shaken\nhands with kings lived in shabby, flat\none-story  houses  with  barred\nwindows,  where  old  cars  like  mine\ndripped  oil  on  blacktop  driveways.", "Pencil  gray  chain-link  fences  closed\noff  the  backyards  in  our\nneighborhood.  Toys,  bald  tires,  and\nbeer  bottles  with  peeling  labels\nlittered  unkempt  front  lawns.  I  drove\npast  tree-shaded  parks  that  smelled\nlike bark, past strip malls big enough\nto  hold  five  simultaneous  Buzkashi\ntournaments.  I  drove  the  Torino  up\nthe  hills  of  Los  Altos,  idling  past\nestates  with  picture  windows  and\nsilver lions guarding the wrought-iron\ngates,  homes  with  cherub  fountains\nlining  the  manicured  walkways  and\nno  Ford  Torinos  in  the  drive  ways.\nHomes  that  made  Baba's  house  in\nWazir  Akbar  Khan  look  like  a\nservant's hut. <br><br>   I'd  get  up  early  some  Saturday\nmornings  and  drive  south  on\nHighway  17,  push  the  Ford  up  the\nwinding  road  through  the  mountains\nto  Santa  Cruz.  I  would  park  by  the\nold  lighthouse  and  wait  for  sunrise,\nsit in my car and watch the fog rolling\nin from the sea. In Afghanistan, I had\nonly  seen  the  ocean  at  the  cinema.", "Sitting  in  the  dark  next  to  Hassan,  I\nhad  always  wondered  if  it  was  true\nwhat  I'd  read,  that  sea  air  smelled\nlike  salt.  I  used  to  tell  Hassan  that\nsomeday  we'd  walk  on  a  strip  of\nseaweed-strewn beach, sink our feet\nin  the  sand,  and  watch  the  water\nrecede from our toes. The first time I\nsaw the Pacific, I almost cried. It was\nas  vast  and  blue  as  the  oceans  on\nthe movie screens of my childhood.<br><br>   Sometimes  in  the  early  evening,  I\nparked  the  car  and  walked  up  a\nfreeway  overpass.  My  face  pressed\nagainst the fence, I'd try to count the\nblinking  red  taillights  inching  along,\nstretching  as  far  as  my  eyes  could\nsee.  BMWs.  Saabs.  Porsches.  Cars\nI'd  never  seen  in  Kabul,  where  most\npeople  drove  Russian  Volgas,  old\nOpels, or Iranian Paikans.<br><br> Almost two years had passed since\nwe had arrived in the U.S., and I was\nstill  marveling  at  the  size  of  this\ncountry,  its  vastness.  Beyond  every", "freeway lay another freeway, beyond\nevery  city  another  city  hills  beyond\nmountains  and  mountains  beyond\nhills,  and,  beyond  those,  more  cities\nand more people.<br><br>   Long  before  the  Roussi  army\nmarched  into  Afghanistan,  long\nbefore  villages  were  burned  and\nschools destroyed, long before mines\nwere planted like seeds of death and\nchildren  buried  in  rock-piled  graves,\nKabul  had  become  a  city  of  ghosts\nfor me. A city of harelipped ghosts.<br><br> America was different. America was\na  river,  roaring  along,  unmindful  of\nthe  past.  I  could  wade  into  this  river,\nlet  my  sins  drown  to  the  bottom,  let\nthe  waters  carry  me  someplace  far.\nSomeplace  with  no  ghosts,  no\nmemories, and no sins.<br><br>   If  for  nothing  else,  for  that,  I\nembraced America.<br><br>", "THE  FOLLOWING  SUMMER,  the\nsummer  of  1984--the  summer  I\nturned  twenty-one--Baba  sold  his\nBuick  and  bought  a  dilapidated  '71\nVolkswagen bus for $550 from an old\nAfghan  acquaintance  who'd  been  a\nhigh-school science teacher in Kabul.\nThe  neighbors'  heads  turned  the\nafternoon  the  bus  sputtered  up  the\nstreet \nand  farted  its  way  across  our  lot.\nBaba  killed  the  engine  and  let  the\nbus  roll  silently  into  our  designated\nspot.  We  sank  in  our  seats,  laughed\nuntil  tears  rolled  down  our  cheeks,\nand,  more  important,  until  we  were\nsure  the  neighbors  weren't  watching\nanymore. The bus was a sad carcass\nof  rusted  metal,  shattered  windows\nreplaced  with  black  garbage  bags,\nbalding  tires,  and  upholstery\nshredded  down  to  the  springs.  But\nthe  old  teacher  had  reassured  Baba\nthat  the  engine  and  transmission\nwere sound and, on that account, the\nman hadn't lied. ", "  On Saturdays, Baba woke me up at\ndawn.  As  he  dressed,  I  scanned  the\nclassifieds  in  the  local  papers  and\ncircled  the  garage  sale  ads.  We\nmapped  our  route--Fremont,  Union\nCity, Newark, and Hayward first, then\nSan  Jose,  Milpitas,  Sunnyvale,  and\nCampbell  if  time  permitted.  Baba\ndrove  the  bus,  sipping  hot  tea  from\nthe  thermos,  and  I  navigated.  We\nstopped  at  garage  sales  and  bought\nknickknacks  that  people  no  longer\nwanted. We haggled over old sewing\nmachines,  one-eyed  Barbie  dolls,\nwooden  tennis  rackets,  guitars  with\nmissing  strings,  and  old  Electrolux\nvacuum  cleaners.  By  mid-afternoon,\nwe'd  filled  the  back  of  the  VW  bus\nwith  used  goods.  Then  early  Sunday\nmornings,  we  drove  to  the  San  Jose\nflea  market  off  Berryessa,  rented  a\nspot,  and  sold  the  junk  for  a  small\nprofit:  a  Chicago  record  that  we'd\nbought  for  a  quarter  the  day  before\nmight go for $1, or $4 for a set of five;\na ramshackle Singer sewing machine", "purchased  for  $10  might,  after  some\nbargaining, bring in $25.<br><br>   By  that  summer,  Afghan  families\nwere working an entire section of the\nSan  Jose  flea  market.  Afghan  music\nplayed  in  the  aisles  of  the  Used\nGoods  section.  There  was  an\nunspoken  code  of  behavior  among\nAfghans  at  the  flea  market:  You\ngreeted the guy across the aisle, you\ninvited him for a bite of potato bolani\nor  a  little  qabuli,  and  you  chatted.\nYou  offered  tassali,  condolences,  for\nthe  death  of  a  parent,  congratulated\nthe  birth  of  children,  and  shook  your\nhead  mournfully  when  the\nconversation  turned  to  Afghanistan\nand  the  Roussis--which  it  inevitably\ndid.  But  you  avoided  the  topic  of\nSaturday.  Because  it  might  turn  out\nthat the fellow across the isle was the\nguy  you'd  nearly  blindsided  at  the\nfreeway  exit  yesterday  in  order  to\nbeat him to a promising garage sale.<br><br>   The  only  thing  that  flowed  more", "than  tea  in  those  aisles  was  Afghan\ngossip.  The  flea  market  was  where\nyou  sipped  green  tea  with  almond\nkolchas, and learned whose daughter\nhad  broken  off  an  engagement  and\nrun  off  with  her  American  boyfriend,\nwho  used  to  be  Parchami--a\ncommunist--in  Kabul,  and  who  had\nbought  a  house  with  under-the-table\nmoney  while  still  on  welfare.  Tea,\nPolitics, and Scandal, the ingredients\nof  an  Afghan  Sunday  at  the  flea\nmarket.<br><br> I ran the stand sometimes as Baba\nsauntered  down  the  aisle,  hands\nrespectfully  pressed  to  his  chest,\ngreeting people he knew from Kabul:\nmechanics  and  tailors  selling\nhand-me-down  wool  coats  and\nscraped bicycle \nhelmets,  alongside  former\nambassadors,  out-of-work  surgeons,\nand university professors.<br><br>   One  early  Sunday  morning  in  July\n1984,  while  Baba  set  up,  I  bought", "two  cups  of  coffee  from  the\nconcession  stand  and  returned  to\nfind  Baba  talking  to  an  older,\ndistinguished-looking  man.  I  put  the\ncups  on  the  rear  bumper  of  the  bus,\nnext to the REAGAN/BUSH FOR '84\nsticker.<br><br>   \"Amir,\"  Baba  said,  motioning  me\nover, \"this is General Sahib, Mr. Iqbal\nTaheri.<br><br>   He  was  a  decorated  general  in\nKabul.  He  worked  for  the  Ministry  of\nDefense.\"<br><br>   Taheri.  Why  did  the  name  sound\nfamiliar?  The  general  laughed  like  a\nman used to attending formal parties\nwhere  he'd  laughed  on  cue  at  the\nminor  jokes  of  important  people.  He\nhad  wispy  silver-gray  hair  combed\nback  from  his  smooth,  tanned\nforehead,  and  tufts  of  white  in  his\nbushy  eye  brows.  He  smelled  like\ncologne  and  wore  an  iron-gray\nthree-piece suit, shiny from too many", "pressings; the gold chain of a pocket\nwatch dangled from his vest.<br><br>   \"Such  a  lofty  introduction,\"  he  said,\nhis  voice  deep  and  cultured.\n\"Salaam, bachem.\" Hello, my child.<br><br>   \"Salaam,  General  Sahib,\"  I  said,\nshaking  his  hand.  His  thin  hands\nbelied  a  firm  grip,  as  if  steel  hid\nbeneath the moisturized skin.<br><br> \"Amir is going to be a great writer,\"\nBaba said. I did a double take at this.\n\"He  has  finished  his  first  year  of\ncollege  and  earned  A's  in  all  of  his\ncourses.\"<br><br> \"Junior college,\" I corrected him.<br><br>   \"Mashallah,\"  General  Taheri  said.\n\"Will  you  be  writing  about  our\ncountry,  history  perhaps?\nEconomics?\" <br><br> \"I write fiction,\" I said, thinking of the\ndozen  or  so  short  stories  I  had\nwritten in the leather-bound notebook", "Rahim  Khan  had  given  me,\nwondering  why  I  was  suddenly\nembarrassed  by  them  in  this  man's\npresence.<br><br> \"Ah, a storyteller,\" the general said.\n\"Well,  people  need  stories  to  divert\nthem  at  difficult  times  like  this.\"  He\nput his hand on Baba's shoulder and\nturned  to  me.  \"Speaking  of  stories,\nyour  father  and  I  hunted  pheasant\ntogether  one  summer  day  in\nJalalabad,\"  he  said.  \"It  was  a\nmarvelous  time.  If  I  recall  correctly,\nyour  father's  eye  proved  as  keen  in\nthe hunt as it had in business.\"<br><br> Baba kicked a wooden tennis racket\non  our  tarpaulin  spread  with  the  toe\nof his boot. \"Some business.\"<br><br>   General  Taheri  managed  a\nsimultaneously  sad  and  polite  smile,\nheaved  a  sigh,  and  gently  patted\nBaba's  shoulder.  \"Zendagi  migzara,\"\nhe  said.  Life  goes  on.  He  turned  his\neyes  to  me.  \"We  Afghans  are  prone", "to  a  considerable  degree  of\nexaggeration,  bachem,  and  I  have\nheard  many  men  foolishly  labeled\ngreat.  But  your  father  has  the\ndistinction  of  belonging  to  the\nminority  who  truly  deserves  the\nlabel.\"  This  little  speech  sounded  to\nme  the  way  his  suit  looked:  often\nused and unnaturally shiny.<br><br> \"You're flattering me,\" Baba said.<br><br>   \"I  am  not,\"  the  general  said,  tilting\nhis  head  sideways  and  pressing  his\nhand  to  his  chest  to  convey  humility.\n\"Boys and girls must know the legacy\nof  their  fathers.\"  He  turned  to  me.\n\"Do  you  appreciate  your  father,\nbachem?  Do  you  really  appreciate\nhim?\"<br><br> \"Balay, General Sahib, I do,\" I said,\nwishing he'd not call me \"my child.\"<br><br>   \"Then  congratulations,  you  are\nalready  halfway  to  being  a  man,\"  he\nsaid with no trace of humor, no irony,", "the  compliment  of  the  casually\narrogant.<br><br>   \"Padar  jan,  you  forgot  your  tea.\"  A\nyoung  woman's  voice.

Eyes\nnarrowing with keen interest.<br><br> What was this? Up to that point, our\nencounter  could  have  been\ninterpreted  as  a  respectful  inquiry,\none  man  asking  for  the  whereabouts\nof  another  man.

I was about to say more when\nthe woman I'd seen on occasion with\nSoraya  came  walking  up  the  aisle.\nShe was carrying a plastic bag full of\nfruit.  When  she  saw  us,  her  eyes\nbounced  from  Soraya  to  me  and\nback. She smiled.<br><br>   \"Amir  jan,  good  to  see  you,\"  she\nsaid,  unloading  the  bag  on  the\ntablecloth.  Her  brow  glistened  with  a\nsheen  of  sweat.  Her  red  hair,  coiffed\nlike  a  helmet,  glittered  in  the\nsunlight--I could see bits of her scalp\nwhere the hair had thinned. She had\nsmall  green  eyes  buried  in  a\ncabbage-round  face,  capped  teeth,\nand  little  fingers  like  sausages.  A\ngolden Allah rested on her chest, the\nchain  burrowed  under  the  skin  tags\nand  folds  of  her  neck.  \"I  am  Jamila,\nSoraya jan's mother.\"<br><br>   \"Salaam,  Khala  jan,\"  I  said,\nembarrassed,  as  I  often  was  around", "Afghans, that she knew me and I had\nno idea who she was.<br><br> \"How is your father?\" she said.<br><br> \"He's well, thank you.\"<br><br> \"You know, your grandfather, Ghazi\nSahib, the judge? Now, his uncle and\nmy  grandfather  were  cousins,\"  she\nsaid.  \"So  you  see,  we're  related.\"\nShe  smiled  a  cap-toothed  smile,  and\nI  noticed  the  right  side  of  her  mouth\ndrooping  a  little.

But he wouldn't\nsay more--Baba knew how lethal idle\ntalk could prove to a young woman's\nprospects  of  marrying  well.

I\nreplayed  our  conversation  over  and\nover  in  my  head.  Had  she  said  I\nheard  you  write  or  I  heard  you're  a\nwriter?  Which  was  it?  I  tossed  in  my\nsheets  and  stared  at  the  ceiling,\ndismayed  at  the  thought  of  six\nlaborious,  interminable  nights  of\nyelda until I saw her again.<br><br>\nIT  WENT  ON  LIKE  THAT  for  a  few\nweeks. I'd wait until the general went\nfor  a  stroll,  then  I'd  walk  past  the\nTaheris' stand. If Khanum Taheri was\nthere,  she'd  offer  me  tea  and  a\nkolcha  and  we'd  chat  about  Kabul  in\nthe  old  days,  the  people  we  knew,\nher  arthritis.  Undoubtedly,  she  had", "noticed  that  my  appearances  always\ncoincided  with  her  husband's\nabsences,  but  she  never  let  on.  \"Oh\nyou  just  missed  your  Kaka,\"  she'd\nsay.  I  actually  liked  it  when  Khanum\nTaheri  was  there,  and  not  just\nbecause  of  her  amiable  ways;\nSoraya  was  more  relaxed,  more\ntalkative  with  her  mother  around.  As\nif  her  presence  legitimized  whatever\nwas  happening  between  us--though\ncertainly not to the same degree that\nthe  general's  would  have.  Khanum\nTaheri's  chaperoning  made  our\nmeetings,  if  not  gossip-proof,  then\nless  gossip-worthy,  even  if  her\nborderline  fawning  on  me  clearly\nembarrassed Soraya.<br><br>   One  day,  Soraya  and  I  were  alone\nat their booth, talking. She was telling\nme  about  school,  how  she  too  was\nworking  on  her  general  education\nclasses,  at  Ohlone  Junior  College  in\nFremont.<br><br> \"What will you major in?\" ", "  \"I want to be a teacher,\" she said.<br><br> \"Really? Why?\"<br><br>   \"I've  always  wanted  to.  When  we\nlived  in  Virginia,  I  became  ESL\ncertified and now I teach at the public\nlibrary  one  night  a  week.  My  mother\nwas  a  teacher  too,  she  taught  Farsi\nand  history  at  Zarghoona  High\nSchool for girls in Kabul.\"<br><br>   A  potbellied  man  in  a  deerstalker\nhat  offered  three  dollars  for  a\nfive-dollar  set  of  candlesticks  and\nSoraya  let  him  have  it.  She  dropped\nthe money in a little \ncandy box by her feet. She looked at\nme shyly. \"I want to tell you a story,\"\nshe said, \"but I'm a little embarrassed\nabout it.\"<br><br> \"Tell me.\"<br><br> \"It's kind of silly.\" ", "  \"Please tell me.\"<br><br>   She  laughed.  \"Well,  when  I  was  in\nfourth grade in Kabul, my father hired\na woman named Ziba to help around\nthe house. She had a sister in Iran, in\nMashad,  and,  since  Ziba  was\nilliterate,  she'd  ask  me  to  write  her\nsister  letters  once  in  a  while.  And\nwhen  the  sister  replied,  I'd  read  her\nletter to Ziba. One day, I asked her if\nshe'd  like  to  learn  to  read  and  write.\nShe gave me this big smile, crinkling\nher  eyes,  and  said  she'd  like  that\nvery much. So we'd sit at the kitchen\ntable  after  I  was  done  with  my  own\nschoolwork  and  I'd  teach  her\nAlef-beh.

His\nexpressionless  eyes  bore  into  mine.", "\"You  see,  everyone  here  is  a\nstoryteller.\"  He  smiled,  revealing\nperfectly  even  teeth.  \"Do  pass  my\nrespects to your father, Amir jan.\"<br><br> He dropped his hand. Smiled again.\n<br><br>\n\"WHAT'S  WRONG?\"  Baba  said.  He\nwas  taking  an  elderly  woman's\nmoney for a rocking horse.<br><br>   \"Nothing,\"  I  said.  I  sat  down  on  an\nold TV set. Then I told him anyway.<br><br> \"Akh, Amir,\" he sighed.<br><br> As it turned out, I didn't get to brood\ntoo much over what had happened.<br><br>   Because  later  that  week,  Baba\ncaught a cold.<br><br>\nIT  STARTED  WITH  A  HACKING", "COUGH and the sniffles. He got over\nthe  sniffles,  but  the  cough  persisted.\nHe'd hack into his handkerchief, stow\nit in his pocket. I kept after him to get\nit  checked,  but  he'd  wave  me  away.\nHe  hated  doctors  and  hospitals.  To\nmy  knowledge,  the  only  time  Baba\nhad  ever  gone  to  a  doctor  was  the\ntime he'd caught malaria in India.<br><br> Then, two weeks later, I caught him\ncoughing  a  wad  of  blood-stained\nphlegm into the toilet.<br><br>   \"How  long  have  you  been  doing\nthat?\" I said.<br><br> \"What's for dinner?\" he said.<br><br> \"I'm taking you to the doctor.\"<br><br>   Even  though  Baba  was  a  manager\nat  the  gas  station,  the  owner  hadn't\noffered  him  health  insurance,  and\nBaba,  in  his  recklessness,  hadn't\ninsisted. So I \ntook him to the county hospital in San", "Jose.  The  sallow,  puffy-eyed  doctor\nwho  saw  us  introduced  himself  as  a\nsecond-year  resident.  \"He  looks\nyounger  than  you  and  sicker  than\nme,\"  Baba  grumbled.  The  resident\nsent  us  down  for  a  chest  X-ray.\nWhen  the  nurse  called  us  back  in,\nthe resident was filling out a form.<br><br>   \"Take  this  to  the  front  desk,\"  he\nsaid, scribbling quickly.<br><br> \"What is it?\" I asked.<br><br> \"A referral.\" Scribble scribble.<br><br> \"For what?\"<br><br> \"Pulmonary clinic.\"<br><br> \"What's that?\"<br><br> He gave me a quick glance. Pushed\nup  his  glasses.  Began  scribbling\nagain.  \"He's  got  a  spot  on  his  right\nlung. I want them to check it out.\" ", "  \"A spot?\" I said, the room suddenly\ntoo small.<br><br> \"Cancer?\" Baba added casually.<br><br>   \"Possible.  It's  suspicious,  anyway,\"\nthe doctor muttered.<br><br> \"Can't you tell us more?\" I asked.<br><br>   \"Not  really.  Need  a  CAT  scan  first,\nthen see the lung doctor.\" He handed\nme  the  referral  form.  \"You  said  your\nfather smokes, right?\" <br><br> \"Yes.\"<br><br>   He  nodded.  Looked  from  me  to\nBaba  and  back  again.  \"They'll  call\nyou within two weeks.\"<br><br>   I  wanted  to  ask  him  how  I  was\nsupposed  to  live  with  that  word,\n\"suspicious,\"  for  two  whole  weeks.\nHow  was  I  supposed  eat,  work,\nstudy? How could he send me home\nwith  that  word?  I  took  the  form  and\nturned  it  in.  That  night,  I  waited  until", "Baba  fell  asleep,  and  then  folded  a\nblanket.  I  used  it  as  a  prayer  rug.\nBowing  my  head  to  the  ground,  I\nrecited half-forgotten verses from the\nKoran--verses  the  mullah  had  made\nus  commit  to  memory  in  Kabul--and\nasked  for  kindness  from  a  God  I\nwasn't  sure  existed.  I  envied  the\nmullah  now,  envied  his  faith  and\ncertainty.<br><br>   Two  weeks  passed  and  no  one\ncalled.  And  when  I  called  them,  they\ntold me they'd lost the referral. Was I\nsure  I  had  turned  it  in?  They  said\nthey  would  call  in  another  three\nweeks.  I  raised  hell  and  bargained\nthe  three  weeks  down  to  one  for  the\nCAT scan, two to see the doctor.<br><br> The visit with the pulmonologist, Dr.\nSchneider, was going well until Baba\nasked  him  where  he  was  from.  Dr.\nSchneider said Russia. Baba lost it.<br><br>   \"Excuse  us,  Doctor,\"  I  said,  pulling\nBaba  aside.  Dr.  Schneider  smiled", "and  stood  back,  stethoscope  still  in\nhand.<br><br>   \"Baba,  I  read  Dr.  Schneider's\nbiography  in  the  waiting  room.  He\nwas born in Michigan. Michigan! He's\nAmerican,  a  lot  more  American  than\nyou and I will ever be.\"<br><br>   \"I  don't  care  where  he  was  born,\nhe's  Roussi,\"  Baba  said,  grimacing\nlike  it  was  a  dirty  word.  \"His  parents\nwere  Roussi,  his  grandparents  were\nRoussi.  I  swear  on  your  mother's\nface  I'll  break  his  arm  if  he  tries  to\ntouch me.\"<br><br>   \"Dr.  Schneider's  parents  fled  from\nShorawi,  don't  you  see?  They\nescaped!\" <br><br>   But  Baba  would  hear  none  of  it.\nSometimes  I  think  the  only  thing  he\nloved  as  much  as  his  late  wife  was\nAfghanistan, his late country. I almost\nscreamed  with  frustration.  Instead,  I\nsighed  and  turned  to  Dr.  Schneider.\n\"I'm  sorry,  Doctor.  This  isn't  going  to", "work out.\"<br><br> The next pulmonologist, Dr. Amani,\nwas  Iranian  and  Baba  approved.  Dr.\nAmani,  a  soft-spoken  man  with  a\ncrooked  mustache  and  a  mane  of\ngray  hair,  told  us  he  had  reviewed\nthe  CAT  scan  results  and  that  he\nwould  have  to  perform  a  procedure\ncalled a bronchoscopy to get a piece\nof  the  lung  mass  for  pathology.  He\nscheduled  it  for  the  following  week.  I\nthanked him as I helped Baba out of\nthe  office,  thinking  that  now  I  had  to\nlive a whole week with this new word,\n\"mass,\" an even more ominous word\nthan  \"suspicious.\"  I  wished  Soraya\nwere there with me.<br><br> It turned out that, like Satan, cancer\nhad many names. Baba's was called\n\"Oat  Cell  Carcinoma.\"  Advanced.\nInoperable.  Baba  asked  Dr.  Amani\nfor a prognosis. Dr. Amani bit his lip,\nused  the  word  \"grave.\"  \"There  is\nchemotherapy,  of  course,\"  he  said.\n\"But it would only be palliative.\" ", "    \"What  does  that  mean?\"  Baba\nasked.<br><br>   Dr.  Amani  sighed.  \"It  means  it\nwouldn't  change  the  outcome,  just\nprolong it.\"<br><br>   \"That's  a  clear  answer,  Dr.  Amani.\nThank  you  for  that,\"  Baba  said.  \"But\nno  chemo-medication  for  me.\"  He\nhad  the  same  resolved  look  on  his\nface  as  the  day  he'd  dropped  the\nstack  of  food  stamps  on  Mrs.\nDobbins's desk.<br><br> \"But Baba--\"<br><br>   \"Don't  you  challenge  me  in  public,\nAmir.  Ever.  Who  do  you  think  you\nare?\"<br><br>\nTHE  RAIN  General  Taheri  had\nspoken  about  at  the  flea  market  was\na  few  weeks  late,  but  when  we", "stepped  out  of  Dr.  Amani's  office,\npassing cars sprayed grimy \nwater  onto  the  sidewalks.  Baba  lit  a\ncigarette.  He  smoked  all  the  way  to\nthe car and all the way home.<br><br> As he was slipping the key into the\nlobby  door,  I  said,  \"I  wish  you'd  give\nthe chemo a chance, Baba.\"<br><br> Baba pocketed the keys, pulled me\nout  of  the  rain  and  under  the\nbuilding's  striped  awning.  He\nkneaded  me  on  the  chest  with  the\nhand holding the cigarette. \"Bas! I've\nmade my decision.\"<br><br> \"What about me, Baba? What am I\nsupposed  to  do?\"  I  said,  my  eyes\nwelling up.<br><br>   A  look  of  disgust  swept  across  his\nrain-soaked  face.  It  was  the  same\nlook he'd give me when, as a kid, I'd\nfall, scrape my knees, and cry. It was\nthe crying that brought it on then, the\ncrying that brought it on now. \"You're", "twenty-two  years  old,  Amir!  A  grown\nman!  You...\"  he  opened  his  mouth,\nclosed  it,  opened  it  again,\nreconsidered.  Above  us,  rain\ndrummed  on  the  canvas  awning.\n\"What's  going  to  happen  to  you,  you\nsay?  All  those  years,  that's  what  I\nwas trying to teach you, how to never\nhave to ask that question.\"<br><br> He opened the door. Turned back to\nme.  \"And  one  more  thing.  No  one\nfinds out about this, you hear me? No\none.  I  don't  want  anybody's\nsympathy.\" Then he disappeared into\nthe  dim  lobby.  He  chain-smoked  the\nrest  of  that  day  in  front  of  the  TV.  I\ndidn't  know  what  or  whom  he  was\ndefying.  Me?  Dr.  Amani?  Or  maybe\nthe God he had never believed in.<br><br>\nFOR A WHILE, even cancer couldn't\nkeep  Baba  from  the  flea  market.  We\nmade  our  garage  sale  treks  on\nSaturdays,  Baba  the  driver  and  me", "the navigator, and set up our display\non  Sundays.  Brass  lamps.  Baseball\ngloves.  Ski  jackets  with  broken\nzippers. Baba greeted acquaintances\nfrom  the  old  country  and  I  haggled\nwith buyers over a dollar or two. Like\nany  of  it  mattered.  Like  the  day  I\nwould  become  an  orphan  wasn't\ninching  closer  with  each  closing  of\nshop.<br><br> Sometimes, General Taheri and his\nwife  strolled  by.  The  general,  ever\nthe diplomat, greeted me with a smile\nand his two-handed shake. But there\nwas a \nnew  reticence  to  Khanum  Taheri's\ndemeanor.  A  reticence  broken  only\nby her secret, droopy smiles and the\nfurtive,  apologetic  looks  she  cast  my\nway when the general's attention was\nengaged elsewhere.<br><br> I remember that period as a time of\nmany  \"firsts\":  The  first  time  I  heard\nBaba moan in the bathroom. The first\ntime  I  found  blood  on  his  pillow.  In", "over  three  years  running  the  gas\nstation,  Baba  had  never  called  in\nsick. Another first.<br><br>   By  Halloween  of  that  year,  Baba\nwas  getting  so  tired  by  mid-Saturday\nafternoon  that  he'd  wait  behind  the\nwheel  while  I  got  out  and  bargained\nfor  junk.  By  Thanksgiving,  he  wore\nout  before  noon.  When  sleighs\nappeared  on  front  lawns  and  fake\nsnow  on  Douglas  firs,  Baba  stayed\nhome  and  I  drove  the  VW  bus  alone\nup and down the peninsula.<br><br>   Sometimes  at  the  flea  market,\nAfghan acquaintances made remarks\nabout  Baba's  weight  loss.  At  first,\nthey were complimentary. They even\nasked  the  secret  to  his  diet.  But  the\nqueries  and  compliments  stopped\nwhen  the  weight  loss  didn't.  When\nthe  pounds  kept  shedding.  And\nshedding.  When  his  cheeks\nhollowed.  And  his  temples  melted.\nAnd  his  eyes  receded  in  their\nsockets. ", "  Then, one cool Sunday shortly after\nNew  Year's  Day,  Baba  was  selling  a\nlampshade  to  a  stocky  Filipino  man\nwhile  I  rummaged  in  the  VW  for  a\nblanket to cover his legs with.<br><br>   \"Hey,  man,  this  guy  needs  help!\"\nthe  Filipino  man  said  with  alarm.  I\nturned around and found Baba on the\nground.  His  arms  and  legs  were\njerking.<br><br> \"Komak!\" I cried. \"Somebody help!\"\nI ran to Baba. He was frothing at the\nmouth,  the  foamy  spittle  soaking  his\nbeard.  His  upturned  eyes  showed\nnothing but white.<br><br>   People  were  rushing  to  us.  I  heard\nsomeone  say  seizure.  Some  one\nelse  yelling,  \"Call  911!\"  I  heard\nrunning  footsteps.  The  sky  darkened\nas a crowd gathered around us.<br><br>   Baba's  spittle  turned  red.  He  was\nbiting  his  tongue.  I  kneeled  beside", "him  and  grabbed  his  arms  and  said\nI'm  here  Baba,  I'm  here,  you'll  be  all\nright,  I'm  right  here.  As  if  I  could\nsoothe  the  convulsions  out  of  him.\nTalk them into leaving \nmy  Baba  alone.  I  felt  a  wetness  on\nmy  knees.  Saw  Baba's  bladder  had\nlet go. Shhh, Baba jan, I'm here. Your\nson is right here.<br><br>\nTHE  DOCTOR,  white-bearded  and\nperfectly  bald,  pulled  me  out  of  the\nroom. \"I want to go over your father's\nCAT scans with you,\" he said. He put\nthe  films  up  on  a  viewing  box  in  the\nhallway  and  pointed  with  the  eraser\nend  of  his  pencil  to  the  pictures  of\nBaba's  cancer,  like  a  cop  showing\nmug shots of the killer to the victim's\nfamily. Baba's brain on those pictures\nlooked  like  cross  sections  of  a  big\nwalnut,  riddled  with  tennis\nball-shaped gray things.<br><br>   \"As  you  can  see,  the  cancer's", "metastasized,\" he said. \"He'll have to\ntake  steroids  to  reduce  the  swelling\nin  his  brain  and  anti-seizure\nmedications.  And  I'd  recommend\npalliative  radiation.  Do  you  know\nwhat that means?\"<br><br>   I  said  I  did.  I'd  become  conversant\nin cancer talk.<br><br>   \"All  right,  then,\"  he  said.  He\nchecked  his  beeper.  \"I  have  to  go,\nbut  you  can  have  me  paged  if  you\nhave any questions.\"<br><br> \"Thank you.\"<br><br>   I  spent  the  night  sitting  on  a  chair\nnext to Baba's bed.<br><br>\nTHE  NEXT  MORNING,  the  waiting\nroom down the hall was jammed with\nAfghans.  The  butcher  from  Newark.\nAn engineer who'd worked with Baba\non  his  orphanage.  They  filed  in  and", "paid  Baba  their  respects  in  hushed\ntones.  Wished  him  a  swift  recovery.\nBaba  was  awake  then,  groggy  and\ntired, but awake.<br><br> Midmorning, General Taheri and his\nwife  came.  Soraya  followed.  We\nglanced  at  each  other,  looked  away\nat  the  same  time.  \"How  are  you,  my\nfriend?\"  General  Taheri  said,  taking\nBaba's hand.<br><br>     Baba  motioned  to  the  IV  hanging\nfrom  his  arm.  Smiled  thinly.  The\ngeneral smiled back.<br><br>   \"You  shouldn't  have  burdened\nyourselves.  All  of  you,\"  Baba\ncroaked.<br><br>   \"It's  no  burden,\"  Khanum  Taheri\nsaid.<br><br> \"No burden at all. More importantly,\ndo  you  need  anything?\"  General\nTaheri said.<br><br>   \"Anything  at  all?  Ask  me  like  you'd", "ask a brother.\"<br><br> I remembered something Baba had\nsaid  about  Pashtuns  once.  We  may\nbe  hardheaded  and  I  know  we're  far\ntoo  proud,  but,  in  the  hour  of  need,\nbelieve  me  that  there's  no  one  you'd\nrather  have  at  your  side  than  a\nPashtun.<br><br> Baba shook his head on the pillow.\n\"Your  coming  here  has  brightened\nmy  eyes.\"  The  general  smiled  and\nsqueezed  Baba's  hand.  \"How  are\nyou,  Amir  jan?  Do  you  need\nanything?\"<br><br> The way he was looking at me, the\nkindness  in  his  eyes...  \"Nay  thank\nyou,  General  Sahib.  I'm...\"  A  lump\nshot  up  in  my  throat  and  my  eyes\nteared over. I bolted out of the room.<br><br> I wept in the hallway, by the viewing\nbox where, the night before, I'd seen\nthe killer's face. ", "    Baba's  door  opened  and  Soraya\nwalked  out  of  his  room.  She  stood\nnear  me.  She  was  wearing  a  gray\nsweatshirt  and  jeans.  Her  hair  was\ndown. I wanted to find comfort in her\narms.<br><br>   \"I'm  so  sorry,  Amir,\"  she  said.  \"We\nall  knew  something  was  wrong,  but\nwe had no idea it was this.\"<br><br>     I  blotted  my  eyes  with  my  sleeve.\n\"He didn't want anyone to know.\"<br><br> \"Do you need anything?\"<br><br>   \"No.\"  I  tried  to  smile.  She  put  her\nhand  on  mine.  Our  first  touch.  I  took\nit.  Brought  it  to  my  face.  My  eyes.  I\nlet it go. \"You'd better go back inside.\nOr your father will come after me.\"<br><br> She smiled and nodded. \"I should.\"\nShe turned to go. \"Soraya?\"<br><br> \"Yes?\"<br><br>   \"I'm  happy  you  came,  It  means...", "the world to me.\"<br><br>\nTHEY  DISCHARGED  BABA  two\ndays  later.  They  brought  in  a\nspecialist  called  a  radiation\noncologist  to  talk  Baba  into  getting\nradiation  treatment.  Baba  refused.\nThey tried to talk me into talking him\ninto  it.  But  I'd  seen  the  look  on\nBaba's  face.  I  thanked  them,  signed\ntheir  forms,  and  took  Baba  home  in\nmy Ford Torino.<br><br>   That  night,  Baba  was  lying  on  the\ncouch, a wool blanket covering him. I\nbrought  him  hot  tea  and  roasted\nalmonds.  Wrapped  my  arms  around\nhis back and pulled him up much too\neasily.  His  shoulder  blade  felt  like  a\nbird's wing under my fingers. I pulled\nthe  blanket  back  up  to  his  chest\nwhere  ribs  stretched  his  thin,  sallow\nskin.<br><br>   \"Can  I  do  anything  else  for  you,", "Baba?\"<br><br> \"Nay, bachem. Thank you.\" <br><br>   I  sat  beside  him.  \"Then  I  wonder  if\nyou'll  do  something  for  me.  If  you're\nnot too exhausted.\"<br><br> \"What?\"<br><br> \"I want you to go khastegari. I want\nyou  to  ask  General  Taheri  for  his\ndaughter's hand.\"<br><br>   Baba's  dry  lips  stretched  into  a\nsmile.  A  spot  of  green  on  a  wilted\nleaf. \"Are you sure?\"<br><br>   \"More  sure  than  I've  ever  been\nabout anything.\"<br><br> \"You've thought it over?\"<br><br> \"Balay, Baba.\"<br><br>   \"Then  give  me  the  phone.  And  my\nlittle notebook.\" ", "  I blinked. \"Now?\"<br><br> \"Then when?\"<br><br>   I  smiled.  \"Okay.\"  I  gave  him  the\nphone  and  the  little  black  notebook\nwhere Baba had scribbled his Afghan\nfriends' numbers.<br><br>   He  looked  up  the  Taheris.  Dialed.\nBrought  the  receiver  to  his  ear.  My\nheart  was  doing  pirouettes  in  my\nchest.<br><br>   \"Jamila  jan?  Salaam  alaykum,\"  he\nsaid. He introduced himself. Paused.\n\"Much  better,  thank  you.  It  was  so\ngracious of you to come.\" He listened\nfor a \nwhile.  Nodded.  \"I'll  remember  that,\nthank  you.  Is  General  Sahib  home?\"\nPause. \"Thank you.\"<br><br>   His  eyes  flicked  to  me.  I  wanted  to\nlaugh  for  some  reason.  Or  scream.  I\nbrought  the  ball  of  my  hand  to  my\nmouth  and  bit  on  it.  Baba  laughed", "softly through his nose.<br><br>   \"General  Sahib,  Salaam  alaykum...\nYes,  much  much  better...  Balay...\nYou're  so  kind.  General  Sahib,  I'm\ncalling  to  ask  if  I  may  pay  you  and\nKhanum  Taheri  a  visit  tomorrow\nmorning.  It's  an  honorable  matter...\nYes... Eleven o'clock is just fine. Until\nthen. Khoda hafez.\"<br><br>   He  hung  up.  We  looked  at  each\nother.  I  burst  into  giggles.  Baba\njoined in.<br><br>\nBABA WET HIS HAIR and combed it\nback. I helped him into a clean white\nshirt  and  knotted  his  tie  for  him,\nnoting the two inches of empty space\nbetween the collar button and Baba's\nneck.  I  thought  of  all  the  empty\nspaces  Baba  would  leave  behind\nwhen  he  was  gone,  and  I  made\nmyself  think  of  something  else.  He\nwasn't gone. Not yet. And this was a", "day  for  good  thoughts.  The  jacket  of\nhis  brown  suit,  the  one  he'd  worn  to\nmy  graduation,  hung  over  him--too\nmuch of Baba had melted away to fill\nit  anymore.  I  had  to  roll  up  the\nsleeves.  I  stooped  and  tied  his\nshoelaces for him.<br><br> The Taheris lived in a flat, one-story\nhouse in one of the residential areas\nin Fremont known for housing a large\nnumber  of  Afghans.  It  had  bay\nwindows,  a  pitched  roof,  and  an\nenclosed  front  porch  on  which  I  saw\npotted geraniums. The general's gray\nvan was parked in the driveway.<br><br>   I  helped  Baba  out  of  the  Ford  and\nslipped  back  behind  the  wheel.  He\nleaned in the passenger window. \"Be\nhome, I'll call you in an hour.\"<br><br> \"Okay, Baba,\" I said. \"Good luck.\"<br><br> He smiled.<br><br>     I  drove  away.  In  the  rearview\nmirror,  Baba  was  hobbling  up  the", "Taheris' driveway for one last fatherly\nduty.<br><br>\nI  PACED  THE  LIVING  ROOM  of  our\napartment  waiting  for  Baba's  call.\nFifteen  paces  long.  Ten  and  a  half\npaces  wide.  What  if  the  general  said\nno?  What  if  he  hated  me?  I  kept\ngoing  to  the  kitchen,  checking  the\noven clock.<br><br> The phone rang just before noon. It\nwas Baba.<br><br> \"Well?\"<br><br> \"The general accepted.\"<br><br> I let out a burst of air. Sat down. My\nhands were shaking. \"He did?\"<br><br>   \"Yes,  but  Soraya  jan  is  upstairs  in\nher  room.  She  wants  to  talk  to  you\nfirst.\" ", "  \"Okay.\"<br><br>   Baba  said  something  to  someone\nand  there  was  a  double  click  as  he\nhung up.<br><br> \"Amir?\" Soraya's voice. \"Salaam.\"<br><br> \"My father said yes.\"<br><br> \"I know,\" I said. I switched hands. I\nwas  smiling.  \"I'm  so  happy  I  don't\nknow what to say.\"<br><br>     \"I'm  happy  too,  Amir.  I...  can't\nbelieve this is happening.\"<br><br> I laughed. \"I know.\"<br><br> \"Listen,\" she said, \"I want to tell you\nsomething.  Something  you  have  to\nknow before...\"<br><br> \"I don't care what it is.\"<br><br> \"You need to know. I don't want us\nto  start  with  secrets.  And  I'd  rather\nyou hear it from me.\" ", "    \"If  it  will  make  you  feel  better,  tell\nme. But it won't change anything.\"<br><br> There was a long pause at the other\nend. \"When we lived in Virginia, I ran\naway  with  an  Afghan  man.  I  was\neighteen  at  the  time...  rebellious...\nstupid, and... he was into drugs... We\nlived together for almost a month.

I  couldn't  lie  to  her  and\nsay  that  my  pride,  my  iftikhar,  wasn't\nstung at all that she had been with a\nman,  whereas  I  had  never  taken  a\nwoman to bed. It did bother me a bit,\nbut  I  had  pondered  this  quite  a  lot  in\nthe weeks before I asked Baba to go\nkhastegari.  And  in  the  end  the\nquestion  that  always  came  back  to\nme  was  this:  How  could  I,  of  all\npeople,  chastise  someone  for  their\npast?  \"Does  it  bother  you  enough  to\nchange your mind?\" ", "    \"No,  Soraya.  Not  even  close,\"  I\nsaid.  \"Nothing  you  said  changes\nanything. I want us to marry.\"<br><br> She broke into fresh tears.<br><br>   I  envied  her.  Her  secret  was  out.\nSpoken.

I  suspected  there  were\nmany  ways  in  which  Soraya  Taheri\nwas  a  better  person  than  me.\nCourage was just one of them.", "#$#$Chapter 13#$#$<br><br>When  we  arrived  at  the  Taheris'\nhome  the  next  evening--for  Lafz,  the\nceremony  of  \"giving  word\"--I  had  to\npark the Ford across the street. Their\ndriveway  was  already  jammed  with\ncars.  I  wore  a  navy  blue  suit  I  had\nbought  the  previous  day,  after  I  had\nbrought  Baba  home  from  khastegari.\nI  checked  my  tie  in  the  rearview\nmirror.<br><br>     \"You  look  khoshteep,\"  Baba  said.\nHandsome.<br><br> \"Thank you, Baba. Are you all right?\nDo you feel up to this?\"<br><br> \"Up to this? It's the happiest day of\nmy life, Amir,\" he said, smiling tiredly.<br><br>I  COULD  HEAR  CHATTER  from  the", "other  side  of  the  door,  laughter,  and\nAfghan  music  playing  softly--it\nsounded  like  a  classical  ghazal  by\nUstad  Sarahang.  I  rang  the  bell.  A\nface  peeked  through  the  curtains  of\nthe  foyer  window  and  disappeared.\n\"They're  here!\"  I  heard  a  woman's\nvoice  say.  The  chatter  stopped.\nSomeone turned off the music.<br><br>   Khanum  Taheri  opened  the  door.\n\"Salaam  alaykum,\"  she  said,\nbeaming.  She'd  permed  her  hair,  I\nsaw,  and  wore  an  elegant,\nankle-length  black  dress.  When  I\nstepped  into  the  foyer,  her  eyes\nmoistened.  \"You're  barely  in  the\nhouse  and  I'm  crying  already,  Amir\njan,\" she said. I planted a kiss on her\nhand, just as Baba had instructed me\nto do the night before.<br><br>   She  led  us  through  a  brightly  lit\nhallway  to  the  living  room.  On  the\nwood-paneled walls, I saw pictures of\nthe  people  who  would  become  my\nnew  family:  A  young  bouffant-haired", "Khanum  Taheri  and  the\ngeneral--Niagara  Falls  in  the\nbackground;  Khanum  Taheri  in  a\nseamless  dress,  the  general  in  a\nnarrow-lapelled  jacket  and  thin  tie,\nhis hair full and black; Soraya, about\nto  board  a  wooden  roller  coaster,\nwaving  and  smiling,  the  sun  glinting\noff  the  silver  wires  in  her  teeth.  A\nphoto  of  the  general,  dashing  in  full\nmilitary  outfit,  shaking  hands  with\nKing  Hussein  of  Jordan.  A  portrait  of\nZahir Shah.<br><br>   The  living  room  was  packed  with\nabout  two  dozen  guests  seated  on\nchairs  placed  along  the  walls.  When\nBaba  entered,  everybody  stood  up.\nWe  went  around  the  room,  Baba\nleading  slowly,  me  behind  him,\nshaking  hands  and  greeting  the\nguests.  The  general--still  in  his  gray\nsuit--and  Baba  embraced,  gently\ntapping each other on the back. They\nsaid  their  Salaams  in  respectful\nhushed tones. <br><br> The general held me at arm's length", "and  smiled  knowingly,  as  if  saying,\n\"Now,  this  is  the  right  way--the\nAfghan  way--to  do  it,  bachem.\"  We\nkissed three times on the cheek.<br><br>   We  sat  in  the  crowded  room,  Baba\nand I next to each other, across from\nthe  general  and  his  wife.  Baba's\nbreathing  had  grown  a  little  ragged,\nand  he  kept  wiping  sweat  off  his\nforehead  and  scalp  with  his\nhandkerchief.  He  saw  me  looking  at\nhim and managed a strained grin. I'm\nall right,\" he mouthed.<br><br>   In  keeping  with  tradition,  Soraya\nwas not present.<br><br>   A  few  moments  of  small  talk  and\nidle chatter followed until the general\ncleared his throat. The room became\nquiet  and  everyone  looked  down  at\ntheir  hands  in  respect.  The  general\nnodded toward Baba.<br><br> Baba cleared his own throat. When\nhe  began,  he  couldn't  speak  in", "complete sentences without stopping\nto  breathe.  \"General  Sahib,  Khanum\nJamila  jan...  it's  with  great  humility\nthat  my  son  and  I...  have  come  to\nyour  home  today.

The moment I'd waited for.<br><br>   Soraya  appeared  at  the  end.\nDressed  in  a  stunning  wine-colored\ntraditional  Afghan  dress  with  long\nsleeves  and  gold  trimmings.  Baba's\nhand  took  mine  and  tightened.\nKhanum Taheri burst into fresh tears.\nSlowly,  Soraya  came  to  us,  tailed  by\na  procession  of  young  female\nrelatives.

Sat\nbeside  me  at  last,  her  eyes\ndowncast.<br><br> The applause swelled.<br><br>\nACCORDING  TO  TRADITION,\nSoraya's  family  would  have  thrown\nthe  engagement  party  the\nShirini-khori--or  \"Eating  of  the\nSweets\"  ceremony.  Then  an\nengagement  period  would  have\nfollowed  which  would  have  lasted  a\nfew  months.  Then  the  wedding,\nwhich would be paid for by Baba.<br><br>   We  all  agreed  that  Soraya  and  I\nwould  forgo  the  Shirini-khori.\nEveryone  knew  the  reason,  so  no\none  had  to  actually  say  it:  that  Baba\ndidn't have months to live.<br><br>   Soraya  and  I  never  went  out  alone\ntogether  while  preparations  for  the\nwedding  proceeded--since  we", "weren't  married  yet,  hadn't  even  had\na  Shirini-khori,  it  was  considered\nimproper.  So  I  had  to  make  do  with\ngoing  over  to  the  Taheris  with  Baba\nfor  dinner.  Sit  across  from  Soraya  at\nthe  dinner  table.  Imagine  what  it\nwould be like to feel her head on my\nchest, smell her hair. Kiss her. Make\nlove to her.<br><br>   Baba  spent  $35,000,  nearly  the\nbalance  of  his  life  savings,  on  the\nawroussi, the wedding ceremony. He\nrented a large Afghan banquet hall in\nFremont--the  man  who  owned  it\nknew him from Kabul and gave him a\nsubstantial  discount.  Baba  paid  for\nthe  chilas,  our  matching  wedding\nbands,  and  for  the  diamond  ring  I\npicked  out.  He  bought  my  tuxedo,\nand  my  traditional  green  suit  for  the\nnika--the  swearing  ceremony.  For  all\nthe frenzied preparations \nthat  went  into  the  wedding\nnight--most  of  it,  blessedly,  by\nKhanum  Taheri  and  her  friends--I\nremember only a handful of moments", "from it.<br><br>   I  remember  our  nika.  We  were\nseated  around  a  table,  Soraya  and  I\ndressed  in  green--the  color  of  Islam,\nbut  also  the  color  of  spring  and  new\nbeginnings. I wore a suit, Soraya (the\nonly  woman  at  the  table)  a  veiled\nlong-sleeved  dress.  Baba,  General\nTaheri  (in  a  tuxedo  this  time),  and\nseveral of Soraya's uncles were also\npresent  at  the  table.  Soraya  and  I\nlooked  down,  solemnly  respectful,\ncasting  only  sideways  glances  at\neach  other.  The  mullah  questioned\nthe  witnesses  and  read  from  the\nKoran. We said our oaths. Signed the\ncertificates.  One  of  Soraya's  uncles\nfrom  Virginia,  Sharif  jan,  Khanum\nTaheri's  brother,  stood  up  and\ncleared  his  throat.  Soraya  had  told\nme  that  he  had  lived  in  the  U.S.  for\nmore  than  twenty  years.  He  worked\nfor  the  INS  and  had  an  American\nwife.  He  was  also  a  poet.  A  small\nman  with  a  birdlike  face  and  fluffy\nhair,  he  read  a  lengthy  poem", "dedicated  to  Soraya,  jotted  down  on\nhotel  stationery  paper.  \"Wah  wah,\nSharif  jan!\"  everyone  exclaimed\nwhen he finished.<br><br>   I  remember  walking  toward  the\nstage,  now  in  my  tuxedo,  Soraya  a\nveiled  pan  in  white,  our  hands\nlocked. Baba hobbled next to me, the\ngeneral  and  his  wife  beside  their\ndaughter.  A  procession  of  uncles,\naunts,  and  cousins  followed  as  we\nmade  our  way  through  the  hall,\nparting  a  sea  of  applauding  guests,\nblinking  at  flashing  cameras.  One  of\nSoraya's  cousins,  Sharif  jan's  son,\nheld  a  Koran  over  our  heads  as  we\ninched  along.  The  wedding  song,\nahesta  boro,  blared  from  the\nspeakers,  the  same  song  the\nRussian  soldier  at  the  Mahipar\ncheckpoint  had  sung  the  night  Baba\nand I left Kabul: Make morning into a\nkey  and  throw  it  into  the  well,  Go\nslowly,  my  lovely  moon,  go  slowly.\nLet  the  morning  sun  forget  to  rise  in\nthe east, Go slowly, my lovely moon,", "go slowly.<br><br>   I  remember  sitting  on  the  sofa,  set\non  the  stage  like  a  throne,  Soraya's\nhand in mine, as three hundred or so\nfaces  looked  on.  We  did  Ayena\nMasshaf,  where  they  gave  us  a\nmirror  and  threw  a  veil  over  our\nheads,  so  we'd  be  alone  to  gaze  at\neach  other's  reflection.  Looking  at\nSoraya's smiling face in that mirror, in\nthe  momentary  privacy  of  the  veil,  I\nwhispered to her for the first time that\nI  loved  her.  A  blush,  red  like  henna,\nbloomed on her cheeks.<br><br>   I  picture  colorful  platters  of  chopan\nkabob,  sholeh-goshti,  and\nwild-orange rice. I see Baba between\nus  on  the  sofa,  smiling.  I  remember\nsweat-drenched  men  dancing  the\ntraditional attan in a circle, bouncing,\nspinning  faster  and  faster  with  the\nfeverish  tempo  of  the  tabla,  until  all\nbut a few dropped out of the ring with\nexhaustion.  I  remember  wishing\nRahim Khan were there.  ", "    And  I  remember  wondering  if\nHassan  too  had  married.  And  if  so,\nwhose face he had seen in the mirror\nunder the veil? Whose henna-painted\nhands had he held? <br><br>\nAROUND  2  A.M.,  the  party  moved\nfrom  the  banquet  hall  to  Baba's\napartment.  Tea  flowed  once  more\nand music played until the neighbors\ncalled  the  cops.  Later  that  night,  the\nsun less than an hour from rising and\nthe guests finally gone, Soraya and I\nlay  together  for  the  first  time.  All  my\nlife, I'd been around men. That night,\nI  discovered  the  tenderness  of  a\nwoman.<br><br>\nIT  WAS  SORAYA  who  suggested\nthat she move in with Baba and me.<br><br>   \"I  thought  you  might  want  us  to\nhave our own place,\" I said. ", "    \"With  Kaka  jan  as  sick  as  he  is?\"\nshe  replied.  Her  eyes  told  me  that\nwas  no  way  to  start  a  marriage.  I\nkissed her. \"Thank you.\"<br><br>   Soraya  dedicated  herself  to  taking\ncare of my father. She made his toast\nand  tea  in  the  morning,  and  helped\nhim in and out of bed. She gave him\nhis  pain  pills,  washed  his  clothes,\nread  him  the  international  section  of\nthe  newspaper  every  afternoon,  She\ncooked  his  favorite  dish,  potato\nshorwa, though he could scarcely eat\nmore than a few spoonfuls, and took\nhim  out  every  day  for  a  brief  walk\naround  the  block.  And  when  he\nbecame  bedridden,  she  turned  him\non his side every hour so he wouldn't\nget a bedsore.<br><br>   One  day,  I  came  home  from  the\npharmacy with Baba's morphine pills.\nJust  as  I  shut  the  door,  I  caught  a\nglimpse  of  Soraya  quickly  sliding\nsomething  under  Baba's  blanket.", "\"Hey, I saw that! What were you two\ndoing?\" I said.<br><br> \"Nothing,\" Soraya said, smiling. <br><br>   \"Liar.\"  I  lifted  Baba's  blanket.\n\"What's this?\" I said, though as soon\nas  I  picked  up  the  leather-bound\nbook,  I  knew.  I  traced  my  fingers\nalong  the  gold-stitched  borders.  I\nremembered  the  fire  works  the  night\nRahim  Khan  had  given  it  to  me,  the\nnight  of  my  thirteenth  birthday,  flares\nsizzling  and  exploding  into  bouquets\nof red, green, and yellow.<br><br>   \"I  can't  believe  you  can  write  like\nthis,\" Soraya said.<br><br>   Baba  dragged  his  head  off  the\npillow.  \"I  put  her  up  to  it.  I  hope  you\ndon't mind.\"<br><br> I gave the notebook back to Soraya\nand left the room. Baba hated it when\nI cried.<br><br>", "A  MONTH  AFTER  THE  WEDDING,\nthe  Taheris,  Sharif,  his  wife  Suzy,\nand  several  of  Soraya's  aunts  came\nover  to  our  apartment  for  dinner.\nSoraya  made  sabzi  challow--white\nrice  with  spinach  and  lamb.  After\ndinner,  we  all  had  green  tea  and\nplayed  cards  in  groups  of  four.\nSoraya  and  I  played  with  Sharif  and\nSuzy  on  the  coffee  table,  next  to  the\ncouch  where  Baba  lay  under  a  wool\nblanket.  He  watched  me  joking  with\nSharif,  watched  Soraya  and  me\nlacing  our  fingers  together,  watched\nme  push  back  a  loose  curl  of  her\nhair. I could see his internal smile, as\nwide  as  the  skies  of  Kabul  on  nights\nwhen  the  poplars  shivered  and  the\nsound  of  crickets  swelled  in  the\ngardens.<br><br>   Just  before  midnight,  Baba  asked\nus to help him into bed. Soraya and I\nplaced  his  arms  on  our  shoulders\nand  wrapped  ours  around  his  back.\nWhen  we  lowered  him,  he  had", "Soraya turn off the bedside lamp. He\nasked  us  to  lean  in,  gave  us  each  a\nkiss.<br><br>   \"I'll  come  back  with  your  morphine\nand  a  glass  of  water,  Kaka  jan,\"\nSoraya said.<br><br>   \"Not  tonight,\"  he  said.  \"There  is  no\npain tonight.\" <br><br> \"Okay,\" she said. She pulled up his\nblanket.  We  closed  the  door.  Baba\nnever woke up.<br><br>\nTHEY  FILLED  THE  PARKING\nSPOTS  at  the  mosque  in  Hayward.\nOn the balding grass field behind the\nbuilding,  cars  and  SUVs  parked  in\ncrowded makeshift rows. People had\nto  drive  three  or  four  blocks  north  of\nthe mosque to find a spot.<br><br>   The  men's  section  of  the  mosque\nwas  a  large  square  room,  covered\nwith Afghan rugs and thin mattresses", "placed in parallel lines. Men filed into\nthe  room,  leaving  their  shoes  at  the\nentrance,  and  sat  cross-legged  on\nthe  mattresses.  A  mullah  chanted\nsurrahs  from  the  Koran  into  a\nmicrophone.  I  sat  by  the  door,  the\ncustomary  position  for  the  family  of\nthe  deceased.  General  Taheri  was\nseated next to me.<br><br> Through the open door, I could see\nlines  of  cars  pulling  in,  sunlight\nwinking  in  their  windshields.  They\ndropped  off  passengers,  men\ndressed in dark suits, women clad in\nblack  dresses,  their  heads  covered\nwith traditional white hijabs.<br><br>   As  words  from  the  Koran\nreverberated  through  the  room,  I\nthought  of  the  old  story  of  Baba\nwrestling a black bear in Baluchistan.\nBaba  had  wrestled  bears  his  whole\nlife. Losing his young wife. Raising a\nson  by  himself.  Leaving  his  beloved\nhomeland,  his  watan.  Poverty.\nIndignity.  In  the  end,  a  bear  had", "come that he couldn't best. But even\nthen, he had lost on his own terms.<br><br> After each round of prayers, groups\nof mourners lined up and greeted me\non  their  way  out.  Dutifully,  I  shook\ntheir  hands.  Many  of  them  I  barely\nknew. I smiled politely, thanked them\nfor  their  wishes,  listened  to  whatever\nthey had to say about Baba.<br><br>   ??helped  me  build  the  house  in\nTaimani...\" bless him...<br><br> ??no one else to turn to and he lent\nme...\" <br><br>   \"...found  me  a  job...  barely  knew\nme...\"<br><br> \"...like a brother to me...\"<br><br>   Listening  to  them,  I  realized  how\nmuch  of  who  I  was,  what  I  was,  had\nbeen defined by Baba and the marks\nhe  had  left  on  people's  lives.  My\nwhole  life,  I  had  been  \"Baba's  son.\"\nNow  he  was  gone.  Baba  couldn't", "show  me  the  way  anymore;  I'd  have\nto find it on my own.<br><br> The thought of it terrified me.<br><br> Earlier, at the gravesite in the small\nMuslim section of the cemetery, I had\nwatched  them  lower  Baba  into  the\nhole.  The  mullah  and  another  man\ngot into an argument over which was\nthe correct ayat of the Koran to recite\nat the gravesite. It might have turned\nugly  had  General  Taheri  not\nintervened.  The  mullah  chose  an\nayat  and  recited  it,  casting  the  other\nfellow nasty glances. I watched them\ntoss  the  first  shovelful  of  dirt  into  the\ngrave.  Then  I  left.  Walked  to  the\nother side of the cemetery. Sat in the\nshade of a red maple.<br><br>   Now  the  last  of  the  mourners  had\npaid  their  respects  and  the  mosque\nwas  empty,  save  for  the  mullah\nunplugging  the  microphone  and\nwrapping  his  Koran  in  green  cloth.\nThe general and I stepped out into a", "late-afternoon  sun.  We  walked  down\nthe  steps,  past  men  smoking  in\nclusters.  I  heard  snippets  of  their\nconversations,  a  soccer  game  in\nUnion  City  next  weekend,  a  new\nAfghan  restaurant  in  Santa  Clara.\nLife moving on already, leaving Baba\nbehind.<br><br>   \"How  are  you,  bachem?\"  General\nTaheri said.<br><br> I gritted my teeth. Bit back the tears\nthat  had  threatened  all  day.  \"I'm\ngoing to find Soraya,\" I said.<br><br> \"Okay.\"<br><br> I walked to the women's side of the\nmosque. Soraya was standing on the\nsteps  with  her  mother  and  a  couple\nof  ladies  I  recognized  vaguely  from\nthe \nwedding.  I  motioned  to  Soraya.  She\nsaid  something  to  her  mother  and\ncame to me. ", "  \"Can we walk?\" I said.<br><br> \"Sure.\" She took my hand.<br><br>   We  walked  in  silence  down  a\nwinding gravel path lined by a row of\nlow  hedges.  We  sat  on  a  bench  and\nwatched  an  elderly  couple  kneeling\nbeside a grave a few rows away and\nplacing  a  bouquet  of  daisies  by  the\nheadstone. \"Soraya?\"<br><br> \"Yes?\"<br><br> \"I'm going to miss him.\"<br><br> She put her hand on my lap. Baba's\nchila  glinted  on  her  ring  finger.\nBehind  her,  I  could  see  Baba's\nmourners  driving  away  on  Mission\nBoulevard. Soon we'd leave too, and\nfor the first time ever, Baba would be\nall alone.<br><br>   Soraya  pulled  me  to  her  and  the\ntears finally came. ", " \nBECAUSE  SORAYA  AND  I  never\nhad  an  engagement  period,  much  of\nwhat  I  learned  about  the  Taheris  I\nlearned  after  I  married  into  their\nfamily.  For  example,  I  learned  that,\nonce  a  month,  the  general  suffered\nfrom  blinding  migraines  that  lasted\nalmost a week. When the headaches\nstruck, the general went to his room,\nundressed,  turned  off  the  light,\nlocked  the  door,  and  didn't  come  out\nuntil  the  pain  subsided.  No  one  was\nallowed to go in, no one was allowed\nto  knock.  Eventually,  he  would\nemerge, dressed in his gray suit once\nmore,  smelling  of  sleep  and  bed\nsheets, his eyes puffy and bloodshot.\nI  learned  from  Soraya  that  he  and\nKhanum Taheri had slept in separate\nrooms  for  as  long  as  she  could\nremember. I learned that he could be\npetty,  such  as  when  he'd  take  a  bite\nof  the  qurma  his  wife  placed  before\nhim, sigh, and push it away. \"I'll make\nyou something else,\" Khanum Taheri", "would  say,  but  he'd  ignore  her,  sulk,\nand  eat  bread  and  onion.  This  made\nSoraya  angry  and  her  mother  cry.\nSoraya told me he \ntook  antidepressants.  I  learned  that\nhe had kept his family on welfare and\nhad  never  held  a  job  in  the  U.S.,\npreferring to cash government-issued\nchecks  than  degrading  himself  with\nwork  unsuitable  for  a  man  of  his\nstature--he  saw  the  flea  market  only\nas  a  hobby,  a  way  to  socialize  with\nhis  fellow  Afghans.  The  general\nbelieved  that,  sooner  or  later,\nAfghanistan  would  be  freed,  the\nmonarchy  restored,  and  his  services\nwould once again be called upon. So\nevery  day,  he  donned  his  gray  suit,\nwound his pocket watch, and waited.<br><br>   I  learned  that  Khanum\nTaheri--whom  I  called  Khala  Jamila\nnow--had once been famous in Kabul\nfor  her  enchanting  singing  voice.\nThough  she  had  never  sung\nprofessionally, she had had the talent\nto--I  learned  she  could  sing  folk", "songs,  ghazals,  even  raga,  which\nwas  usually  a  man's  domain.  But  as\nmuch  as  the  general  appreciated\nlistening  to  music--he  owned,  in  fact,\na  considerable  collection  of  classical\nghazal  tapes  by  Afghan  and  Hindi\nsingers--he  believed  the  performing\nof  it  best  left  to  those  with  lesser\nreputations.  That  she  never  sing  in\npublic  had  been  one  of  the  general's\nconditions  when  they  had  married.\nSoraya  told  me  that  her  mother  had\nwanted  to  sing  at  our  wedding,  only\none  song,  but  the  general  gave  her\none  of  his  looks  and  the  matter  was\nburied.  Khala  Jamila  played  the  lotto\nonce  a  week  and  watched  Johnny\nCarson  every  night.  She  spent  her\ndays  in  the  garden,  tending  to  her\nroses,  geraniums,  potato  vines,  and\norchids.<br><br> When I married Soraya, the flowers\nand Johnny Carson took a backseat.\nI  was  the  new  delight  in  Khala\nJamila's  life.  Unlike  the  general's\nguarded  and  diplomatic  manners--he", "didn't correct me when I continued to\ncall  him  \"General  Sahib\"--Khala\nJamila  made  no  secret  of  how  much\nshe  adored  me.  For  one  thing,  I\nlistened  to  her  impressive  list  of\nmaladies, something the general had\nlong turned a deaf ear to. Soraya told\nme  that,  ever  since  her  mother's\nstroke,  every  flutter  in  her  chest  was\na  heart  attack,  every  aching  joint  the\nonset  of  rheumatoid  arthritis,  and\nevery  twitch  of  the  eye  another\nstroke.  I  remember  the  first  time\nKhala  Jamila  mentioned  a  lump  in\nher  neck  to  me.  \"I'll  skip  school\ntomorrow and take you to the doctor,\"\nI  said,  to  which  the  general  smiled\nand  said,  \"Then  you  might  as  well\nturn in your books for good, bachem.\nYour  khala's  medical  charts  are  like\nthe  works  of  Rumi:  They  come  in\nvolumes.\"<br><br> But it wasn't just that she'd found an\naudience  for  her  monologues  of\nillness.  I  firmly  believed  that  if  I  had\npicked  up  a  rifle  and  gone  on  a", "murdering rampage, I would have still\nhad the benefit of her unblinking love.\nBecause  I  had  rid  her  heart  of  its\ngravest malady. I had relieved her of\nthe  greatest  fear  of  every  Afghan\nmother:  that  no  honorable  khastegar\nwould  ask  for  her  daughter's  hand.\nThat  her  daughter  would  age  alone,\nhusbandless, childless. Every woman\nneeded  a  husband.  Even  if  he  did\nsilence the song in her. <br><br>   And,  from  Soraya,  I  learned  the\ndetails  of  what  had  happened  in\nVirginia.<br><br>   We  were  at  a  wedding.  Soraya's\nuncle, Sharif, the one who worked for\nthe  INS,  was  marrying  his  son  to  an\nAfghan  girl  from  Newark.  The\nwedding was at the same hall where,\nsix  months  prior,  Soraya  and  I  had\nhad  our  awroussi.  We  were  standing\nin  a  crowd  of  guests,  watching  the\nbride  accept  rings  from  the  groom's\nfamily,  when  we  overheard  two\nmiddle-aged  women  talking,  their\nbacks to us. ", "    \"What  a  lovely  bride,\"  one  of  them\nsaid, \"Just look at her. So maghbool,\nlike the moon.\"<br><br> \"Yes,\" the other said. \"And pure too.\nVirtuous. No boyfriends.\"<br><br>   \"I  know.  I  tell  you  that  boy  did  well\nnot to marry his cousin.\"<br><br>   Soraya  broke  down  on  the  way\nhome.  I  pulled  the  Ford  off  to  the\ncurb,  parked  under  a  streetlight  on\nFremont Boulevard.<br><br>   \"It's  all  right,\"  I  said,  pushing  back\nher hair. \"Who cares?\"<br><br> \"It's so fucking unfair,\" she barked.<br><br> \"Just forget it.\"<br><br>   \"Their  sons  go  out  to  nightclubs\nlooking  for  meat  and  get  their\ngirlfriends  pregnant,  they  have  kids\nout  of  wedlock  and  no  one  says  a", "goddamn  thing.  Oh,  they're  just  men\nhaving  fun!  I  make  one  mistake  and\nsuddenly  everyone  is  talking  nang\nand  namoos,  and  I  have  to  have  my\nface  rubbed  in  it  for  the  rest  of  my\nlife.\"<br><br> I wiped a tear from her jawline, just\nabove  her  birthmark,  with  the  pad  of\nmy thumb. <br><br>   \"I  didn't  tell  you,\"  Soraya  said,\ndabbing  at  her  eyes,  \"but  my  father\nshowed  up  with  a  gun  that  night.  He\ntold... him... that he had two bullets in\nthe chamber, one for him and one for\nhimself  if  I  didn't  come  home.  I  was\nscreaming, calling my father all kinds\nof  names,  saying  he  couldn't  keep\nme  locked  up  forever,  that  I  wished\nhe were dead.\" Fresh tears squeezed\nout  between  her  lids.  \"I  actually  said\nthat  to  him,  that  I  wished  he  were\ndead.<br><br>   \"When  he  brought  me  home,  my\nmother  threw  her  arms  around  me\nand  she  was  crying  too.  She  was", "saying  things  but  I  couldn't\nunderstand  any  of  it  because  she\nwas  slurring  her  words  so  badly.  So\nmy father took me up to my bedroom\nand  sat  me  in  front  of  the  dresser\nmirror.  He  handed  me  a  pair  of\nscissors and calmly told me to cut off\nall my hair. He watched while I did it.<br><br>   \"I  didn't  step  out  of  the  house  for\nweeks.  And  when  I  did,  I  heard\nwhispers  or  imagined  them\neverywhere  I  went.  That  was  four\nyears  ago  and  three  thousand  miles\naway and I'm still hearing them.\"<br><br> \"Fuck 'em,\" I said.<br><br>   She  made  a  sound  that  was  half\nsob,  half  laugh.  \"When  I  told  you\nabout  this  on  the  phone  the  night  of\nkhastegari,  I  was  sure  you'd  change\nyour mind.\"<br><br> \"No chance of that, Soraya.\"<br><br> She smiled and took my hand. \"I'm", "so lucky to have found you. You're so\ndifferent  from  every  Afghan  guy  I've\nmet.\"<br><br>   \"Let's  never  talk  about  this  again,\nokay?\"<br><br> \"Okay.\"<br><br> I kissed her cheek and pulled away\nfrom the curb. As I drove, I wondered\nwhy  I  was  different.  Maybe  it  was\nbecause I had been raised by men; I\nhadn't  grown  up  around  women  and\nhad never been exposed firsthand to\nthe  double  standard  with  which\nAfghan  society  sometimes  treated\nthem.  Maybe  it  was  because  Baba\nhad  been  such  an  unusual  Afghan\nfather, a liberal who had lived by \nhis  own  rules,  a  maverick  who  had\ndisregarded  or  embraced  societal\ncustoms as he had seen fit.<br><br> But I think a big part of the reason I\ndidn't  care  about  Soraya's  past  was\nthat  I  had  one  of  my  own.  I  knew  all", "about regret.<br><br>\nSHORTLY  AFTER  BABA'S  DEATH,\nSoraya  and  I  moved  into  a\none-bedroom  apartment  in  Fremont,\njust  a  few  blocks  away  from  the\ngeneral and Khala Jamila's house.<br><br> Soraya's parents bought us a brown\nleather  couch  and  a  set  of  Mikasa\ndishes  as  housewarming  presents.\nThe  general  gave  me  an  additional\npresent, a brand new IBM typewriter.\nIn  the  box,  he  had  slipped  a  note\nwritten  in  Farsi:  Amir  jan,  I  hope  you\ndiscover many tales on these keys.<br><br> General Iqbal Taheri<br><br>\nI  sold  Baba's  VW  bus  and,  to  this\nday, I have not gone back to the flea\nmarket.

We shared toothbrushes\nand  socks,  passed  each  other  the\nmorning paper. She slept on the right\nside  of  the  bed,  I  preferred  the  left.\nShe  liked  fluffy  pillows,  I  liked  the\nhard  ones.  She  ate  her  cereal  dry,\nlike a snack, and chased it with milk.<br><br>   I  got  my  acceptance  at  San  Jose\nState  that  summer  and  declared  an\nEnglish  major.  I  took  on  a  security\njob,  swing  shift  at  a  furniture\nwarehouse  in  Sunnyvale.  The  job\nwas  dreadfully  boring,  but  its  saving\ngrace was a considerable one: When\neveryone left at 6 P.M. and shadows\nbegan  to  crawl  between  aisles  of\nplastic-covered  sofas  piled  to  the\nceiling, I took out my books \nand  studied.  It  was  in  the\nPine-Sol-scented  office  of  that", "furniture  warehouse  that  I  began  my\nfirst novel.<br><br> Soraya joined me at San Jose State\nthe  following  year  and  enrolled,  to\nher  father's  chagrin,  in  the  teaching\ntrack.<br><br>   \"I  don't  know  why  you're  wasting\nyour  talents  like  this,\"  the  general\nsaid  one  night  over  dinner.  \"Did  you\nknow,  Amir  jan,  that  she  earned\nnothing  but  A's  in  high  school?\"  He\nturned  to  her.  \"An  intelligent  girl  like\nyou  could  become  a  lawyer,  a\npolitical  scientist.  And,  Inshallah,\nwhen  Afghanistan  is  free,  you  could\nhelp write the new constitution. There\nwould  be  a  need  for  young  talented\nAfghans  like  you.  They  might  even\noffer  you  a  ministry  position,  given\nyour family name.\"<br><br>   I  could  see  Soraya  holding  back,\nher  face  tightening.  \"I'm  not  a  girl,\nPadar.

Besides,\nthey'd need teachers too.\"<br><br> \"Anyone can teach.\"<br><br>   \"Is  there  any  more  rice,  Madar?\"\nSoraya said.<br><br> After the general excused himself to\nmeet some friends in Hayward, Khala\nJamila  tried  to  console  Soraya.  \"He\nmeans well,\" she said. \"He just wants\nyou to be successful.\"<br><br> \"So he can boast about his attorney\ndaughter  to  his  friends.  Another\nmedal for the general,\" Soraya said.<br><br> \"Such nonsense you speak!\"<br><br>   \"Successful,\"  Soraya  hissed.  \"At\nleast  I'm  not  like  him,  sitting  around\nwhile  other  people  fight  the  Shorawi,\nwaiting  for  when  the  dust  settles  so\nhe can move in and reclaim his posh\nlittle  government  position.  Teaching\nmay not pay much, ", "but  it's  what  I  want  to  do!  It's  what  I\nlove,  and  it's  a  whole  lot  better  than\ncollecting welfare, by the way.\"<br><br>   Khala  Jamila  bit  her  tongue.  \"If  he\never  hears  you  saying  that,  he  will\nnever speak to you again.\"<br><br>   \"Don't  worry,\"  Soraya  snapped,\ntossing  her  napkin  on  the  plate.  \"I\nwon't bruise his precious ego.\"<br><br>\nIN THE SUMMER of 1988, about six\nmonths  before  the  Soviets  withdrew\nfrom  Afghanistan,  I  finished  my  first\nnovel, a father-son story set in Kabul,\nwritten  mostly  with  the  typewriter  the\ngeneral  had  given  me.  I  sent  query\nletters  to  a  dozen  agencies  and  was\nstunned  one  August  day  when  I\nopened  our  mailbox  and  found  a\nrequest  from  a  New  York  agency  for\nthe completed manuscript. I mailed it\nthe  next  day.  Soraya  kissed  the\ncarefully  wrapped  manuscript  and", "Khala  Jamila  insisted  we  pass  it\nunder  the  Koran.  She  told  me  that\nshe  was  going  to  do  nazr  for  me,  a\nvow to have a sheep slaughtered and\nthe meat given to the poor if my book\nwas accepted.<br><br> \"Please, no nazn, Khala jan,\" I said,\nkissing her face. \"Just do zakat, give\nthe  money  to  someone  in  need,\nokay? No sheep killing.\"<br><br>   Six  weeks  later,  a  man  named\nMartin  Greenwalt  called  from  New\nYork  and  offered  to  represent  me.  I\nonly  told  Soraya  about  it.  \"But  just\nbecause  I  have  an  agent  doesn't\nmean I'll get published. If Martin sells\nthe novel, then we'll celebrate.\"<br><br>   A  month  later,  Martin  called  and\ninformed  me  I  was  going  to  be  a\npublished  novelist.  When  I  told\nSoraya, she screamed.<br><br>   We  had  a  celebration  dinner  with\nSoraya's  parents  that  night.  Khala", "Jamila  made  kofta--meatballs  and\nwhite  rice--and  white  ferni.  The\ngeneral,  a  sheen  of  moisture  in  his\neyes,  said  that  he  was  proud  of  me.\nAfter General Taheri and his wife left,\nSoraya  and  I  celebrated  with  an\nexpensive  bottle  of  Merlot  I  had\nbought on the way home--the general\ndid  not  approve  of  women  drinking\nalcohol, and Soraya didn't drink in his\npresence.<br><br>     \"I  am  so  proud  of  you,\"  she  said,\nraising  her  glass  to  mine.  \"Kaka\nwould have been proud too.\"<br><br>   \"I  know,\"  I  said,  thinking  of  Baba,\nwishing he could have seen me.<br><br>   Later  that  night,  after  Soraya  fell\nasleep--wine  always  made  her\nsleepy--I  stood  on  the  balcony  and\nbreathed  in  the  cool  summer  air.  I\nthought  of  Rahim  Khan  and  the  little\nnote  of  support  he  had  written  me\nafter  he'd  read  my  first  story.  And  I\nthought  of  Hassan.  Some  day,\nInshallah,  you  will  be  a  great  writer,", "he had said once, and people all over\nthe world will read your stories. There\nwas so much goodness in my life. So\nmuch happiness. I wondered whether\nI deserved any of it.<br><br>   The  novel  was  released  in  the\nsummer  of  that  following  year,  1989,\nand  the  publisher  sent  me  on  a\nfive-city book tour. I became a minor\ncelebrity  in  the  Afghan  community.\nThat  was  the  year  that  the  Shorawi\ncompleted  their  withdrawal  from\nAfghanistan.  It  should  have  been  a\ntime of glory for Afghans. Instead, the\nwar  raged  on,  this  time  between\nAfghans,  the  Mujahedin,  against  the\nSoviet  puppet  government  of\nNajibullah, and Afghan refugees kept\nflocking  to  Pakistan.  That  was  the\nyear  that  the  cold  war  ended,  the\nyear  the  Berlin  Wall  came  down.  It\nwas  the  year  of  Tiananmen  Square.\nIn the midst of it all, Afghanistan was\nforgotten.  And  General  Taheri,\nwhose hopes had stirred awake after\nthe  Soviets  pulled  out,  went  back  to", "winding his pocket watch.<br><br> That was also the year that Soraya\nand I began trying to have a child.<br><br>\nTHE  IDEA  OF  FATHERHOOD\nunleashed a swirl of emotions in me.\nI  found  it  frightening,  invigorating,\ndaunting,  and  exhilarating  all  at  the\nsame time. What sort of father would\nI  make,  I  wondered.  I  wanted  to  be\njust  like  Baba  and  I  wanted  to  be\nnothing like him.<br><br>   But  a  year  passed  and  nothing\nhappened.  With  each  cycle  of  blood,\nSoraya  grew  more  frustrated,  more\nimpatient,  more  irritable.  By  then,\nKhala  Jamila's  initially  subtle  hints\nhad become overt, as in \"Kho dega!\"\nSo! \"When am I going to sing alahoo\nfor  my  little  nawasa?\"  The  general,\never the Pashtun, never made any \nqueries--doing so meant alluding to a\nsexual act between his daughter and", "a  man,  even  if  the  man  in  question\nhad been married to her for over four\nyears.  But  his  eyes  perked  up  when\nKhala  Jamila  teased  us  about  a\nbaby.<br><br> \"Sometimes, it takes a while,\" I told\nSoraya one night.<br><br>   \"A  year  isn't  a  while,  Amir!\"  she\nsaid, in a terse voice so unlike her.<br><br> \"Something's wrong, I know it.\"<br><br> \"Then let's see a doctor.\"<br><br>\nDR.  ROSEN,  a  round-bellied  man\nwith  a  plump  face  and  small,  even\nteeth,  spoke  with  a  faint  Eastern\nEuropean  accent,  some  thing\nremotely Slavic. He had a passion for\ntrains--his  office  was  littered  with\nbooks  about  the  history  of  railroads,\nmodel  locomotives,  paintings  of\ntrains  trundling  on  tracks  through", "green  hills  and  over  bridges.

He\nfound  nothing.  \"The  plumbing's\nclear,\"  he  announced,  snapping  off\nhis  latex  gloves.  I  wished  he'd  stop\ncalling  it  that--we  weren't  bathrooms.\nWhen  the  tests  were  over,  he\nexplained  that  he  couldn't  explain\nwhy  we  couldn't  have  kids.  And,\napparently, that wasn't so unusual. It\nwas called \"Unexplained Infertility.\"<br><br>   Then  came  the  treatment  phase.\nWe  tried  a  drug  called  Clomiphene,\nand  hMG,  a  series  of  shots  which", "Soraya  gave  to  herself.

We're\na  melancholic  people,  we  Afghans,\naren't  we?  Often,  we  wallow  too\nmuch  in  ghamkhori  and  self-pity.  We", "give  in  to  loss,  to  suffering,  accept  it\nas  a  fact  of  life,  even  see  it  as\nnecessary. Zendagi migzara, we say,\nlife  goes  on.  But  I  am  not\nsurrendering to fate here, I am being\npragmatic.  I  have  seen  several  good\ndoctors here and they have given the\nsame  answer.  I  trust  them  and\nbelieve  them.  There  is  such  a  thing\nas God's will.\"<br><br> \"There is only what you do and what\nyou don't do,\" I said.<br><br>   Rahim  Khan  laughed.  \"You\nsounded  like  your  father  just  now.  I\nmiss him so much. But it is God's will,\nAmir  jan.  It  really  is.\"  He  paused.\n\"Besides,  there's  another  reason  I\nasked you to come here. I wanted to\nsee  you  before  I  go,  yes,  but\nsomething else too.\"<br><br> \"Anything.\"<br><br> \"You know all those years I lived in\nyour father's house after you left?\" ", "  \"Yes.\" <br><br>   \"I  wasn't  alone  for  all  of  them.\nHassan lived there with me.\"<br><br> \"Hassan,\" I said. When was the last\ntime  I  had  spoken  his  name?  Those\nthorny old barbs of guilt bore into me\nonce  more,  as  if  speaking  his  name\nhad  broken  a  spell,  set  them  free  to\ntorment me anew. Suddenly the air in\nRahim Khan's little flat was too thick,\ntoo hot, too rich with the smell of the\nstreet.<br><br>   \"I  thought  about  writing  you  and\ntelling  you  before,  but  I  wasn't  sure\nyou wanted to know. Was I wrong?\"<br><br> The truth was no. The lie was yes. I\nsettled  for  something  in  between.  \"I\ndon't know.\"<br><br> He coughed another patch of blood\ninto  the  handkerchief.  When  he  bent\nhis head to spit, I saw honey-crusted\nsores  on  his  scalp.  \"I  brought  you", "here  because  I  am  going  to  ask\nsomething  of  you.

Do you understand?\"<br><br> \"Yes,\" I murmured.<br><br> \"I want to tell you about him. I want\nto  tell  you  everything.  You  will\nlisten?\"<br><br> I nodded.<br><br>   Then  Rahim  Khan  sipped  some\nmore  tea.  Rested  his  head  against\nthe wall and spoke.", "#$#$Chapter 16#$#$\n<br><br> There  were  a  lot  of  reasons  why  I\nwent  to  Hazarajat  to  find  Hassan  in\n1986.  The  biggest  one,  Allah  forgive\nme,  was  that  I  was  lonely.  By  then,\nmost  of  my  friends  and  relatives  had\neither been killed or had escaped the\ncountry  to  Pakistan  or  Iran.  I  barely\nknew  anyone  in  Kabul  anymore,  the\ncity  where  I  had  lived  my  entire  life.\nEverybody  had  fled.  I  would  take  a\nwalk  in  the  Karteh  Parwan\nsection--where  the  melon  vendors\nused to hang out in the old days, you\nremember  that  spot?--and  I  wouldn't\nrecognize  anyone  there.  No  one  to\ngreet,  no  one  to  sit  down  with  for\nchai,  no  one  to  share  stories  with,\njust  Roussi  soldiers  patrolling  the\nstreets.  So  eventually,  I  stopped\ngoing out to the city.<br><br>   I  would  spend  my  days  in  your\nfather's  house,  up  in  the  study,\nreading  your  mother's  old  books,", "listening  to  the  news,  watching  the\ncommunist propaganda on television.\nThen  I  would  pray  natnaz,  cook\nsomething,  eat,  read  some  more,\npray  again,  and  go  to  bed.  I  would\nrise  in  the  morning,  pray,  do  it  all\nover again.<br><br> And with my arthritis, it was getting\nharder for me to maintain the house.\nMy  knees  and  back  were  always\naching--I would get up in the morning\nand it would take me at least an hour\nto shake the stiffness from my joints,\nespecially  in  the  wintertime.  I  did  not\nwant  to  let  your  father's  house  go  to\nrot; we had all had many good times\nin  that  house,  so  many  memories,\nAmir jan. It was not right--your father\nhad  designed  that  house  himself;  it\nhad  meant  so  much  to  him,  and\nbesides,  I  had  promised  him  I  would\ncare  for  it  when  he  and  you  left  for\nPakistan. Now it was just me and the\nhouse  and...  I  did  my  best.  I  tried  to\nwater  the  trees  every  few  days,  cut\nthe  lawn,  tend  to  the  flowers,  fix", "things  that  needed  fixing,  but,  even\nthen,  I  was  not  a  young  man\nanymore.<br><br> But even so, I might have been able\nto  manage.  At  least  for  a  while\nlonger.  But  when  news  of  your\nfather's  death  reached  me...  for  the\nfirst time, I felt a terrible loneliness in\nthat  house.  An  unbearable\nemptiness.<br><br>   So  one  day,  I  fueled  up  the  Buick\nand  drove  up  to  Hazarajat.  I\nremembered that, after Ali dismissed\nhimself  from  the  house,  your  father\ntold me he and Hassan had moved to\na  small  village  just  outside  Bamiyan.\nAli had a cousin there as I recalled. I\nhad  no  idea  if  Hassan  would  still  be\nthere,  if  anyone  would  even  know  of\nhim  or  his  whereabouts.  After  all,  it\nhad  been  ten  years  since  Ali  and\nHassan  had  left  your  father's  house.\nHassan  would  have  been  a  grown\nman  in  1986,  twenty-two,\ntwenty-three  years  old.  If  he  was", "even alive, that is--the \nShorawi, may they rot in hell for what\nthey did to our watan, killed so many\nof our young men. I don't have to tell\nyou that.<br><br>   But,  with  the  grace  of  God,  I  found\nhim  there.  It  took  very  little\nsearching--all  I  had  to  do  was  ask  a\nfew questions in Bamiyan and people\npointed  me  to  his  village.  I  do  not\neven  recall  its  name,  or  whether  it\neven had one. But I remember it was\na  scorching  summer  day  and  I  was\ndriving  up  a  rutted  dirt  road,  nothing\non  either  side  but  sunbaked  bushes,\ngnarled,  spiny  tree  trunks,  and  dried\ngrass  like  pale  straw.  I  passed  a\ndead  donkey  rotting  on  the  side  of\nthe  road.  And  then  I  turned  a  corner\nand, right in the middle of that barren\nland,  I  saw  a  cluster  of  mud  houses,\nbeyond  them  nothing  but  broad  sky\nand mountains like jagged teeth.<br><br> The people in Bamiyan had told me\nI would find him easily--he lived in the", "only  house  in  the  village  that  had  a\nwalled  garden.  The  mud  wall,  short\nand  pocked  with  holes,  enclosed  the\ntiny  house--which  was  really  not\nmuch  more  than  a  glorified  hut.\nBarefoot children were playing on the\nstreet,  kicking  a  ragged  tennis  ball\nwith  a  stick,  and  they  stared  when  I\npulled  up  and  killed  the  engine.  I\nknocked  on  the  wooden  door  and\nstepped  through  into  a  yard  that  had\nvery  little  in  it  save  for  a  parched\nstrawberry  patch  and  a  bare  lemon\ntree.  There  was  a  tandoor  in  the\ncorner  in  the  shadow  of  an  acacia\ntree  and  I  saw  a  man  squatting\nbeside it. He was placing dough on a\nlarge wooden spatula and slapping it\nagainst  the  walls  of  the  tandoor.  He\ndropped the dough when he saw me.\nI  had  to  make  him  stop  kissing  my\nhands.<br><br>   \"Let  me  look  at  you,\"  I  said.  He\nstepped  away.  He  was  so  tall  now--I\nstood  on  my  toes  and  still  just  came\nup to his chin. The Bamiyan sun had", "toughened  his  skin,  and  turned  it\nseveral  shades  darker  than  I\nremembered,  and  he  had  lost  a  few\nof  his  front  teeth.  There  were  sparse\nstrands  of  hair  on  his  chin.  Other\nthan that, he had those same narrow\ngreen  eyes,  that  scar  on  his  upper\nlip, that round face, that affable smile.\nYou  would  have  recognized  him,\nAmir jan. I am sure of it.<br><br> We went inside. There was a young\nlight-skinned  Hazara  woman,  sewing\na shawl in a corner of the room. She\nwas  visibly  expecting.  \"This  is  my\nwife,  Rahim  Khan,\"  Hassan  said\nproudly.  \"Her  name  is  Farzana  jan.\"\nShe was a shy woman, so courteous\nshe  spoke  in  a  voice  barely  higher\nthan  a  whisper  and  she  would  not\nraise  her  pretty  hazel  eyes  to  meet\nmy  gaze.  But  the  way  she  was\nlooking  at  Hassan,  he  might  as  well\nhave been sitting on the throne at the\nArg.<br><br>   \"When  is  the  baby  coming?\"  I  said", "after we all settled around the adobe\nroom. There was nothing in the room,\njust a frayed rug, a few dishes, a pair\nof mattresses, and a lantern.<br><br>     \"Inshallah,  this  winter,\"  Hassan\nsaid. \"I am praying for a boy to carry\non my father's name.\"<br><br> \"Speaking of Ali, where is he?\"<br><br>   Hassan  dropped  his  gaze.  He  told\nme  that  Ali  and  his  cousin--who  had\nowned the house--had been killed by\na  land  mine  two  years  before,  just\noutside  of  Bamiyan.  A  land  mine.  Is\nthere  a  more  Afghan  way  of  dying,\nAmir  jan?  And  for  some  crazy\nreason,  I  became  absolutely  certain\nthat  it  had  been  Ali's  right  leg--his\ntwisted  polio  leg--that  had  finally\nbetrayed  him  and  stepped  on  that\nland mine. I was deeply saddened to\nhear  Ali  had  died.  Your  father  and  I\ngrew  up  together,  as  you  know,  and\nAli  had  been  with  him  as  long  as  I\ncould  remember.  I  remember  when\nwe  were  all  little,  the  year  Ali  got", "polio  and  almost  died.  Your  father\nwould walk around the house all day\ncrying.<br><br>   Farzana  made  us  shorwa  with\nbeans,  turnips,  and  potatoes.  We\nwashed  our  hands  and  dipped  fresh\nnaan  from  the  tandoor  into  the\nshorwa--it  was  the  best  meal  I  had\nhad  in  months.  It  was  then  that  I\nasked Hassan to move to Kabul with\nme. I told him about the house, how I\ncould  not  care  for  it  by  myself\nanymore.  I  told  him  I  would  pay  him\nwell,  that  he  and  his  khanum  would\nbe  comfortable.  They  looked  to  each\nother and did not say anything. Later,\nafter  we  had  washed  our  hands  and\nFarzana  had  served  us  grapes,\nHassan  said  the  village  was  his\nhome  now;  he  and  Farzana  had\nmade a life for themselves there.<br><br> \"And Bamiyan is so close. We know\npeople  there.  Forgive  me,  Rahim\nKhan. I pray you understand.\" ", "    \"Of  course,\"  I  said.  \"You  have\nnothing  to  apologize  for.  I\nunderstand.\"<br><br>   It  was  midway  through  tea  after\nshorwa  that  Hassan  asked  about\nyou.  I  told  him  you  were  in  America,\nbut  that  I  did  not  know  much  more.\nHassan  had  so  many  questions\nabout you. Had you married? Did you\nhave  children?  How  tall  were  you?\nDid  you  still  fly  kites  and  go  to  the\ncinema?  Were  you  happy?  He  said\nhe  had  befriended  an  old  Farsi\nteacher  in  Bamiyan  who  had  taught\nhim to read and write. If he wrote you\na  letter,  would  I  pass  it  on  to  you?\nAnd did I think you would write back?\nI told him what I knew of you from the\nfew  phone  conversations  I  had  had\nwith  your  father,  but  mostly  I  did  not\nknow  how  to  answer  him.  Then  he\nasked  me  about  your  father.  When  I\ntold him, Hassan \nburied  his  face  in  his  hands  and\nbroke into tears. He wept like a child\nfor the rest of that night. ", "  They insisted that I spend the night\nthere. Farzana fixed a cot for me and\nleft me a glass of well water in case I\ngot  thirsty.  All  night,  I  heard  her\nwhispering to Hassan, and heard him\nsobbing.<br><br>   In  the  morning,  Hassan  told  me  he\nand Farzana had decided to move to\nKabul with me.<br><br>   \"I  should  not  have  come  here,\"  I\nsaid.  \"You  were  right,  Hassan  jan.\nYou  have  a  zendagi,  a  life  here.  It\nwas  presumptuous  of  me  to  just\nshow  up  and  ask  you  to  drop\neverything. It is me who needs to be\nforgiven.\"<br><br>   \"We  don't  have  that  much  to  drop,\nRahim Khan,\" Hassan said. His eyes\nwere still red and puffy. \"We'll go with\nyou.  We'll  help  you  take  care  of  the\nhouse.\"<br><br> \"Are you absolutely sure?\" ", "    He  nodded  and  dropped  his  head.\n\"Agha  sahib  was  like  my  second\nfather... God give him peace.\"<br><br> They piled their things in the center\nof  a  few  worn  rags  and  tied  the\ncorners  together.  We  loaded  the\nbundle  into  the  Buick.  Hassan  stood\nin  the  threshold  of  the  house  and\nheld the Koran as we all kissed it and\npassed  under  it.  Then  we  left  for\nKabul.  I  remember  as  I  was  pulling\naway,  Hassan  turned  to  take  a  last\nlook at their home.<br><br> When we got to Kabul, I discovered\nthat  Hassan  had  no  intention  of\nmoving into the house. \"But all these\nrooms  are  empty,  Hassan  jan.  No\none is going to live in them,\" I said.<br><br>   But  he  would  not.  He  said  it  was  a\nmatter of ihtiram, a matter of respect.\nHe  and  Farzana  moved  their  things\ninto  the  hut  in  the  backyard,  where\nhe  was  born.  I  pleaded  for  them  to", "move into one of the guest bedrooms\nupstairs, but \nHassan  would  hear  nothing  of  it.\n\"What  will  Amir  agha  think?\"  he  said\nto  me.  \"What  will  he  think  when  he\ncomes  back  to  Kabul  after  the  war\nand  finds  that  I  have  assumed  his\nplace  in  the  house?\"  Then,  in\nmourning  for  your  father,  Hassan\nwore black for the next forty days.<br><br>   I  did  not  want  them  to,  but  the  two\nof  them  did  all  the  cooking,  all  the\ncleaning.  Hassan  tended  to  the\nflowers  in  the  garden,  soaked  the\nroots,  picked  off  yellowing  leaves,\nand  planted  rosebushes.  He  painted\nthe  walls.  In  the  house,  he  swept\nrooms  no  one  had  slept  in  for  years,\nand  cleaned  bathrooms  no  one  had\nbathed in. Like he was preparing the\nhouse  for  someone's  return.  Do  you\nremember the wall behind the row of\ncorn  your  father  had  planted,  Amir\njan? What did you and Hassan call it,\n\"the  Wall  of  Ailing  Corn\"?  A  rocket\ndestroyed a whole section of that wall", "in  the  middle  of  the  night  early  that\nfall.  Hassan  rebuilt  the  wall  with  his\nown  hands,  brick  by  brick,  until  it\nstood'  whole  again.  I  do  not  know\nwhat I would have done if he had not\nbeen  there.  Then  late  that  fall,\nFarzana gave birth to a stillborn baby\ngirl. Hassan kissed the baby's lifeless\nface,  and  we  buried  her  in  the\nbackyard,  near  the  sweetbrier\nbushes.  We  covered  the  little  mound\nwith  leaves  from  the  poplar  trees.  I\nsaid a prayer for her. Farzana stayed\nin  the  hut  all  day  and  wailed--it  is  a\nheartbreaking  sound,  Amir  jan,  the\nwailing  of  a  mother.  I  pray  to  Allah\nyou never hear it.<br><br>   Outside  the  walls  of  that  house,\nthere was a war raging. But the three\nof  us,  in  your  father's  house,  we\nmade our own little haven from it. My\nvision  started  going  by  the  late\n1980s,  so  I  had  Hassan  read  me\nyour mother's books. We would sit in\nthe  foyer,  by  the  stove,  and  Hassan\nwould  read  me  from  Masnawi  or", "Khayyam,  as  Farzana  cooked  in  the\nkitchen.  And  every  morning,  Hassan\nplaced a flower on the little mound by\nthe sweetbrier bushes.<br><br>   In  early  1990,  Farzana  became\npregnant  again.  It  was  that  same\nyear,  in  the  middle  of  the  summer,\nthat  a  woman  covered  in  a  sky  blue\nburqa knocked on the front gates one\nmorning.  When  I  walked  up  to  the\ngates,  she  was  swaying  on  her  feet,\nlike she was too weak to even stand.\nI asked her what she wanted, but she\nwould not answer.<br><br> \"Who are you?\" I said. But she just\ncollapsed right there in the driveway.\nI yelled for Hassan and he helped me\ncarry her into the house, to the living\nroom.  We  lay  her  on  the  sofa  and\ntook  off  her  burqa.  Beneath  it,  we\nfound a toothless woman with stringy\ngraying  hair  and  sores  on  her  arms.\nShe looked like she had not eaten for\ndays.  But  the  worst  of  it  by  far  was\nher face. Someone had taken a knife", "to  it  and...  Amir  jan,  the  slashes  cut\nthis  way  and  that  way.  One  of  the\ncuts went from cheekbone to hairline\nand it had not spared her left eye on\nthe  way.  It  was  grotesque.  I  patted\nher  brow  with  a  wet  cloth  and  she\nopened  her  eyes.  \"Where  is\nHassan?\" she whispered.<br><br>     \"I'm  right  here,\"  Hassan  said.  He\ntook her hand and squeezed it.<br><br> Her good eye rolled to him. \"I have\nwalked long and far to see if you are\nas beautiful in the flesh as you are in\nmy  dreams.  And  you  are.  Even\nmore.\"  She  pulled  his  hand  to  her\nscarred face. \"Smile for me. Please.\"<br><br>   Hassan  did  and  the  old  woman\nwept. \"You smiled coming out of me,\ndid  anyone  ever  tell  you?  And  I\nwouldn't even hold you. Allah forgive\nme, I wouldn't even hold you.\"<br><br>   None  of  us  had  seen  Sanaubar\nsince  she  had  eloped  with  a  band  of\nsingers  and  dancers  in  1964,  just", "after  she  had  given  birth  to  Hassan.\nYou  never  saw  her,  Amir,  but  in  her\nyouth,  she  was  a  vision.  She  had  a\ndimpled  smile  and  a  walk  that  drove\nmen  crazy.  No  one  who  passed  her\non  the  street,  be  it  a  man  or  a\nwoman,  could  look  at  her  only  once.\nAnd now...<br><br>   Hassan  dropped  her  hand  and\nbolted  out  of  the  house.  I  went  after\nhim,  but  he  was  too  fast.  I  saw  him\nrunning  up  the  hill  where  you  two\nused  to  play,  his  feet  kicking  up\nplumes of dust. I let him go. I sat with\nSanaubar  all  day  as  the  sky  went\nfrom  bright  blue  to  purple.  Hassan\nstill  had  not  come  back  when  night\nfell and moonlight bathed the clouds.\nSanaubar cried that coming back had\nbeen a mistake, maybe even a worse\none  than  leaving.  But  I  made  her\nstay. Hassan would return, I knew.<br><br>   He  came  back  the  next  morning,\nlooking  tired  and  weary,  like  he  had\nnot  slept  all  night.  He  took", "Sanaubar's  hand  in  both  of  his  and\ntold  her  she  could  cry  if  she  wanted\nto  but  she  needn't,  she  was  home\nnow,  he  said,  home  with  her  family.\nHe  touched  the  scars  on  her  face,\nand ran his hand through her hair.<br><br>   Hassan  and  Farzana  nursed  her\nback  to  health.  They  fed  her  and\nwashed  her  clothes.  I  gave  her  one\nof  the  guest  rooms  upstairs.\nSometimes,  I  would  look  out  the\nwindow  into  the  yard  and  watch\nHassan  and  his  mother  kneeling\ntogether,  picking  tomatoes  or\ntrimming  a  rosebush,  talking.  They\nwere  catching  up  on  all  the  lost\nyears,  I  suppose.  As  far  as  I  know,\nhe never asked where she had been\nor  why  she  had  left  and  she  never\ntold.  I  guess  some  stories  do  not\nneed telling. <br><br>   It  was  Sanaubar  who  delivered\nHassan's  son  that  winter  of  1990.  It\nhad  not  started  snowing  yet,  but  the\nwinter  winds  were  blowing  through\nthe  yards,  bending  the  flowerbeds", "and  rustling  the  leaves.  I  remember\nSanaubar  came  out  of  the  hut\nholding  her  grandson,  had  him\nwrapped in a wool blanket. She stood\nbeaming  under  a  dull  gray  sky  tears\nstreaming  down  her  cheeks,  the\nneedle-cold  wind  blowing  her  hair,\nand  clutching  that  baby  in  her  arms\nlike  she  never  wanted  to  let  go.  Not\nthis time. She handed him to Hassan\nand he handed him to me and I sang\nthe prayer of Ayat-ul-kursi in that little\nboy's ear.<br><br>   They  named  him  Sohrab,  after\nHassan's  favorite  hero  from  the\nShahnamah,  as  you  know,  Amir  jan.\nHe  was  a  beautiful  little  boy,  sweet\nas  sugar,  and  had  the  same\ntemperament  as  his  father.  You\nshould have seen Sanaubar with that\nbaby,  Amir  jan.  He  became  the\ncenter  of  her  existence.  She  sewed\nclothes  for  him,  built  him  toys  from\nscraps  of  wood,  rags,  and  dried\ngrass.  When  he  caught  a  fever,  she\nstayed  up  all  night,  and  fasted  for", "three  days.  She  burned  isfand  for\nhim on a skillet to cast out nazar, the\nevil eye. By the time Sohrab was two,\nhe  was  calling  her  Sasa.  The  two  of\nthem were inseparable.<br><br>   She  lived  to  see  him  turn  four,  and\nthen,  one  morning,  she  just  did  not\nwake up. She looked calm, at peace,\nlike  she  did  not  mind  dying  now.  We\nburied her in the cemetery on the hill,\nthe  one  by  the  pomegranate  tree,\nand  I  said  a  prayer  for  her  too.  The\nloss  was  hard  on  Hassan--it  always\nhurts  more  to  have  and  lose  than  to\nnot have in the first place. But it was\neven harder on little Sohrab. He kept\nwalking around the house, looking for\nSasa, but you know how children are,\nthey forget so quickly.<br><br>   By  then--that  would  have  been\n1995--the  Shorawi  were  defeated\nand long gone and Kabul belonged to\nMassoud,  Rabbani,  and  the\nMujahedin.  The  infighting  between\nthe  factions  was  fierce  and  no  one", "knew if they would live to see the end\nof  the  day.  Our  ears  became\naccustomed  to  the  whistle  of  falling\nshells,  to  the  rumble  of  gunfire,  our\neyes  familiar  with  the  sight  of  men\ndigging  bodies  out  of  piles  of  rubble.\nKabul in those days, Amir jan, was as\nclose  as  you  could  get  to  that\nproverbial  hell  on  earth.  Allah  was\nkind  to  us,  though.  The  Wazir  Akbar\nKhan  area  was  not  attacked  as\nmuch,  so  we  did  not  have  it  as  bad\nas some of the other neighborhoods.<br><br> On those days when the rocket fire\neased  up  a  bit  and  the  gunfighting\nwas light, Hassan would take Sohrab\nto  the  zoo  to  see  Marjan  the  lion,  or\nto  the  cinema.  Hassan  taught  him\nhow to shoot the slingshot, and, later,\nby the time he was eight, Sohrab had\nbecome  deadly  with  that  thing:  He\ncould  stand  on  the  terrace  and  hit  a\npinecone  propped  on  a  pail  halfway\nacross  the  yard.  Hassan  taught  him\nto  read  and  write--his  son  was  not\ngoing to grow up illiterate like he had.", "I  grew  very  attached  to  that  little\nboy--I  had  seen  him  take  his  first\nstep, \nheard  him  utter  his  first  word.  I\nbought  children's  books  for  Sohrab\nfrom  the  bookstore  by  Cinema\nPark--they  have  destroyed  that  too\nnow--and  Sohrab  read  them  as\nquickly as I could get them to him. He\nreminded  me  of  you,  how  you  loved\nto  read  when  you  were  little,  Amir\njan.  Sometimes,  I  read  to  him  at\nnight,  played  riddles  with  him,  taught\nhim card tricks. I miss him terribly.<br><br>   In  the  wintertime,  Hassan  took  his\nson  kite  running.  There  were  not\nnearly  as  many  kite  tournaments  as\nin  the  old  days--no  one  felt  safe\noutside  for  too  long--but  there  were\nstill  a  few  scattered  tournaments.\nHassan  would  prop  Sohrab  on  his\nshoulders  and  they  would  go  trotting\nthrough  the  streets,  running  kites,\nclimbing  trees  where  kites  had\ndropped.  You  remember,  Amir  jan,\nwhat  a  good  kite  runner  Hassan", "was? He was still just as good. At the\nend  of  winter,  Hassan  and  Sohrab\nwould hang the kites they had run all\nwinter  on  the  walls  of  the  main\nhallway. They would put them up like\npaintings.<br><br>   I  told  you  how  we  all  celebrated  in\n1996  when  the  Taliban  rolled  in  and\nput  an  end  to  the  daily  fighting.  I\nremember  coming  home  that  night\nand  finding  Hassan  in  the  kitchen,\nlistening to the radio. He had a sober\nlook  in  his  eyes.  I  asked  him  what\nwas  wrong,  and  he  just  shook  his\nhead.  \"God  help  the  Hazaras  now,\nRahim Khan sahib,\" he said.<br><br>   \"The  war  is  over,  Hassan,\"  I  said.\n\"There's  going  to  be  peace,\nInshallah,  and  happiness  and  calm.\nNo  more  rockets,  no  more  killing,  no\nmore funerals!\" But he just turned off\nthe  radio  and  asked  if  he  could  get\nme anything before he went to bed.<br><br>   A  few  weeks  later,  the  Taliban", "banned  kite  fighting.  And  two  years\nlater,  in  1998,  they  massacred  the\nHazaras in Mazar-i-Sharif.", "#$#$Chapter 17#$#$\n  \nRahim  Khan  slowly  uncrossed  his\nlegs and leaned against the bare wall\nin the wary, deliberate way of a man\nwhose  every  movement  triggers\nspikes  of  pain.  Outside,  a  donkey\nwas  braying  and  some  one  was\nshouting something in Urdu. The sun\nwas  beginning  to  set,  glittering  red\nthrough  the  cracks  between  the\nramshackle buildings.<br><br> It hit me again, the enormity of what\nI  had  done  that  winter  and  that\nfollowing  summer.  The  names  rang\nin  my  head:  Hassan,  Sohrab,  Ali,\nFarzana,  and  Sanaubar.  Hearing\nRahim  Khan  speak  Ali's  name  was\nlike  finding  an  old  dusty  music  box\nthat hadn't been opened in years; the\nmelody  began  to  play  immediately:\nWho did you eat today, Babalu? Who\ndid you eat, you slant-eyed Babalu? I\ntried  to  conjure  Ali's  frozen  face,  to\nreally  see  his  tranquil  eyes,  but  time", "can  be  a  greedy  thing--sometimes  it\nsteals all the details for itself.<br><br> \"Is Hassan still in that house now?\"\nI asked.<br><br>   Rahim  Khan  raised  the  teacup  to\nhis  parched  lips  and  took  a  sip.  He\nthen  fished  an  envelope  from  the\nbreast pocket of his vest and handed\nit to me. \"For you.\"<br><br> I tore the sealed envelope. Inside, I\nfound  a  Polaroid  photograph  and  a\nfolded  letter.  I  stared  at  the\nphotograph for a full minute.<br><br> A tall man dressed in a white turban\nand  a  green-striped  chapan  stood\nwith  a  little  boy  in  front  of  a  set  of\nwrought-iron  gates.  Sunlight  slanted\nin from the left, casting a shadow on\nhalf  of  his  rotund  face.  He  was\nsquinting  and  smiling  at  the  camera,\nshowing a pair of missing front teeth.\nEven  in  this  blurry  Polaroid,  the  man\nin  the  chapan  exuded  a  sense  of", "self-assuredness,  of  ease.  It  was  in\nthe  way  he  stood,  his  feet  slightly\napart,  his  arms  comfortably  crossed\non  his  chest,  his  head  titled  a  little\ntoward  the  sun.  Mostly,  it  was  in  the\nway he smiled. Looking at the photo,\none  might  have  concluded  that  this\nwas  a  man  who  thought  the  world\nhad  been  good  to  him.  Rahim  Khan\nwas  right:  I  would  have  recognized\nhim  if  I  had  bumped  into  him  on  the\nstreet.  The  little  boy  stood  bare  foot,\none  arm  wrapped  around  the  man's\nthigh,  his  shaved  head  resting\nagainst  his  father's  hip.  He  too  was\ngrinning and squinting.<br><br> I unfolded the letter. It was written in\nFarsi.  No  dots  were  omitted,  no\ncrosses  forgotten,  no  words  blurred\ntogether--the handwriting was almost\nchildlike  in  its  neatness.  I  began  to\nread:  In  the  name  of  Allah  the  most\nbeneficent,  the  most  merciful,  Amir\nagha,  with  my  deepest  respects,\nFarzana  jan,  Sohrab,  and  I  pray  that\nthis  latest  letter  finds  you  in  good", "health and in the light \nof  Allah's  good  graces.  Please  offer\nmy  warmest  thanks  to  Rahim  Khan\nsahib  for  carrying  it  to  you.  I  am\nhopeful that one day I will hold one of\nyour  letters  in  my  hands  and  read  of\nyour  life  in  America.  Perhaps  a\nphotograph  of  you  will  even  grace\nour eyes. I have told much about you\nto Farzana jan and Sohrab, about us\ngrowing  up  together  and  playing\ngames  and  running  in  the  streets.\nThey  laugh  at  the  stories  of  all  the\nmischief you and I used to cause!<br><br>   Amir  agha,  Alas  the  Afghanistan  of\nour  youth  is  long  dead.  Kindness  is\ngone  from  the  land  and  you  cannot\nescape  the  killings.  Always  the\nkillings. In Kabul, fear is everywhere,\nin  the  streets,  in  the  stadium,  in  the\nmarkets, it is a part of our lives here,\nAmir agha.

She  asked  the  vendor  how\nmuch  the  potatoes  cost,  but  he  did\nnot  hear  her,  I  think  he  had  a  deaf\near.  So  she  asked  louder  and\nsuddenly a young Talib ran over and\nhit her on the thighs with his wooden\nstick.  He  struck  her  so  hard  she  fell\ndown.  He  was  screaming  at  her  and\ncursing  and  saying  the  Ministry  of\nVice  and  Virtue  does  not  allow\nwomen  to  speak  loudly.  She  had  a\nlarge  purple  bruise  on  her  leg  for\ndays  but  what  could  I  do  except\nstand and watch my wife get beaten?\nIf I fought, that dog would have surely\nput  a  bullet  in  me,  and  gladly!  Then\nwhat  would  happen  to  my  Sohrab?\nThe streets are full enough already of\nhungry  orphans  and  every  day  I\nthank  Allah  that  I  am  alive,  not\nbecause  I  fear  death,  but  because\nmy  wife  has  a  husband  and  my  son\nis not an orphan.<br><br> I wish you could see Sohrab. He is\na good boy. Rahim Khan sahib and I\nhave taught him to read and write so", "he  does  not  grow  up  stupid  like  his\nfather.  And  can  he  shoot  with  that\nslingshot!  I  take  Sohrab  around\nKabul sometimes and buy him candy.\nThere is still a monkey man in Shar-e\nNau and if we run into him, I pay him\nto  make  his  monkey  dance  for\nSohrab.  You  should  see  how  he\nlaughs!  The  two  of  us  often  walk  up\nto  the  cemetery  on  the  hill.  Do  you\nremember  how  we  used  to  sit  under\nthe pomegranate tree there and read\nfrom  the  Shahnamah?  The  droughts\nhave dried the hill and the tree hasn't\nborne fruit in years, but Sohrab and I\nstill  sit  under  its  shade  and  I  read  to\nhim  from  the  Shahnamah.  It  is  not\nnecessary to tell you that his favorite\npart  is  the  one  with  his  namesake,\nRostam and Sohrab. Soon he will be\nable  to  read  from  the  book  himself.  I\nam  a  very  proud  and  very  lucky\nfather.<br><br>   Amir  agha,  Rahim  Khan  sahib  is\nquite ill. He coughs all day and I see\nblood  on  his  sleeve  when  he  wipes", "his  mouth.  He  has  lost  much  weight\nand I wish he would eat a little of the\nshorwa  and  rice  that  Farzana  jan\ncooks  for  him.  But  he  only  takes  a\nbite or two and even that I think is out\nof  courtesy  to  Farzana  jan.  I  am  so\nworried about this dear man I pray for\nhim  every  day.  He  is  leaving  for\nPakistan  in  a  few  days  to  consult\nsome  doctors  there  and,  Inshallah,\nhe  will  return  with  good  news.  But  in\nmy  heart  I  fear  for  him.  Farzana  jan\nand  I  have  told  little  Sohrab  that\nRahim  Khan  sahib  is  going  to  be\nwell. What can we do? He is \nonly  ten  and  he  adores  Rahim  Khan\nsahib.  They  have  grown  so  close  to\neach  other.  Rahim  Khan  sahib  used\nto take him to the bazaar for balloons\nand  biscuits  but  he  is  too  weak  for\nthat now.<br><br>   I  have  been  dreaming  a  lot  lately,\nAmir  agha.  Some  of  them  are\nnightmares,  like  hanged  corpses\nrotting in soccer fields with blood-red\ngrass.  I  wake  up  from  those  short  of", "breath  and  sweaty.  Mostly,  though,  I\ndream  of  good  things,  and  praise\nAllah  for  that.  I  dream  that  Rahim\nKhan  sahib  will  be  well.  I  dream  that\nmy  son  will  grow  up  to  be  a  good\nperson,  a  free  person,  and  an\nimportant  person.  I  dream  that  lawla\nflowers  will  bloom  in  the  streets  of\nKabul  again  and  rubab  music  will\nplay in the samovar houses and kites\nwill  fly  in  the  skies.  And  I  dream  that\nsomeday  you  will  return  to  Kabul  to\nrevisit  the  land  of  our  childhood.

I  folded  the\nnote  and  looked  at  the  photograph\nfor  another  minute.  I  pocketed  both.\n\"How is he?\" I asked. ", "    \"That  letter  was  written  six  months\nago,  a  few  days  before  I  left  for\nPeshawar,\" Rahim Khan said. \"I took\nthe  Polaroid  the  day  before  I  left.  A\nmonth  after  I  arrived  in  Peshawar,  I\nreceived a telephone call from one of\nmy  neighbors  in  Kabul.  He  told  me\nthis story: Soon after I took my leave,\na  rumor  spread  that  a  Hazara  family\nwas  living  alone  in  the  big  house  in\nWazir  Akbar  Khan,  or  so  the  Taliban\nclaim. A pair of Talib officials came to\ninvestigate  and  interrogated  Hassan.\nThey  accused  him  of  lying  when\nHassan  told  them  he  was  living  with\nme  even  though  many  of  the\nneighbors,  including  the  one  who\ncalled me, supported Hassan's story.\nThe  Talibs  said  he  was  a  liar  and  a\nthief like all Hazaras and ordered him\nto  get  his  family  out  of  the  house  by\nsundown.  Hassan  protested.  But  my\nneighbor said the Talibs were looking\nat the big house like--how did he say\nit?--yes, like 'wolves looking at a flock\nof  sheep.'  They  told  Hassan  they\nwould  be  moving  in  to  supposedly", "keep  it  safe  until  I  return.  Hassan\nprotested again.<br><br>   So  they  took  him  to  the  street--\"\n\"No,\" I breathed.<br><br>     \"--and  order  him  to  kneel--\"  \"No.\nGod, no.\"<br><br>   \"--and  shot  him  in  the  back  of  the\nhead.\"<br><br>   \"--Farzana  came  screaming  and\nattacked them--\" \"No.\"<br><br>   \"--shot  her  too.  Self-defense,  they\nclaimed  later--\"  But  all  I  could\nmanage was to whisper \"No. No. No\"\nover and over again.<br><br>\nI KEPT THINKING OF THAT DAY in\n1974, in the hospital room, Just after\nHassan's  harelip  surgery.  Baba,\nRahim  Khan,  Ali,  and  I  had  huddled\naround  Hassan's  bed,  watched  him\nexamine  his  new  lip  in  a  handheld", "mirror.  Now  everyone  in  that  room\nwas  either  dead  or  dying.  Except  for\nme.<br><br>   Then  I  saw  something  else:  a  man\ndressed  in  a  herringbone  vest\npressing  the  muzzle  of  his\nKalashnikov  to  the  back  of  Hassan's\nhead.  The  blast  echoes  through  the\nstreet  of  my  father's  house.  Hassan\nslumps  to  the  asphalt,  his  life  of\nunrequited  loyalty  drifting  from  him\nlike  the  windblown  kites  he  used  to\nchase.<br><br>   \"The  Taliban  moved  into  the\nhouse,\"  Rahim  Khan  said.  \"The\npretext  was  that  they  had  evicted  a\ntrespasser.  Hassan's  and  Farzana's\nmurders were dismissed as a case of\nself-defense.  No  one  said  a  word\nabout  it.  Most  of  it  was  fear  of  the\nTaliban,  I  think.  But  no  one  was\ngoing  to  risk  anything  for  a  pair  of\nHazara servants.\"<br><br>   \"What  did  they  do  with  Sohrab?\"  I", "asked.  I  felt  tired,  drained.  A\ncoughing fit gripped Rahim Khan and\nwent  on  for  a  long  time.  When  he\nfinally  looked  up,  his  face  was\nflushed  and  his  eyes  bloodshot.  \"I\nheard  he's  in  an  orphanage\nsomewhere  in  Karteh  Seh.  Amir\njan--\"  then  he  was  coughing  again.\nWhen  he  stopped,  he  looked  older\nthan  a  few  moments  before,  like  he\nwas  aging  with  each  coughing  fit.\n\"Amir  jan,  I  summoned  you  here\nbecause I wanted to see you before I\ndie, but that's not all.\" <br><br> I said nothing. I think I already knew\nwhat he was going to say.<br><br>   \"I  want  you  to  go  to  Kabul  I  want\nyou to bring Sohrab here,\" he said.<br><br> I struggled to find the right words. I'd\nbarely  had  time  to  deal  with  the  fact\nthat Hassan was dead.<br><br>   \"Please  hear  me.

It has never been\nabout money with me, you know that.\nAnd  why  you?  I  think  we  both  know\nwhy it has to be you, don't we?\"<br><br>     I  didn't  want  to  understand  that\ncomment, but I did. I understood it all\ntoo well. \"I have a wife in America, a\nhome,  a  career,  and  a  family.  Kabul\nis a dangerous place, you know that,\nand  you'd  have  me  risk  everything\nfor...\" I stopped.<br><br> \"You know,\" Rahim Khan said, \"one\ntime,  when  you  weren't  around,  your\nfather  and  I  were  talking.

I\nwonder,  is  that  what  you've\nbecome?\"<br><br> I dropped my eyes.<br><br>   \"What  I'm  asking  from  you  is  to\ngrant an old man his dying wish,\" he\nsaid gravely.<br><br> He had gambled with that comment.\nPlayed his best card. Or so I thought\nthen.  His  words  hung  in  limbo\nbetween  us,  but  at  least  he'd  known\nwhat  to  say.  I  was  still  searching  for\nthe  right  words,  and  I  was  the  writer\nin the room. Finally, I settled for this:\n\"Maybe Baba was right.\"<br><br> \"I'm sorry you think that, Amir.\"<br><br>   I  couldn't  look  at  him.  \"And  you\ndon't?\" ", "  \"If I did, I would not have asked you\nto come here.\"<br><br>   I  toyed  with  my  wedding  ring.\n\"You've  always  thought  too  highly  of\nme, Rahim Khan.\"<br><br>   \"And  you've  always  been  far  too\nhard  on  yourself.\"  He  hesitated.  \"But\nthere's  something  else.

The  room  was\nswooping up and down, swaying side\nto  side.  \"Did  Hassan  know?\"  I  said\nthrough  lips  that  didn't  feel  like  my\nown.

To Hassan? He had sat\nme  on  his  lap  when  I  was  little,\nlooked  me  straight  in  the  eyes,  and\nsaid,  There  is  only  one  sin.  And  that\nis  theft...

And\nhow was I going to reconcile this new\nimage of Baba with the one that had\nbeen  imprinted  on  my  mind  for  so\nlong, that of him in his old brown suit,\nhobbling  up  the  Taheris'  driveway  to\nask  for  Soraya's  hand?  Here  is\nanother  cliche  my  creative  writing\nteacher  would  have  scoffed  at;  like\nfather,  like  son.  But  it  was  true,\nwasn't it?

But  I  wondered.\nTrue,  I  hadn't  made  Ali  step  on  the\nland  mine,  and  I  hadn't  brought  the\nTaliban  to  the  house  to  shoot\nHassan. But I had driven Hassan and\nAli  out  of  the  house.  Was  it  too\nfarfetched  to  imagine  that  things\nmight  have  turned  out  differently  if  I\nhadn't?  Maybe  Baba  would  have\nbrought  them  along  to  America.\nMaybe  Hassan  would  have  had  a\nhome of his own now, a job, a family,\na  life  in  a  country  where  no  one\ncared  that  he  was  a  Hazara,  where\nmost people didn't even know what a\nHazara  was.

On  his\nhead,  he  wore  a  brown  pakol,  tilted\nslightly to one side, like the Tajik hero\nAhmad  Shah  Massoud--referred  to\nby Tajiks as \"the Lion of Panjsher.\"<br><br>   It  was  Rahim  Khan  who  had\nintroduced  me  to  Farid  in  Peshawar.\nHe  told  me  Farid  was  twenty-nine,\nthough he had the wary, lined face of\na  man  twenty  years  older.

I\nslumped  a  little  in  my  seat,  arms\nfolded across my chest, forgetting for\na  moment  about  the  nausea.  But  I\nneedn't  have  worried.  Two  Pakistani\nmilitia  approached  our  dilapidated\nLand  Cruiser,  took  a  cursory  glance\ninside, and waved us on. <br><br>   Farid  was  first  on  the  list  of", "preparations  Rahim  Khan  and  I\nmade, a list that included exchanging\ndollars  for  Kaldar  and  Afghani  bills,\nmy  garment  and  pakol--ironically,  I'd\nnever  worn  either  when  I'd  actually\nlived  in  Afghanistan--the  Polaroid  of\nHassan  and  Sohrab,  and,  finally,\nperhaps  the  most  important  item:  an\nartificial  beard,  black  and  chest\nlength, Shari'a friendly--or at least the\nTaliban  version  of  Shari'a.  Rahim\nKhan  knew  of  a  fellow  in  Peshawar\nwho  specialized  in  weaving  them,\nsometimes  for  Western  journalists\nwho covered the war.<br><br> Rahim Khan had wanted me to stay\nwith  him  a  few  more  days,  to  plan\nmore thoroughly. But I knew I had to\nleave  as  soon  as  possible.  I  was\nafraid  I'd  change  my  mind.  I  was\nafraid  I'd  deliberate,  ruminate,\nagonize,  rationalize,  and  talk  myself\ninto not going.

And from\nthis  one  last  chance  at  redemption.\nSo  I  left  before  there  was  any\npossibility  of  that  happening.  As  for\nSoraya,  telling  her  I  was  going  back\nto  Afghanistan  wasn't  an  option.

Why do you do\nthat?\"<br><br>   In  his  rearview  mirror,  I  saw\nsomething  flash  in  his  eyes.  \"You\nwant  to  know?\"  he  sneered.  \"Let  me\nimagine,  Agha  sahib.

The main pass\nhad  descended  from  Landi  Kotal\nthrough  Shinwari  territory  to  Landi\nKhana.  We'd  entered  Afghanistan  at\nTorkham.  Pine  trees  flanked  the\nroad,  fewer  than  I  remembered  and\nmany  of  them  bare,  but  it  was  good\nto  see  trees  again  after  the  arduous\ndrive  through  the  Khyber  Pass.  We\nwere  getting  closer  to  Jalalabad,\nwhere Farid had a brother who would\ntake us in for the night.<br><br>   The  sun  hadn't  quite  set  when  we\ndrove  into  Jalalabad,  capital  of  the\nstate  of  Nangarhar,  a  city  once\nrenowned  for  its  fruit  and  warm\nclimate.  Farid  drove  past  the\nbuildings  and  stone  houses  of  the\ncity's central district. There weren't as\nmany  palm  trees  there  as  I\nremembered,  and  some  of  the\nhomes had been reduced to roofless\nwalls and piles of twisted clay. <br><br> Farid turned onto a narrow unpaved", "road  and  parked  the  Land  Cruiser\nalong  a  dried-up  gutter.  I  slid  out  of\nthe truck, stretched, and took a deep\nbreath.  In  the  old  days,  the  winds\nswept  through  the  irrigated  plains\naround  Jalalabad  where  farmers\ngrew  sugarcane,  and  impregnated\nthe  city's  air  with  a  sweet  scent.  I\nclosed my eyes and searched for the\nsweetness. I didn't find it.<br><br>   \"Let's  go,\"  Farid  said  impatiently.\nWe  walked  up  the  dirt  road  past  a\nfew  leafless  poplars  along  a  row  of\nbroken  mud  walls.  Farid  led  me  to  a\ndilapidated  one-story  house  and\nknocked on the woodplank door.<br><br>   A  young  woman  with  ocean-green\neyes  and  a  white  scarf  draped\naround her face peeked out. She saw\nme  first,  flinched,  spotted  Farid  and\nher  eyes  lit  up.  \"Salaam  alaykum,\nKaka Farid!\"<br><br> \"Salaam, Maryam jan,\" Farid replied\nand  gave  her  something  he'd  denied", "me all day: a warm smile. He planted\na  kiss  on  the  top  of  her  head.  The\nyoung  woman  stepped  out  of  the\nway,  eyeing  me  a  little\napprehensively  as  I  followed  Farid\ninto the small house.<br><br>   The  adobe  ceiling  was  low,  the  dirt\nwalls entirely bare, and the only light\ncame from a pair of lanterns set in a\ncorner.  We  took  off  our  shoes  and\nstepped  on  the  straw  mat  that\ncovered  the  floor.  Along  one  of  the\nwalls  sat  three  young  boys,\ncross-legged,  on  a  mattress  covered\nwith a blanket with shredded borders.\n    A  tall  bearded  man  with  broad\nshoulders stood up to greet us.

He  left  us\nalone and went to greet the boys. ", "    Wahid  sat  with  me  against  the  wall\nacross  from  the  boys,  who  had\nambushed  Farid  and  climbed  his\nshoulders.  Despite  my  protests,\nWahid  ordered  one  of  the  boys  to\nfetch  another  blanket  so  I'd  be  more\ncomfortable  on  the  floor,  and  asked\nMaryam  to  bring  me  some  tea.  He\nasked about the ride from Peshawar,\nthe drive over the Khyber Pass.<br><br> \"I hope you didn't come across any\ndozds,\"  he  said.  The  Khyber  Pass\nwas  as  famous  for  its  terrain  as  for\nthe  bandits  who  used  that  terrain  to\nrob  travelers.  Before  I  could  answer,\nhe  winked  and  said  in  a  loud  voice,\n\"Of  course  no  dozd  would  waste  his\ntime  on  a  car  as  ugly  as  my\nbrother's.\"<br><br>     Farid  wrestled  the  smallest  of  the\nthree boys to the floor and tickled him\non  the  ribs  with  his  good  hand.  The\nkid  giggled  and  kicked.  \"At  least  I\nhave  a  car,\"  Farid  panted.  \"How  is\nyour donkey these days?\" ", "    \"My  donkey  is  a  better  ride  than\nyour car.\"<br><br>   \"Khar  khara  mishnassah,\"  Farid\nshot back. Takes a donkey to know a\ndonkey. They all laughed and I joined\nin.  I  heard  female  voices  from  the\nadjoining room. I could see half of the\nroom  from  where  I  sat.  Maryam  and\nan  older  woman  wearing  a  brown\nhijab--presumably  her  mother--were\nspeaking  in  low  voices  and  pouring\ntea from a kettle into a pot.<br><br>   \"So  what  do  you  do  in  America,\nAmir agha?\" Wahid asked.<br><br>   \"I'm  a  writer,\"  I  said.  I  thought  I\nheard Farid chuckle at that.<br><br>   \"A  writer?\"  Wahid  said,  clearly\nimpressed.  \"Do  you  write  about\nAfghanistan?\"<br><br>   \"Well,  I  have.  But  not  currently,\"  I\nsaid.  My  last  novel,  A  Season  for\nAshes,  had  been  about  a  university", "professor who joins a clan of gypsies\nafter he finds his wife in bed with one\nof his students. It wasn't a bad book.\nSome  reviewers  had  called  it  a\n\"good\" book, and one had even used\nthe  word  \"riveting.\"  But  suddenly  I\nwas  embarrassed  by  it.  I  hoped\nWahid  wouldn't  ask  what  it  was\nabout.<br><br>   \"Maybe  you  should  write  about\nAfghanistan again,\" Wahid said. \"Tell\nthe rest of the world what the Taliban\nare doing to our country.\"<br><br>   \"Well,  I'm  not...  I'm  not  quite  that\nkind of writer.\"<br><br>   \"Oh,\"  Wahid  said,  nodding  and\nblushing  a  bit.  \"You  know  best,  of\ncourse. It's not for me to suggest... <br><br>   Just  then,  Maryam  and  the  other\nwoman  came  into  the  room  with  a\npair  of  cups  and  a  teapot  on  a  small\nplatter. I stood up in respect, pressed\nmy hand to my chest, and bowed my\nhead. \"Salaam alaykum,\" I said. ", "  The woman, who had now wrapped\nher  hijab  to  conceal  her  lower  face,\nbowed  her  head  too.  \"Salaam,\"  she\nreplied  in  a  barely  audible  voice.  We\nnever made eye contact. She poured\nthe tea while I stood.<br><br>   The  woman  placed  the  steaming\ncup  of  tea  before  me  and  exited  the\nroom, her bare feet making no sound\nat all as she disappeared. I sat down\nand  sipped  the  strong  black  tea.\nWahid  finally  broke  the  uneasy\nsilence that followed.<br><br>   \"So  what  brings  you  back  to\nAfghanistan?\"<br><br>   \"What  brings  them  all  back  to\nAfghanistan,  dear  brother?\"  Farid\nsaid, speaking to Wahid but fixing me\nwith a contemptuous gaze.<br><br> \"Bas!\" Wahid snapped.<br><br>   \"It's  always  the  same  thing,\"  Farid", "said.  \"Sell  this  land,  sell  that  house,\ncollect the money, and run away like\na mouse. Go back to America, spend\nthe  money  on  a  family  vacation  to\nMexico.\"<br><br> \"Farid!\" Wahid roared. His children,\nand  even  Farid,  flinched.  \"Have  you\nforgotten  your  manners?  This  is  my\nhouse! Amir agha is my guest tonight\nand  I  will  not  allow  you  to  dishonor\nme like this!\"<br><br>   Farid  opened  his  mouth,  almost\nsaid  something,  reconsidered  and\nsaid nothing. He slumped against the\nwall,  muttered  something  under  his\nbreath,  and  crossed  his  mutilated\nfoot over the good one. His accusing\neyes never left me.<br><br>   \"Forgive  us,  Amir  agha,\"  Wahid\nsaid.  \"Since  childhood,  my  brother's\nmouth  has  been  two  steps  ahead  of\nhis head.\" <br><br> \"It's my fault, really,\" I said, trying to\nsmile  under  Farid's  intense  gaze.  \"I", "am  not  offended.  I  should  have\nexplained to him my business here in\nAfghanistan.  I  am  not  here  to  sell\nproperty. I'm going to Kabul to find a\nboy.\"<br><br> \"A boy,\" Wahid repeated.<br><br> \"Yes.\" I fished the Polaroid from the\npocket  of  my  shirt.  Seeing  Hassan's\npicture  again  tore  the  fresh  scab  off\nhis death. I had to turn my eyes away\nfrom  it.  I  handed  it  to  Wahid.  He\nstudied the photo. Looked from me to\nthe  photo  and  back  again.  \"This\nboy?\"<br><br> I nodded.<br><br> \"This Hazara boy.\"<br><br> \"Yes.\"<br><br> \"What does he mean to you?\"<br><br> \"His father meant a lot to me. He is\nthe  man  in  the  photo.  He's  dead", "now.\"<br><br>   Wahid  blinked.  \"He  was  a  friend  of\nyours?\"<br><br> My instinct was to say yes, as if, on\nsome  deep  level,  I  too  wanted  to\nprotect  Baba's  secret.  But  there  had\nbeen  enough  lies  already.  \"He  was\nmy half-brother.\" I swallowed. Added,\n\"My illegitimate half brother.\" I turned\nthe teacup. Toyed with the handle.<br><br> \"I didn't mean to pry.\"<br><br> \"You're not prying,\" I said. <br><br> \"What will you do with him?\"<br><br> \"Take him back to Peshawar. There\nare people there who will take care of\nhim.\"<br><br>   Wahid  handed  the  photo  back  and\nrested his thick hand on my shoulder.\n\"You  are  an  honorable  man,  Amir\nagha. A true Afghan.\" ", "  I cringed inside.<br><br>   \"I  am  proud  to  have  you  in  our\nhome tonight,\" Wahid said. I thanked\nhim  and  chanced  a  glance  over  to\nFarid.  He  was  looking  down  now,\nplaying  with  the  frayed  edges  of  the\nstraw mat.<br><br>\nA  SHORT  WHILE  LATER,  Maryam\nand her mother brought two steaming\nbowls  of  vegetable  shorwa  and  two\nloaves  of  bread.  \"I'm  sorry  we  can't\noffer  you  meat,\"  Wahid  said.  \"Only\nthe Taliban can afford meat now.\"<br><br> \"This looks wonderful,\" I said. It did\ntoo.  I  offered  some  to  him,  to  the\nkids,  but  Wahid  said  the  family  had\neaten  before  we  arrived.  Farid  and  I\nrolled  up  our  sleeves,  dipped  our\nbread in the shorwa, and ate with our\nhands.<br><br> As I ate, I noticed Wahid's boys, all", "three  thin  with  dirtcaked  faces  and\nshort-cropped  brown  hair  under  their\nskullcaps,  stealing  furtive  glances  at\nmy  digital  wristwatch.  The  youngest\nwhispered  something  in  his  brother's\near.  The  brother  nodded,  didn't  take\nhis  eyes  off  my  watch.  The  oldest  of\nthe boys--I guessed his age at about\ntwelve--rocked  back  and  forth,  his\ngaze  glued  to  my  wrist.  After  dinner,\nafter  I'd  washed  my  hands  with  the\nwater  Maryam  poured  from  a  clay\npot, I asked for Wahid's permission to\ngive his boys a hadia, a gift. He said\nno,  but,  when  I  insisted,  he\nreluctantly  agreed.  I  unsnapped  the\nwristwatch  and  gave  it  to  the\nyoungest  of  the  three  boys.  He\nmuttered a sheepish \"Tashakor.\" <br><br>   \"It  tells  you  the  time  in  any  city  in\nthe  world,\"  I  told  him.  The  boys\nnodded  politely,  passing  the  watch\nbetween  them,  taking  turns  trying  it\non.  But  they  lost  interest  and,  soon,\nthe  watch  sat  abandoned  on  the\nstraw mat. ", "    \"You  COULD  HAVE  TOLD  ME,\"\nFarid  said  later.  The  two  of  us  were\nlying next to each other on the straw\nmats Wahid's wife had spread for us.<br><br> \"Told you what?\"<br><br>   \"Why  you've  come  to  Afghanistan.\"\nHis voice had lost the rough edge I'd\nheard  in  it  since  the  moment  I  had\nmet him.<br><br> \"You didn't ask,\" I said.<br><br> \"You should have told me.\"<br><br> \"You didn't ask.\"<br><br> He rolled to face me. Curled his arm\nunder  his  head.  \"Maybe  I  will  help\nyou find this boy.\"<br><br> \"Thank you, Farid,\" I said.<br><br> \"It was wrong of me to assume.\"<br><br>   I  sighed.  \"Don't  worry.  You  were", "more right than you know.\"<br><br>\nHIS HANDS ARE TIED BEHIND HIM\nwith  roughly  woven  rope  cutting\nthrough  the  flesh  of  his  wrists.  He  is\nblindfolded  with  black  cloth.  He  is\nkneeling on the street, on the edge of\na gutter filled with still water, his head\ndrooping between his \nshoulders. His knees roll on the hard\nground  and  bleed  through  his  pants\nas  he  rocks  in  prayer.  It  is  late\nafternoon  and  his  long  shadow\nsways  back  and  forth  on  the  gravel.\nHe  is  muttering  something  under  his\nbreath.  I  step  closer.  A  thousand\ntimes  over,  he  mutters.  For  you  a\nthousand  times  over.  Back  and  forth\nhe  rocks.  He  lifts  his  face.

He  is  tall,", "dressed  in  a  herringbone  vest  and  a\nblack  turban.  He  looks  down  at  the\nblindfolded man before him with eyes\nthat  show  nothing  but  a  vast,\ncavernous  emptiness.  He  takes  a\nstep  back  and  raises  the  barrel.\nPlaces it on the back of the kneeling\nman's  head.  For  a  moment,  fading\nsunlight  catches  in  the  metal  and\ntwinkles.<br><br>   The  rifle  roars  with  a  deafening\ncrack.<br><br> I follow the barrel on its upward arc.\nI  see  the  face  behind  the  plume  of\nsmoke swirling from the muzzle.

Stood  in  the\nsilver  tarnish  of  a  half-moon  and\nglanced  up  to  a  sky  riddled  with", "stars.  Crickets  chirped  in  the\nshuttered  darkness  and  a  wind\nwafted through the trees. The ground\nwas  cool  under  my  bare  feet  and\nsuddenly,  for  the  first  time  since  we\nhad  crossed  the  border,  I  felt  like  I\nwas back. After all these years, I was\nhome  again,  standing  on  the  soil  of\nmy  ancestors.  This  was  the  soil  on\nwhich  my  great-grandfather  had\nmarried  his  third  wife  a  year  before\ndying in the cholera epidemic that hit\nKabul in 1915. She'd borne him what\nhis first two wives had failed to, a son\nat  last.  It  was  on  this  soil  that  my\ngrandfather  had  gone  on  a  hunting\ntrip  with  King  Nadir  Shah  and  shot  a\ndeer.  My  mother  had  died  on  this\nsoil. And on this soil, I had fought for\nmy father's love.<br><br> I sat against one of the house's clay\nwalls.  The  kinship  I  felt  suddenly  for\nthe  old  land...  it  surprised  me.  I'd\nbeen gone long enough to forget and\nbe  forgotten.  I  had  a  home  in  a  land\nthat  might  as  well  be  in  another", "galaxy to the \npeople  sleeping  on  the  other  side  of\nthe  wall  I  leaned  against.  I  thought  I\nhad  forgotten  about  this  land.  But  I\nhadn't. And, under the bony glow of a\nhalf-moon,  I  sensed  Afghanistan\nhumming  under  my  feet.  Maybe\nAfghanistan  hadn't  forgotten  me\neither.<br><br>   I  looked  westward  and  marveled\nthat,  somewhere  over  those\nmountains,  Kabul  still  existed.  It\nreally  existed,  not  just  as  an  old\nmemory, or as the heading of an AP\nstory  on  page  15  of  the  San\nFrancisco  Chronicle.  Somewhere\nover  those  mountains  in  the  west\nslept  the  city  where  my  harelipped\nbrother  and  I  had  run  kites.\nSomewhere  over  there,  the\nblindfolded  man  from  my  dream  had\ndied  a  needless  death.  Once,  over\nthose  mountains,  I  had  made  a\nchoice.  And  now,  a  quarter  of  a\ncentury  later,  that  choice  had  landed\nme right back on this soil. ", "  I was about to go back inside when\nI  heard  voices  coming  from  the\nhouse. I recognized one as Wahid's.<br><br> \"--nothing left for the children.\"<br><br>   \"We're  hungry  but  we're  not\nsavages!  He  is  a  guest!  What  was  I\nsupposed  to  do?\"  he  said  in  a\nstrained voice.<br><br>   \"--to  find  something  tomorrow\"  She\nsounded  near  tears.  \"What  do  I\nfeed--\"  I  tiptoed  away.  I  understood\nnow  why  the  boys  hadn't  shown  any\ninterest  in  the  watch.  They  hadn't\nbeen  staring  at  the  watch  at  all.\nThey'd been staring at my food.<br><br>\nWE  SAID  OUR  GOOD-BYES  early\nthe  next  morning.  Just  before  I\nclimbed  into  the  Land  Cruiser,  I\nthanked Wahid for his hospitality. He\npointed to the little house behind him.", "\"This  is  your  home,\"  he  said.  His\nthree  sons  were  standing  in  the\ndoorway  watching  us.  The  little  one\nwas  wearing  the  watch--it  dangled\naround his twiggy wrist.<br><br> I glanced in the side-view mirror as\nwe  pulled  away.  Wahid  stood\nsurrounded by his boys in a cloud of\ndust  whipped  up  by  the  truck.  It\noccurred  to  me  that,  in  a  different\nworld, those boys wouldn't have been\ntoo hungry to chase after the car.<br><br>     Earlier  that  morning,  when  I  was\ncertain  no  one  was  looking,  I  did\nsomething  I  had  done  twenty-six\nyears  earlier:  I  planted  a  fistful  of\ncrumpled money under a mattress.", "#$#$Chapter 20#$#$<br><br>Farid  had  warned  me.  He  had.  But,\nas  it  turned  out,  he  had  wasted  his\nbreath.<br><br> We were driving down the cratered\nroad  that  winds  from  Jalalabad  to\nKabul.  The  last  time  I'd  traveled  that\nroad was in a tarpaulin-covered truck\ngoing the other way. Baba had nearly\ngotten  himself  shot  by  a  singing,\nstoned  Roussi  officer--Baba  had\nmade  me  so  mad  that  night,  so\nscared,  and,  ultimately,  so  proud.\nThe  trek  between  Kabul  and\nJalalabad, a bone-jarring ride down a\nteetering  pass  snaking  through  the\nrocks,  had  become  a  relic  now,  a\nrelic  of  two  wars.  Twenty  years\nearlier,  I  had  seen  some  of  the  first\nwar  with  my  own  eyes.  Grim\nreminders of it were strewn along the\nroad: burned carcasses of old Soviet\ntanks, overturned military trucks gone", "to  rust,  a  crushed  Russian  jeep  that\nhad  plunged  over  the  mountainside.\nThe  second  war,  I  had  watched  on\nmy TV screen. And now I was seeing\nit through Farid's eyes.<br><br>   Swerving  effortlessly  around\npotholes  in  the  middle  of  the  broken\nroad,  Farid  was  a  man  in  his\nelement.  He  had  become  much\nchattier  since  our  overnight  stay  at\nWahid's  house.  He  had  me  sit  in  the\npassenger  seat  and  looked  at  me\nwhen he spoke. He even smiled once\nor  twice.  Maneuvering  the  steering\nwheel  with  his  mangled  hand,  he\npointed to mud-hut villages along the\nway  where  he'd  known  people  years\nbefore.  Most  of  those  people,  he\nsaid,  were  either  dead  or  in  refugee\ncamps  in  Pakistan.  \"And  sometimes\nthe dead are luckier,\" he said. <br><br> He pointed to the crumbled, charred\nremains of a tiny village. It was just a\ntuft of blackened, roofless walls now.\nI saw a dog sleeping along one of the\nwalls.  \"I  had  a  friend  there  once,\"", "Farid  said.  \"He  was  a  very  good\nbicycle  repairman.  He  played  the\ntabla well too. The Taliban killed him\nand  his  family  and  burned  the\nvillage.\"<br><br>   We  drove  past  the  burned  village,\nand the dog didn't move.<br><br>\nIN  THE  OLD  DAYS,  the  drive  from\nJalalabad  to  Kabul  took  two  hours,\nmaybe a little more. It took Farid and\nme  over  four  hours  to  reach  Kabul.\nAnd when we did... Farid warned me\njust  after  we  passed  the  Mahipar\ndam.<br><br> \"Kabul is not the way you remember\nit,\" he said.<br><br> \"So I hear.\"<br><br>   Farid  gave  me  a  look  that  said\nhearing  is  not  the  same  as  seeing.\nAnd  he  was  right.  Because  when", "Kabul  finally  did  unroll  before  us,  I\nwas  certain,  absolutely  certain,  that\nhe  had  taken  a  wrong  turn\nsomewhere.  Farid  must  have  seen\nmy  stupefied  expression;  shuttling\npeople  back  and  forth  to  Kabul,  he\nwould have become familiar with that\nexpression on the faces of those who\nhadn't seen Kabul for a long time.<br><br>   He  patted  me  on  the  shoulder.\n\"Welcome back,\" he said morosely.<br><br>\nRUBBLE  AND  BEGGARS.\nEverywhere I looked, that was what I\nsaw.  I  remembered  beggars  in  the\nold days too--Baba always carried an\nextra  handful  of  Afghani  bills  in  his\npocket  just  for  them;  I'd  never  seen\nhim  deny  a  peddler.  Now,  though,\nthey  squatted  at  every  street  corner,\ndressed  in  shredded  burlap  rags,\nmud-caked hands held out for a coin.\nAnd  the  beggars  were  mostly\nchildren  now,  thin  and  grim-faced,", "some  no  older  than  five  or  six.  They\nsat  in  the  laps  of  their  burqa-clad\nmothers  alongside  gutters  at  busy\nstreet corners and chanted \n\"Bakhshesh,  bakhshesh!\"  And\nsomething  else,  something  I  hadn't\nnoticed  right  away:  Hardly  any  of\nthem sat with an adult male--the wars\nhad  made  fathers  a  rare  commodity\nin Afghanistan.<br><br> We were driving westbound toward\nthe  Karteh-Seh  district  on  what  I\nremembered as a major thoroughfare\nin  the  seventies:  Jadeh  Maywand.\nJust  north  of  us  was  the  bone-dry\nKabul River. On the hills to the south\nstood  the  broken  old  city  wall.  Just\neast  of  it  was  the  Bala  Hissar\nFort--the  ancient  citadel  that  the\nwarlord  Dostum  had  occupied  in\n1992--on  the  Shirdarwaza  mountain\nrange,  the  same  mountains  from\nwhich  Mujahedin  forces  had\nshowered  Kabul  with  rockets\nbetween  1992  and  1996,  inflicting\nmuch  of  the  damage  I  was", "witnessing  now.  The  Shirdarwaza\nrange  stretched  all  the  way  west.  It\nwas  from  those  mountains  that  I\nremember  the  firing  of  the  Topeh\nchasht, the \"noon cannon.\" It went off\nevery  day  to  announce  noontime,\nand also to signal the end of daylight\nfasting  during  the  month  of\nRamadan. You'd hear the roar of that\ncannon  all  through  the  city  in  those\ndays.<br><br>   \"I  used  to  come  here  to  Jadeh\nMaywand  when  I  was  a  kid,\"  I\nmumbled.  \"There  used  to  be  shops\nhere  and  hotels.  Neon  lights  and\nrestaurants.  I  used  to  buy  kites  from\nan  old  man  named  Saifo.  He  ran  a\nlittle  kite  shop  by  the  old  police\nheadquarters.\"<br><br>   \"The  police  headquarters  is  still\nthere,\"  Farid  said.  \"No  shortage  of\npolice  in  this  city  But  you  won't  find\nkites  or  kite  shops  on  Jadeh\nMaywand or anywhere else in Kabul.\nThose days are over.\" ", "    Jadeh  Maywand  had  turned  into  a\ngiant  sand  castle.  The  buildings  that\nhadn't  entirely  collapsed  barely\nstood,  with  caved  in  roofs  and  walls\npierced  with  rockets  shells.  Entire\nblocks  had  been  obliterated  to\nrubble.  I  saw  a  bullet-pocked  sign\nhalf  buried  at  an  angle  in  a  heap  of\ndebris.  It  read  DRINK  COCA  CO--.  I\nsaw children playing in the ruins of a\nwindowless  building  amid  jagged\nstumps  of  brick  and  stone.  Bicycle\nriders and mule-drawn carts swerved\naround  kids,  stray  dogs,  and  piles  of\ndebris.  A  haze  of  dust  hovered  over\nthe city and, across the river, a single\nplume of smoke rose to the sky.<br><br> \"Where are the trees?\" I said.<br><br> \"People cut them down for firewood\nin  the  winter,\"  Farid  said.  \"The\nShorawi cut a lot of them down too.\" <br><br> \"Why?\"<br><br> \"Snipers used to hide in them.\" ", "    A  sadness  came  over  me.\nReturning  to  Kabul  was  like  running\ninto  an  old,  forgotten  friend  and\nseeing  that  life  hadn't  been  good  to\nhim, that he'd become homeless and\ndestitute.<br><br>   \"My  father  built  an  orphanage  in\nShar-e-Kohna,  the  old  city,  south  of\nhere,\" I said.<br><br>   \"I  remember  it,\"  Farid  said.  \"It  was\ndestroyed a few years ago.\"<br><br> \"Can you pull over?\" I said. \"I want\nto take a quick walk here.\"<br><br>   Farid  parked  along  the  curb  on  a\nsmall  backstreet  next  to  a\nramshackle, abandoned building with\nno  door.  \"That  used  to  be  a\npharmacy,\"  Farid  muttered  as  we\nexited  the  truck.  We  walked  back  to\nJadeh  Maywand  and  turned  right,\nheading  west.  \"What's  that  smell?\"  I\nsaid.  Something  was  making  my", "eyes water.<br><br>   \"Diesel,\"  Farid  replied.  \"The  city's\ngenerators  are  always  going  down,\nso electricity is unreliable, and people\nuse diesel fuel.\"<br><br> \"Diesel.

Telling  myself  my  flesh\nhadn't  suddenly  shrunk  against  my\nbones and my heart wasn't battering.\nHere they came. In all their glory.<br><br>   The  red  Toyota  pickup  truck  idled\npast  us.  A  handful  of  stern-faced\nyoung  men  sat  on  their  haunches  in\nthe  cab,  Kalashnikovs  slung  on  their\nshoulders.  They  all  wore  beards  and\nblack  turbans.  One  of  them,  a\ndark-skinned  man  in  his  early\ntwenties  with  thick,  knitted  eyebrows\ntwirled  a  whip  in  his  hand  and\nrhythmically  swatted  the  side  of  the\ntruck with it. His roaming eyes fell on\nme.  Held  my  gaze.  I'd  never  felt  so\nnaked  in  my  entire  life.  Then  the\nTalib spat tobacco-stained spittle and\nlooked  away.  I  found  I  could  breathe\nagain.  The  truck  rolled  down  Jadeh\nMaywand,  leaving  in  its  trail  a  cloud\nof dust.<br><br> \"What is the matter with you?\" Farid", "hissed.<br><br> \"What?\"<br><br>   \"Don't  ever  stare  at  them!

This new\nvoice  belonged  to  an  old  beggar\nsitting  barefoot  on  the  steps  of  a\nbullet-scarred  building.  He  wore  a\nthreadbare  chapan  worn  to  frayed\nshreds  and  a  dirt-crusted  turban.  His\nleft  eyelid  drooped  over  an  empty\nsocket.  With  an  arthritic  hand,  he\npointed  to  the  direction  the  red  truck\nhad  gone.  \"They  drive  around\nlooking.  Looking  and  hoping  that\nsomeone  will  provoke  them.

Let's  go,\"  Farid  said,  pulling\nme by the arm.<br><br>   I  handed  the  old  man  a  hundred\nthousand  Afghanis,  or  the  equivalent\nof  about  three  dollars.  When  he\nleaned  forward  to  take  the  money,\nhis  stench--like  sour  milk  and  feet\nthat  hadn't  been  washed  in\nweeks--flooded my nostrils and made\nmy  gorge  rise.  He  hurriedly  slipped\nthe  money  in  his  waist,  his  lone  eye\ndarting  side  to  side.  \"A  world  of\nthanks  for  your  benevolence,  Agha", "sahib.\"<br><br> \"Do you know where the orphanage\nis in Karteh-Seh?\" I said.<br><br> \"It's not hard to find, it's just west of\nDarulaman Boulevard,\" he said. \"The\nchildren  were  moved  from  here  to\nKarteh-Seh  after  the  rockets  hit  the\nold  orphanage.  Which  is  like  saving\nsomeone  from  the  lion's  cage  and\nthrowing them in the tiger's.\"<br><br>   \"Thank  you,  Agha,\"  I  said.  I  turned\nto go.<br><br> \"That was your first time, nay?\"<br><br> \"I'm sorry?\"<br><br> \"The first time you saw a Talib.\"<br><br>   I  said  nothing.  The  old  beggar\nnodded  and  smiled.

Please  tell  me.\"  Baba  had\nalways described my mother to me in", "broad strokes, like, \"She was a great\nwoman.\"  But  what  I  had  always\nthirsted  for  were  the  details:  the  way\nher  hair  glinted  in  the  sunlight,  her\nfavorite  ice  cream  flavor,  the  songs\nshe  liked  to  hum,  did  she  bite  her\nnails? Baba took his memories \nof  her  to  the  grave  with  him.  Maybe\nspeaking  her  name  would  have\nreminded him of his guilt, of what he\nhad done so soon after she had died.\nOr maybe his loss had been so great,\nhis pain so deep, he couldn't bear to\ntalk about her. Maybe both.<br><br> \"She said, 'I'm so afraid.' And I said,\n'Why?,'  and  she  said,  'Because  I'm\nso  profoundly  happy,  Dr.  Rasul.\nHappiness  like  this  is  frightening.'  I\nasked  her  why  and  she  said,  'They\nonly  let  you  be  this  happy  if  they're\npreparing  to  take  something  from\nyou,'  and  I  said,  'Hush  up,  now.\nEnough of this silliness.\"<br><br> Farid took my arm. \"We should go,\nAmir agha,\" he said softly. I snatched", "my arm away. \"What else? What else\ndid she say?\"<br><br> The old man's features softened. \"I\nwish  I  remembered  for  you.  But  I\ndon't.  Your  mother  passed  away  a\nlong  time  ago  and  my  memory  is  as\nshattered  as  these  buildings.  I  am\nsorry.\"<br><br> \"But even a small thing, anything at\nall.\"<br><br>   The  old  man  smiled.  \"I'll  try  to\nremember  and  that's  a  promise.\nCome back and find me.\"<br><br>   \"Thank  you,\"  I  said.  \"Thank  you  so\nmuch.\"  And  I  meant  it.  Now  I  knew\nmy  mother  had  liked  almond  cake\nwith  honey  and  hot  tea,  that  she'd\nonce used the word \"profoundly,\" that\nshe'd  fretted  about  her  happiness.  I\nhad  just  learned  more  about  my\nmother  from  this  old  man  on  the\nstreet than I ever did from Baba. ", "    Walking  back  to  the  truck,  neither\none  of  us  commented  about  what\nmost  non-Afghans  would  have  seen\nas an improbable coincidence, that a\nbeggar on the street would happen to\nknow  my  mother.  Because  we  both\nknew  that  in  Afghanistan,  and\nparticularly  in  Kabul,  such  absurdity\nwas  commonplace.  Baba  used  to\nsay, \"Take two Afghans who've never\nmet,  put  them  in  a  room  for  ten\nminutes,  and  they'll  figure  out  how\nthey're related.\"<br><br> We left the old man on the steps of\nthat  building.  I  meant  to  take  him  up\non  his  offer,  come  back  and  see  if\nhe'd  unearthed  any  more  stories\nabout  my  mother.  But  I  never  saw\nhim again.<br><br>\n  WE  FOUND  THE  NEW\nORPHANAGE in the northern part of\nKarteh-Seh,  along  the  banks  of  the\ndried-up  Kabul  River.  It  was  a  flat,\nbarracks-style building with splintered", "walls  and  windows  boarded  with\nplanks of wood. Farid had told me on\nthe  way  there  that  Karteh-Seh  had\nbeen  one  of  the  most  war-ravaged\nneighborhoods  in  Kabul,  and,  as  we\nstepped  out  of  the  truck,  the\nevidence  was  overwhelming.  The\ncratered streets were flanked by little\nmore  than  ruins  of  shelled  buildings\nand  abandoned  homes.  We  passed\nthe  rusted  skeleton  of  an  overturned\ncar,  a  TV  set  with  no  screen\nhalf-buried  in  rubble,  a  wall  with  the\nwords ZENDA BAD TAL IRAN! (Long\nlive the Taliban!) sprayed in black.<br><br>   A  short,  thin,  balding  man  with  a\nshaggy  gray  beard  opened  the  door.\nHe  wore  a  ragged  tweed  jacket,  a\nskullcap,  and  a  pair  of  eyeglasses\nwith  one  chipped  lens  resting  on  the\ntip  of  his  nose.  Behind  the  glasses,\ntiny  eyes  like  black  peas  flitted  from\nme  to  Farid.  \"Salaam  alaykum,\"  he\nsaid.<br><br> \"Salaam alaykum,\" I said. I showed", "him  the  Polaroid.  \"We're  searching\nfor this boy.\"<br><br> He gave the photo a cursory glance.\n\"I am sorry. I have never seen him.\"<br><br>   \"You  barely  looked  at  the  picture,\nmy friend,\" Farid said. \"Why not take\na closer look?\"<br><br> \"Lotfan,\" I added. Please.<br><br>   The  man  behind  the  door  took  the\npicture.  Studied  it.  Handed  it  back  to\nme.  \"Nay,  sorry.  I  know  just  about\nevery  single  child  in  this  institution\nand  that  one  doesn't  look  familiar.\nNow,  if  you'll  permit  me,  I  have  work\nto  do.\"  He  closed  the  door.  Locked\nthe bolt.<br><br>   I  rapped  on  the  door  with  my\nknuckles.  \"Agha!  Agha,  please  open\nthe  door.  We  don't  mean  him  any\nharm.\" <br><br> \"I told you. He's not here,\" his voice\ncame  from  the  other  side.  \"Now,", "please go away.\"<br><br> Farid stepped up to the door, rested\nhis forehead on it. \"Friend, we are not\nwith  the  Taliban,\"  he  said  in  a  low,\ncautious voice. \"The man who is with\nme  wants  to  take  this  boy  to  a  safe\nplace.\"<br><br>   \"I  come  from  Peshawar,\"  I  said.  \"A\ngood  friend  of  mine  knows  an\nAmerican  couple  there  who  run  a\ncharity  home  for  children.\"  I  felt  the\nman's  presence  on  the  other  side  of\nthe door. Sensed him standing there,\nlistening,  hesitating,  caught  between\nsuspicion  and  hope.  \"Look,  I  knew\nSohrab's  father,\"  I  said.  \"His  name\nwas Hassan. His mother's name was\nFarzana.  He  called  his  grand  mother\nSasa.  He  knows  how  to  read  and\nwrite.  And  he's  good  with  the\nslingshot.  There's  hope  for  this  boy,\nAgha,  a  way  out.  Please  open  the\ndoor.\"<br><br> From the other side, only silence. ", "  \"I'm his half uncle,\" I said.<br><br>   A  moment  passed.  Then  a  key\nrattled  in  the  lock.  The  man's  narrow\nface  reappeared  in  the  crack.  He\nlooked  from  me  to  Farid  and  back.\n\"You were wrong about one thing.\"<br><br> \"What?\"<br><br> \"He's great with the slingshot.\"<br><br> I smiled.<br><br>   \"He's  inseparable  from  that  thing.\nHe  tucks  it  in  the  waist  of  his  pants\neverywhere he goes.\"<br><br> \nTHE  MAN  WHO  LET  US  IN\nintroduced  himself  as  Zaman,  the\ndirector  of  the  orphanage.  \"I'll  take\nyou to my office,\" he said.<br><br> We followed him through dim, grimy\nhallways  where  barefoot  children", "dressed  in  frayed  sweaters  ambled\naround.  We  walked  past  rooms  with\nno  floor  covering  but  matted  carpets\nand windows shuttered with sheets of\nplastic.  Skeleton  frames  of  steel\nbeds,  most  with  no  mattress,  filled\nthe rooms.<br><br>   \"How  many  orphans  live  here?\"\nFarid asked.<br><br> \"More than we have room for. About\ntwo  hundred  and  fifty,\"  Zaman  said\nover his shoulder. \"But they're not all\nyateem. Many of them have lost their\nfathers  in  the  war,  and  their  mothers\ncan't  feed  them  because  the  Taliban\ndon't  allow  them  to  work.  So  they\nbring their children here.\" He made a\nsweeping  gesture  with  his  hand  and\nadded  ruefully,  \"This  place  is  better\nthan  the  street,  but  not  that  much\nbetter. This building was never meant\nto be lived in--it used to be a storage\nwarehouse  for  a  carpet\nmanufacturer.  So  there's  no  water\nheater  and  they've  let  the  well  go", "dry.\"  He  dropped  his  voice.  \"I've\nasked the Taliban for money to dig a\nnew  well  more  times  than  I\nremember  and  they  just  twirl  their\nrosaries  and  tell  me  there  is  no\nmoney. No money.\" He snickered.<br><br>   He  pointed  to  a  row  of  beds  along\nthe  wall.  \"We  don't  have  enough\nbeds, and not enough mattresses for\nthe  beds  we  do  have.  Worse,  we\ndon't  have  enough  blankets.\"  He\nshowed  us  a  little  girl  skipping  rope\nwith  two  other  kids.  \"You  see  that\ngirl?  This  past  winter,  the  children\nhad  to  share  blankets.  Her  brother\ndied  of  exposure.\"  He  walked  on.\n\"The  last  time  I  checked,  we  have\nless than a month's supply of rice left\nin  the  warehouse,  and,  when  that\nruns out, the children will have to eat\nbread  and  tea  for  breakfast  and\ndinner.\"  I  noticed  he  made  no\nmention of lunch.<br><br>   He  stopped  and  turned  to  me.\n\"There  is  very  little  shelter  here,", "almost  no  food,  no  clothes,  no  clean\nwater.  What  I  have  in  ample  supply\nhere  is  children  who've  lost  their\nchildhood.  But  the  tragedy  is  that\nthese are the lucky ones. We're filled\nbeyond capacity and every day I turn\naway  mothers  who  bring  their\nchildren.\"  He  took  a  step  toward  me.\n\"You say there is hope for Sohrab? I\npray  you  don't  lie,  Agha.  But...  you\nmay well be too late.\"<br><br> \"What do you mean?\" <br><br> Zaman's eyes shifted. \"Follow me.\"<br><br>\nWHAT  PASSED  FOR  THE\nDIRECTOR'S OFFICE was four bare,\ncracked  walls,  a  mat  on  the  floor,  a\ntable,  and  two  folding  chairs.  As\nZaman  and  I  sat  down,  I  saw  a  gray\nrat poke its head from a burrow in the\nwall  and  flit  across  the  room.  I\ncringed  when  it  sniffed  at  my  shoes,\nthen  Zaman's,  and  scurried  through\nthe open door. ", "    \"What  did  you  mean  it  may  be  too\nlate?\" I said.<br><br> \"Would you like some chai? I could\nmake some.\"<br><br> \"Nay, thank you. I'd rather we talk.\"<br><br>   Zaman  tilted  back  in  his  chair  and\ncrossed his arms on his chest. \"What\nI have to tell you is not pleasant. Not\nto  mention  that  it  may  be  very\ndangerous.\"<br><br> \"For whom?\"<br><br>   \"You.  Me.  And,  of  course,  for\nSohrab, if it's not too late already.\"<br><br> \"I need to know,\" I said.<br><br>   He  nodded.  \"So  you  say.  But  first  I\nwant  to  ask  you  a  question:  How\nbadly  do  you  want  to  find  your\nnephew?\" ", "  I thought of the street fights we'd get\ninto when we were kids, all the times\nHassan used to take them on for me,\ntwo  against  one,  sometimes  three\nagainst  one.  I'd  wince  and  watch,\ntempted  to  step  in,  but  always\nstopping  short,  always  held  back  by\nsomething. <br><br> I looked at the hallway, saw a group\nof kids dancing in a circle. A little girl,\nher  left  leg  amputated  below  the\nknee,  sat  on  a  ratty  mattress  and\nwatched,  smiling  and  clapping  along\nwith  the  other  children.  I  saw  Farid\nwatching  the  children  too,  his  own\nmangled  hand  hanging  at  his  side.  I\nremembered  Wahid's  boys  and...  I\nrealized something: I would not leave\nAfghanistan  without  finding  Sohrab.\n\"Tell me where he is,\" I said.<br><br> Zaman's gaze lingered on me. Then\nhe  nodded,  picked  up  a  pencil,  and\ntwirled  it  between  his  fingers.  \"Keep\nmy name out of it.\"<br><br> \"I promise.\" ", "  He tapped the table with the pencil.\n\"Despite  your  promise,  I  think  I'll  live\nto regret this, but perhaps it's just as\nwell.  I'm  damned  anyway.  But  if\nsomething  can  be  done  for  Sohrab...\nI'll tell you because I believe you. You\nhave  the  look  of  a  desperate  man.\"\nHe  was  quiet  for  a  long  time.  \"There\nis  a  Talib  official,\"  he  muttered.  \"He\nvisits  once  every  month  or  two.  He\nbrings  cash  with  him,  not  a  lot,  but\nbetter  than  nothing  at  all.\"  His  shifty\neyes fell on me, rolled away. \"Usually\nhe'll take a girl. But not always.\"<br><br>   \"And  you  allow  this?\"  Farid  said\nbehind me. He was going around the\ntable, closing in on Zaman.<br><br>   \"What  choice  do  I  have?\"  Zaman\nshot  back.  He  pushed  himself  away\nfrom the desk.<br><br>   \"You're  the  director  here,\"  Farid\nsaid.  \"Your  job  is  watch  over  these\nchildren.\" ", "  \"There's nothing I can do to stop it.\"<br><br>   \"You're  selling  children!\"  Farid\nbarked.<br><br>   \"Farid,  sit  down!  Let  it  go!\"  I  said.\nBut I was too late. Because suddenly\nFarid  was  leaping  over  the  table.\nZaman's  chair  went  flying  as  Farid\nfell  on  him  and  pinned  him  to  the\nfloor.  The  director  thrashed  beneath\nFarid and made \nmuffled  screaming  sounds.  His  legs\nkicked a desk drawer free and sheets\nof paper spilled to the floor.<br><br> I ran around the desk and saw why\nZaman's  screaming  was  muffled:\nFarid  was  strangling  him.  I  grasped\nFarid's  shoulders  with  both  hands\nand  pulled  hard.  He  snatched  away\nfrom  me.  \"That's  enough!\"  I  barked.\nBut  Farid's  face  had  flushed  red,  his\nlips pulled back in a snarl. \"I'm killing\nhim!  You  can't  stop  me!  I'm  killing\nhim,\" he sneered. ", "  \"Get off him!\"<br><br>   \"I'm  killing  him!\"  Something  in  his\nvoice  told  me  that  if  I  didn't  do\nsomething quickly I'd witness my first\nmurder.<br><br>   \"The  children  are  watching,  Farid.\nThey're  watching,\"  I  said.  His\nshoulder muscles tightened under my\ngrip and, for a moment, I thought he'd\nkeep  squeezing  Zaman's  neck\nanyway. Then he turned around, saw\nthe  children.  They  were  standing\nsilently  by  the  door,  holding  hands,\nsome  of  them  crying.  I  felt  Farid's\nmuscles  slacken.  He  dropped  his\nhands,  rose  to  his  feet.  He  looked\ndown  on  Zaman  and  dropped  a\nmouthful of spit on his face. Then he\nwalked to the door and closed it.<br><br> Zaman struggled to his feet, blotted\nhis bloody lips with his sleeve, wiped\nthe  spit  off  his  cheek.  Coughing  and\nwheezing, he put on his skullcap, his", "glasses,  saw  both  lenses  had\ncracked,  and  took  them  off.  He\nburied his face in his hands. None of\nus said anything for a long time.<br><br>   \"He  took  Sohrab  a  month  ago,\"\nZaman  finally  croaked,  hands  still\nshielding his face.<br><br> \"You call yourself a director?\" Farid\nsaid.<br><br>   Zaman  dropped  his  hands.  \"I\nhaven't been paid in over six months.\nI'm broke because I've spent my life's\nsavings  on  this  orphanage.\nEverything I ever owned or inherited I\nsold  to  run  this  godforsaken  place.\nYou  think  I  don't  have  family  in\nPakistan  and  Iran?  I  could  have  run\nlike  everyone  else.  But  I  didn't.  I\nstayed.  I  stayed  because  of  them.\"\nHe pointed to the door. \"If I deny him\none  child,  he  takes  ten.  So  I  let  him\ntake  one  and  leave  the  judging  to\nAllah. I swallow \nmy  pride  and  take  his  goddamn", "filthy...  dirty  money.  Then  I  go  to  the\nbazaar and buy food for the children.\"\n  Farid dropped his eyes.<br><br>   \"What  happens  to  the  children  he\ntakes?\" I asked.<br><br>   Zaman  rubbed  his  eyes  with  his\nforefinger  and  thumb.  \"Some  times\nthey come back.\"<br><br> \"Who is he? How do we find him?\" I\nsaid.<br><br>   \"Go  to  Ghazi  Stadium  tomorrow.\nYou'll see him at halftime. He'll be the\none  wearing  black  sunglasses.\"  He\npicked  up  his  broken  glasses  and\nturned them in his hands. \"I want you\nto  go  now.  The  children  are\nfrightened.\"<br><br> He escorted us out.<br><br>   As  the  truck  pulled  away,  I  saw", "Zaman  in  the  side-view  mirror,\nstanding  in  the  doorway.  A  group  of\nchildren  surrounded  him,  clutching\nthe  hem  of  his  loose  shirt.

Baba  used  to  take  me  to\nKhyber  Restaurant  there  for  kabob.\nThe building was \nstill  standing,  but  its  doors  were\npadlocked,  the  windows  shattered,\nand the letters K and R missing from\nits name.<br><br>   I  saw  a  dead  body  near  the\nrestaurant.  There  had  been  a\nhanging.  A  young  man  dangled  from\nthe end of a rope tied to a beam, his\nface  puffy  and  blue,  the  clothes  he'd\nworn  on  the  last  day  of  his  life\nshredded,  bloody.  Hardly  anyone\nseemed to notice him.<br><br> We rode silently through the square\nand  headed  toward  the  Wazir  Akbar\nKhan district. Everywhere I looked, a\nhaze  of  dust  covered  the  city  and  its", "sun-dried  brick  buildings.  A  few\nblocks north of Pashtunistan Square,\nFarid  pointed  to  two  men  talking\nanimatedly  at  a  busy  street  corner.\nOne  of  them  was  hobbling  on  one\nleg,  his  other  leg  amputated  below\nthe  knee.

In  fact,  they  were  in  pretty\ngood  shape.  Trees  still  peeked  over\nthe  walls,  and  the  streets  weren't\nnearly  as  rubble-strewn  as  the  ones\nin  Karteh-Seh.

The\nwindows to the living room, the foyer,\nand  the  upstairs  guest  bathroom\nwere  broken,  patched  haphazardly\nwith sheets of clear plastic or wooden\nboards nailed across the frames. The\npaint,  once  sparkling  white,  had\nfaded  to  ghostly  gray  and  eroded  in\nparts,  revealing  the  layered  bricks\nbeneath.  The  front  steps  had\ncrumbled.  Like  so  much  else  in\nKabul,  my  father's  house  was  the\npicture of fallen splendor.<br><br>   I  found  the  window  to  my  old\nbedroom,  second  floor,  third  window", "south of the main steps to the house.\nI  stood  on  tiptoes,  saw  nothing\nbehind the \nwindow  but  shadows.  Twenty-five\nyears earlier, I had stood behind that\nsame  window,  thick  rain  dripping\ndown  the  panes  and  my  breath\nfogging  up  the  glass.  I  had  watched\nHassan and Ali load their belongings\ninto the trunk of my father's car.<br><br> \"Amir agha,\" Farid called again.<br><br> \"I'm coming,\" I shot back.<br><br> Insanely, I wanted to go in. Wanted\nto  walk  up  the  front  steps  where  Ali\nused  to  make  Hassan  and  me  take\noff  our  snow  boots.  I  wanted  to  step\ninto  the  foyer,  smell  the  orange  peel\nAli  always  tossed  into  the  stove  to\nburn  with  sawdust.  Sit  at  the  kitchen\ntable,  have  tea  with  a  slice  of  naan,\nlisten  to  Hassan  sing  old  Hazara\nsongs.<br><br>   Another  honk.  I  walked  back  to  the", "Land  Cruiser  parked  along  the\nsidewalk.  Farid  sat  smoking  behind\nthe wheel.<br><br> \"I have to look at one more thing,\" I\ntold him.<br><br> \"Can you hurry?\"<br><br> \"Give me ten minutes.\"<br><br>   \"Go,  then.\"  Then,  just  as  I  was\nturning  to  go:  \"Just  forget  it  all.\nMakes it easier.\"<br><br> \"To what?\"<br><br>   \"To  go  on,\"  Farid  said.  He  flicked\nhis cigarette out of the window. \"How\nmuch more do you need to see? Let\nme save you the trouble: Nothing that\nyou  remember  has  survived.  Best  to\nforget.\" <br><br>   \"I  don't  want  to  forget  anymore,\"  I\nsaid. \"Give me ten minutes.\"<br><br>", "WE  HARDLY  BROKE  A  SWEAT,\nHassan and I, when we hiked up the\nhill  just  north  of  Baba's  house.  We\nscampered  about  the  hilltop  chasing\neach  other  or  sat  on  a  sloped  ridge\nwhere  there  was  a  good  view  of  the\nairport  in  the  distance.  We'd  watch\nairplanes  take  off  and  land.  Go\nrunning again.<br><br>   Now,  by  the  time  I  reached  the  top\nof the craggy hill, each ragged breath\nfelt  like  inhaling  fire.  Sweat  trickled\ndown my face. I stood wheezing for a\nwhile, a stitch in my side. Then I went\nlooking  for  the  abandoned  cemetery.\nIt didn't take me long to find it. It was\nstill  there,  and  so  was  the  old\npomegranate tree.<br><br>   I  leaned  against  the  gray  stone\ngateway  to  the  cemetery  where\nHassan  had  buried  his  mother.  The\nold  metal  gates  hanging  off  the\nhinges  were  gone,  and  the\nheadstones  were  barely  visible", "through  the  thick  tangles  of  weeds\nthat  had  claimed  the  plot.  A  pair  of\ncrows  sat  on  the  low  wall  that\nenclosed the cemetery.<br><br>   Hassan  had  said  in  his  letter  that\nthe  pomegranate  tree  hadn't  borne\nfruit  in  years.  Looking  at  the  wilted,\nleafless  tree,  I  doubted  it  ever  would\nagain.  I  stood  under  it,  remembered\nall  the  times  we'd  climbed  it,\nstraddled  its  branches,  our  legs\nswinging,  dappled  sunlight  flickering\nthrough  the  leaves  and  casting  on\nour  faces  a  mosaic  of  light  and\nshadow.  The  tangy  taste  of\npomegranate crept into my mouth.<br><br>   I  hunkered  down  on  my  knees  and\nbrushed  my  hands  against  the  trunk.\nI  found  what  I  was  looking  for.  The\ncarving  had  dulled,  almost  faded\naltogether, but it was still there: \"Amir\nand Hassan. The Sultans of Kabul.\" I\ntraced  the  curve  of  each  letter  with\nmy  fingers.  Picked  small  bits  of  bark\nfrom the tiny crevasses. ", "  I sat cross-legged at the foot of the\ntree  and  looked  south  on  the  city  of\nmy childhood. In those days, treetops\npoked  behind  the  walls  of  every\nhouse.  The  sky  stretched  wide  and\nblue,  and  laundry  drying  on\nclotheslines  glimmered  in  the  sun.  If\nyou  listened  hard,  you  might  even\nhave  heard  the  call  of  the  fruit  seller\npassing  through  Wazir  Akbar  Khan\nwith  his  donkey:  Cherries!  Apricots!\nGrapes!  In  the  early  evening,  you\nwould  have  heard  azan,  the\nmueszzin's**  call  to  prayer  from  the\nmosque in Shar-e-Nau.<br><br>     I  heard  a  honk  and  saw  Farid\nwaving at me. It was time to go.<br><br>\nWE  DROVE  SOUTH  AGAIN,  back\ntoward  Pashtunistan  Square.  We\npassed  several  more  red  pickup\ntrucks  with  armed,  bearded  young\nmen  crammed  into  the  cabs.  Farid\ncursed  under  his  breath  every  time", "we passed one.<br><br>   I  paid  for  a  room  at  a  small  hotel\nnear  Pashtunistan  Square.  Three\nlittle  girls  dressed  in  identical  black\ndresses  and  white  scarves  clung  to\nthe  slight,  bespectacled  man  behind\nthe  counter.  He  charged  me  $75,  an\nunthinkable price given the run-down\nappearance  of  the  place,  but  I  didn't\nmind. Exploitation to finance a beach\nhouse  in  Hawaii  was  one  thing.\nDoing  it  to  feed  your  kids  was\nanother.<br><br> There was no hot running water and\nthe  cracked  toilet  didn't  flush.  Just  a\nsingle  steel-frame  bed  with  a  worn\nmattress,  a  ragged  blanket,  and  a\nwooden  chair  in  the  corner.  The\nwindow  overlooking  the  square  had\nbroken,  hadn't  been  replaced.  As  I\nlowered  my  suitcase,  I  noticed  a\ndried  bloodstain  on  the  wall  behind\nthe bed.<br><br>   I  gave  Farid  some  money  and  he", "went  out  to  get  food.  He  returned\nwith  four  sizzling  skewers  of  kabob,\nfresh naan, and a bowl of white rice.\nWe  sat  on  the  bed  and  all  but\ndevoured  the  food.  There  was  one\nthing  that  hadn't  changed  in  Kabul\nafter all: The kabob was as succulent\nand delicious as I remembered.<br><br> That night, I took the bed and Farid\nlay on the floor, wrapped himself with\nan  extra  blanket  for  which  the  hotel\nowner  charged  me  an  additional  fee.\nNo  light  came  into  the  room  except\nfor  the  moonbeams  streaming\nthrough  the  broken  window.  Farid\nsaid  the  owner  had  told  him  that\nKabul had been without electricity for\ntwo  days  now  and  his  generator\nneeded  fixing.  We  talked  for  a  while.\nHe  told  me  about  growing  up  in\nMazar-i-Sharif,  in  Jalalabad.  He  told\nme about a time shortly after he and\nhis father joined the jihad and fought\nthe  Shorawi  in  the  Panjsher  Valley.\nThey were stranded without food and\nate  locust  to  survive.  He  told  me  of", "the  day  helicopter  gunfire  killed  his\nfather,  of  the  day  the  land  mine  took\nhis  two  daughters.  He  asked  me\nabout  America.  I  told  him  that  in\nAmerica  you  could  step  into  a\ngrocery  store  and  buy  any  of  fifteen\nor  twenty  different  types  of  cereal.\nThe  lamb  was  always  fresh  and  the\nmilk  cold,  the  fruit  plentiful  and  the\nwater  clear.  Every  home  had  a  TV,\nand every TV a \nremote,  and  you  could  get  a  satellite\ndish if you wanted. Receive over five\nhundred channels.<br><br> \"Five hundred?\" Farid exclaimed.<br><br> \"Five hundred.\"<br><br> We fell silent for a while. Just when\nI  thought  he  had  fallen  asleep,  Farid\nchuckled.  \"Agha,  did  you  hear  what\nMullah  Nasrud  din  did  when  his\ndaughter  came  home  and\ncomplained  that  her  husband  had\nbeaten  her?\"  I  could  feel  him  smiling\nin  the  dark  and  a  smile  of  my  own", "formed  on  my  face.  There  wasn't  an\nAfghan  in  the  world  who  didn't  know\nat  least  a  few  jokes  about  the\nbumbling mullah.<br><br> \"What?\"<br><br> \"He beat her too, then sent her back\nto  tell  the  husband  that  Mullah  was\nno  fool:  If  the  bastard  was  going  to\nbeat his daughter, then Mullah would\nbeat his wife in return.\"<br><br>   I  laughed.  Partly  at  the  joke,  partly\nat  how  Afghan  humor  never\nchanged.  Wars  were  waged,  the\nInternet  was  invented,  and  a  robot\nhad  rolled  on  the  surface  of  Mars,\nand  in  Afghanistan  we  were  still\ntelling  Mullah  Nasruddin  jokes.  \"Did\nyou  hear  about  the  time  Mullah  had\nplaced a heavy bag on his shoulders\nand was riding his donkey?\" I said.<br><br> \"No.\"<br><br>   \"Someone  on  the  street  said  why", "don't you put the bag on the donkey?\nAnd  he  said,  \"That  would  be  cruel,\nI'm  heavy  enough  already  for  the\npoor thing.\"<br><br>   We  exchanged  Mullah  Nasruddin\njokes until we ran out of them and we\nfell silent again.<br><br>   \"Amir  agha?\"  Farid  said,  startling\nme from near sleep.<br><br>  \"Yes?\"<br><br>   \"Why  are  you  here?  I  mean,  why\nare you really here?\"<br><br> \"I told you.\"<br><br> \"For the boy?\"<br><br> \"For the boy.\"<br><br>   Farid  shifted  on  the  ground.  \"It's\nhard to believe.\"<br><br>   \"Sometimes  I  myself  can  hardly\nbelieve I'm here.\" ", "    \"No...  What  I  mean  to  ask  is  why\nthat boy? You come all the way from\nAmerica for... a Shi'a?\"<br><br>   That  killed  all  the  laughter  in  me.\nAnd  the  sleep.  \"I  am  tired,\"  I  said.\n\"Let's just get some sleep.\"<br><br>   Farid's  snoring  soon  echoed\nthrough  the  empty  room.  I  stayed\nawake,  hands  crossed  on  my  chest,\nstaring  into  the  starlit  night  through\nthe broken window, and thinking that\nmaybe  what  people  said  about\nAfghanistan was true. Maybe it was a\nhopeless place.<br><br>\nA  BUSTLING  CROWD  was  filling\nGhazi  Stadium  when  we  walked\nthrough  the  entrance  tunnels.\nThousands  of  people  milled  about\nthe  tightly  packed  concrete  terraces.\nChildren  played  in  the  aisles  and\nchased  each  other  up  and  down  the", "steps.  The  scent  of  garbanzo  beans\nin spicy sauce hung in the air, mixed\nwith the \nsmell of dung and sweat. Farid and I\nwalked  past  street  peddlers  selling\ncigarettes, pine nuts, and biscuits.<br><br>   A  scrawny  boy  in  a  tweed  jacket\ngrabbed my elbow and spoke into my\near.  Asked  me  if  I  wanted  to  buy\nsome \"sexy pictures.\"<br><br> \"Very sexy, Agha,\" he said, his alert\neyes  darting  side  to  side--reminding\nme of a girl who, a few years earlier,\nhad  tried  to  sell  me  crack  in  the\nTenderloin  district  in  San  Francisco.\nThe kid peeled one side of his jacket\nopen  and  gave  me  a  fleeting  glance\nof  his  sexy  pictures:  postcards  of\nHindi  movies  showing  doe-eyed\nsultry  actresses,  fully  dressed,  in  the\narms of their leading men. \"So sexy,\"\nhe repeated.<br><br>   \"Nay,  thanks,\"  I  said,  pushing  past\nhim. ", "    \"He  gets  caught,  they'll  give  him  a\nflogging  that  will  waken  his  father  in\nthe grave,\" Farid muttered.<br><br>   There  was  no  assigned  seating,  of\ncourse. No one to show us politely to\nour  section,  aisle,  row,  and  seat.\nThere  never  had  been,  even  in  the\nold  days  of  the  monarchy.  We  found\na  decent  spot  to  sit,  just  left  of\nmidfield, though it took some shoving\nand elbowing on Farid's part.<br><br>   I  remembered  how  green  the\nplaying  field  grass  had  been  in  the\n'70s  when  Baba  used  to  bring  me  to\nsoccer  games  here.  Now  the  pitch\nwas  a  mess.  There  were  holes  and\ncraters  everywhere,  most  notably  a\npair  of  deep  holes  in  the  ground\nbehind the south end goalposts. And\nthere  was  no  grass  at  all,  just  dirt.\nWhen  the  two  teams  finally  took  the\nfield--all  wearing  long  pants  despite\nthe  heat--and  play  began,  it  became\ndifficult to follow the ball in the clouds", "of  dust  kicked  up  by  the  players.\nYoung, whip-toting Talibs roamed the\naisles,  striking  anyone  who  cheered\ntoo loudly.<br><br> They brought them out shortly after\nthe  halftime  whistle  blew.  A  pair  of\ndusty red pickup trucks, like the ones\nI'd  seen  around  town  since  I'd\narrived, rode into the stadium through\nthe gates. The crowd rose to its feet.\nA  woman  dressed  in  a  green  burqa\nsat  in  the  cab  of  one  truck,  a\nblindfolded  man  in  the  other.  The\ntrucks drove around the track, slowly,\nas if to let the crowd get a long look.\nIt  had  the  desired  effect:  People\ncraned their necks, pointed, stood on\ntiptoes.  Next  to  me,  Farid's  Adam's\napple  bobbed  up  and  down  as  he\nmumbled a prayer under his breath.<br><br>   The  red  trucks  entered  the  playing\nfield,  rode  toward  one  end  in  twin\nclouds  of  dust,  sunlight  reflecting  off\ntheir hubcaps. A third truck met them", "at the end of the field. This one's cab\nwas  filled  with  something  and  I\nsuddenly  understood  the  purpose  of\nthose  two  holes  behind  the\ngoalposts.  They  unloaded  the  third\ntruck.  The  crowd  murmured  in\nanticipation.<br><br>   \"Do  you  want  to  stay?\"  Farid  said\ngravely.<br><br>   \"No,\"  I  said.  I  had  never  in  my  life\nwanted  to  be  away  from  a  place  as\nbadly  as  I  did  now.  \"But  we  have  to\nstay.\"<br><br> Two Talibs with Kalashnikovs slung\nacross  their  shoulders  helped  the\nblindfolded  man  from  the  first  truck\nand two others helped the burqa-clad\nwoman. The woman's knees buckled\nunder  her  and  she  slumped  to  the\nground.  The  soldiers  pulled  her  up\nand  she  slumped  again.  When  they\ntried  to  lift  her  again,  she  screamed\nand  kicked.  I  will  never,  as  long  as  I\ndraw breath, forget the sound of that", "scream.  It  was  the  cry  of  a  wild\nanimal  trying  to  pry  its  mangled  leg\nfree  from  the  bear  trap.  Two  more\nTalibs joined in and helped force her\ninto one of the chest-deep holes. The\nblindfolded  man,  on  the  other  hand,\nquietly allowed them to lower him into\nthe  hole  dug  for  him.  Now  only  the\naccused  pair's  torsos  protruded  from\nthe ground.<br><br>   A  chubby,  white-bearded  cleric\ndressed in gray garments stood near\nthe  goalposts  and  cleared  his  throat\ninto  a  handheld  microphone.  Behind\nhim  the  woman  in  the  hole  was  still\nscreaming.  He  recited  a  lengthy\nprayer  from  the  Koran,  his  nasal\nvoice  undulating  through  the  sudden\nhush  of  the  stadium's  crowd.  I\nremembered  something  Baba  had\nsaid  to  me  a  long  time  ago:  Piss  on\nthe  beards  of  all  those  self-righteous\nmonkeys. They do nothing but thumb\ntheir  rosaries  and  recite  a  book\nwritten  in  a  tongue  they  don't  even\nunderstand.  God  help  us  all  if", "Afghanistan  ever  falls  into  their\nhands.<br><br>   When  the  prayer  was  done,  the\ncleric  cleared  his  throat.  \"Brothers\nand  sisters!\"  he  called,  speaking  in\nFarsi,  his  voice  booming  through  the\nstadium. \"We are here today to carry\nout  Shari'a.  We  are  here  today  to\ncarry  out  justice.  We  are  here  today\nbecause  the  will  of  Allah  and  the\nword  of  the  Prophet  Muhammad,\npeace  be  upon  him,  are  alive  and\nwell here in Afghanistan, our beloved\nhomeland.  We  listen  to  what  God\nsays  and  we  obey  because  we  are\nnothing  but  humble,  powerless\ncreatures  before  God's  greatness.\nAnd what does God say? I \nask  you!  WHAT  DOES  GOD  SAY?\nGod  says  that  every  sinner  must  be\npunished  in  a  manner  befitting  his\nsin. Those are not my words, nor the\nwords  of  my  brothers.  Those  are  the\nwords  of  GOD!\"  He  pointed  with  his\nfree  hand  to  the  sky.  My  head  was\npounding  and  the  sun  felt  much  too", "hot.<br><br> \"Every sinner must be punished in a\nmanner  befitting  his  sin!\"  the  cleric\nrepeated  into  the  mike,  lowering  his\nvoice,  enunciating  each  word  slowly,\ndramatically.  \"And  what  manner  of\npunishment,  brothers  and  sisters,\nbefits  the  adulterer?  How  shall  we\npunish  those  who  dishonor  the\nsanctity  of  marriage?  How  shall  we\ndeal with those who spit in the face of\nGod?  How  shall  we  answer  those\nwho  throw  stones  at  the  windows  of\nGod's  house?  WE  SHALL  THROW\nTHE STONES BACK!\"<br><br>   He  shut  off  the  microphone.  A\nlow-pitched  murmur  spread  through\nthe crowd.<br><br>   Next  to  me,  Farid  was  shaking  his\nhead.  \"And  they  call  themselves\nMuslims,\" he whispered.<br><br>   Then  a  tall,  broad-shouldered  man\nstepped  out  of  the  pickup  truck.  The", "sight  of  him  drew  cheers  from  a  few\nspectators.  This  time,  no  one  was\nstruck  with  a  whip  for  cheering  too\nloudly. The tall man's sparkling white\ngarment  glimmered  in  the  afternoon\nsun.  The  hem  of  his  loose  shirt\nfluttered  in  the  breeze,  his  arms\nspread  like  those  of  Jesus  on  the\ncross.  He  greeted  the  crowd  by\nturning  slowly  in  a  full  circle.  When\nhe  faced  our  section,  I  saw  he  was\nwearing  dark  round  sunglasses  like\nthe ones John Lennon wore.<br><br> \"That must be our man,\" Farid said.<br><br>   The  tall  Talib  with  the  black\nsunglasses  walked  to  the  pile  of\nstones  they  had  unloaded  from  the\nthird  truck.  He  picked  up  a  rock  and\nshowed  it  to  the  crowd.  The  noise\nfell, replaced by a buzzing sound that\nrippled  through  the  stadium.  I  looked\naround  me  and  saw  that  everyone\nwas  tsk'ing.  The  Talib,  looking\nabsurdly  like  a  baseball  pitcher  on\nthe  mound,  hurled  the  stone  at  the", "blindfolded  man  in  the  hole.  It  struck\nthe  side  of  his  head.  The  woman\nscreamed  again.  The  crowd  made  a\nstartled  \"OH!\"  sound.  I  closed  my\neyes  and  covered  my  face  with  my\nhands. The spectators' \"OH!\" rhymed\nwith  each  flinging  of  the  stone,  and\nthat  went  on  for  a  while.  When  they\nstopped, I asked Farid if it was over.\nHe  said  no.  I  guessed  the  people's\nthroats  had  tired.  I  don't  know  how\nmuch longer I sat with my face in my\nhands.  I  know  that  I  reopened  my\neyes when I heard people around me\nasking, \"Mord? Mord? Is he dead?\"<br><br>     The  man  in  the  hole  was  now  a\nmangled  mess  of  blood  and\nshredded  rags.  His  head  slumped\nforward,  chin  on  chest.  The  Talib  in\nthe  John  Lennon  sunglasses  was\nlooking  down  at  another  man\nsquatting  next  to  the  hole,  tossing  a\nrock  up  and  down  in  his  hand.  The\nsquatting  man  had  one  end  of  a\nstethoscope to his ears and the other\npressed  on  the  chest  of  the  man  in\nthe  hole.  He  removed  the", "stethoscope from his ears and shook\nhis  head  no  at  the  Talib  in  the\nsunglasses. The crowd moaned.<br><br>   John  Lennon  walked  back  to  the\nmound.<br><br>   When  it  was  all  over,  when  the\nbloodied  corpses  had  been\nunceremoniously  tossed  into  the\nbacks  of  red  pickup  trucks--separate\nones--a  few  men  with  shovels\nhurriedly filled the holes. One of them\nmade  a  passing  attempt  at  covering\nup  the  large  blood  stains  by  kicking\ndirt  over  them.  A  few  minutes  later,\nthe teams took the field. Second half\nwas under way.<br><br> Our meeting was arranged for three\no'clock  that  afternoon.  The  swiftness\nwith  which  the  appointment  was  set\nsurprised  me.  I'd  expected  delays,  a\nround  of  questioning  at  least,\nperhaps a check of our papers. But I\nwas  reminded  of  how  unofficial  even\nofficial  matters  still  were  in", "Afghanistan:  all  Farid  had  to  do  was\ntell  one  of  the  whip-carrying  Talibs\nthat  we  had  personal  business  to\ndiscuss  with  the  man  in  white.  Farid\nand  he  exchanged  words.  The  guy\nwith  the  whip  then  nodded  and\nshouted  something  in  Pashtu  to  a\nyoung  man  on  the  field,  who  ran  to\nthe  south-end  goalposts  where  the\nTalib  in  the  sunglasses  was  chatting\nwith the plump cleric who'd given the\nsermon.  The  three  spoke.  I  saw  the\nguy  in  the  sunglasses  look  up.  He\nnodded.  Said  something  in  the\nmessenger's  ear.

I  rang  the  bell  but  no  buzz\ncame--still no electricity--and I had to\npound on the doors. A moment later,\nI  heard  terse  voices  from  the  other\nside  and  a  pair  of  men  toting\nKalashnikovs answered the door.<br><br>   I  glanced  at  Farid  sitting  in  the  car\nand mouthed, I'll be back, not so sure", "at all that I would be.<br><br> The armed men frisked me head to\ntoe,  patted  my  legs,  felt  my  crotch.\nOne  of  them  said  something  in\nPashtu  and  they  both  chuckled.  We\nstepped  through  the  front  gates.  The\ntwo  guards  escorted  me  across  a\nwell-manicured  lawn,  past  a  row  of\ngeraniums  and  stubby  bushes  lined\nalong  the  wall.  An  old  hand-pump\nwater well stood at the far end of the\nyard.  I  remembered  how  Kaka\nHomayoun's  house  in  Jalalabad  had\nhad  a  water  well  like  that--the  twins,\nFazila  and  Karima,  and  I  used  to\ndrop pebbles in it, listen for the plink.<br><br>   We  climbed  a  few  steps  and\nentered  a  large,  sparsely  decorated\nhouse. We crossed the foyer--a large\nAfghan  flag  draped  one  of  the\nwalls--and  the  men  took  me  upstairs\nto a room with twin mint green sofas\nand a big-screen TV in the far corner.\nA  prayer  rug  showing  a  slightly\noblong  Mecca  was  nailed  to  one  of", "the  walls.  The  older  of  the  two  men\nmotioned  toward  the  sofa  with  the\nbarrel  of  his  weapon.  I  sat  down.\nThey left the room.<br><br> I crossed my legs. Uncrossed them.\nSat  with  my  sweaty  hands  on  my\nknees.  Did  that  make  me  look\nnervous?  I  clasped  them  together,\ndecided  that  was  worse  and  just\ncrossed my arms on my chest. Blood\nthudded  in  my  temples.  I  felt  utterly\nalone.  Thoughts  were  flying  around\nin my head, but I didn't want to think\nat  all,  because  a  sober  part  of  me\nknew that what I had managed to get\nmyself  into  was  insanity.  I  was\nthousands  of  miles  from  my  wife,\nsitting  in  a  room  that  felt  like  a\nholding  cell,  waiting  for  a  man  I  had\nseen  murder  two  people  that  same\nday. It was insanity. Worse yet, it was\nirresponsible.  There  was  a  very\nrealistic  chance  that  I  was  going  to\nrender  Soraya  a  biwa,  a  widow,  at\nthe  age  of  thirty-six.  This  isn't  you,\nAmir, part of me said. You're gutless.", "It's  how  you  were  made.  And  that's\nnot  such  a  bad  thing  because  your\nsaving grace is that you've never lied\nto  yourself  about  it.  Not  about  that.\nNothing  wrong  with  cowardice  as\nlong  as  it  comes  with  prudence.  But\nwhen  a  coward  stops  remembering\nwho he is... God help him.<br><br>   There  was  a  coffee  table  by  the\nsofa.  The  base  was  X-shaped,\nwalnut-sized brass balls studding the\nring  where  the  metallic  legs  crossed.\nI'd  seen  a  table  like  that  before.\nWhere?  And  then  it  came  to  me:  at\nthe  crowded  tea  shop  in  Peshawar,\nthat night I'd gone for a walk. On the\ntable  sat  a  bowl  of  red  grapes.  I\nplucked  one  and  tossed  it  in  my\nmouth.  I  had  to  preoccupy  myself\nwith  something,  anything,  to  silence\nthe voice in my head. The grape was\nsweet.  I  popped  another  one  in,\nunaware  that  it  would  be  the  last  bit\nof  solid  food  I  would  eat  for  a  long\ntime. ", "    The  door  opened  and  the  two\narmed  men  returned,  between  them\nthe tall Talib in white, still wearing his\ndark  John  Lennon  glasses,  looking\nlike  some  broad-shouldered,\nNewAge mystic guru.<br><br> He took a seat across from me and\nlowered  his  hands  on  the  armrests.\nFor a long time, he said nothing. Just\nsat  there,  watching  me,  one  hand\ndrumming  the  upholstery,  the  other\ntwirling  turquoise  blue  prayer  beads.\nHe  wore  a  black  vest  over  the  white\nshirt  now,  and  a  gold  watch.  I  saw  a\nsplotch  of  dried  blood  on  his  left\nsleeve. I found it morbidly fascinating\nthat  he  hadn't  changed  clothes  after\nthe executions earlier that day. <br><br>   Periodically,  his  free  hand  floated\nup  and  his  thick  fingers  batted  at\nsomething in the air. They made slow\nstroking  motions,  up  and  down,  side\nto  side,  as  if  he  were  caressing  an\ninvisible  pet.  One  of  his  sleeves\nretracted  and  I  saw  marks  on  his\nforearm--I'd  seen  those  same  tracks", "on  homeless  people  living  in  grimy\nalleys in San Francisco.<br><br>   His  skin  was  much  paler  than  the\nother two men's, almost sallow, and a\ncrop of tiny sweat beads gleamed on\nhis  forehead  just  below  the  edge  of\nhis  black  turban.  His  beard,\nchest-length  like  the  others,  was\nlighter in color too.<br><br> \"Salaam alaykum,\" he said.<br><br> \"Salaam.\"<br><br>   \"You  can  do  away  with  that  now,\nyou know,\" he said.<br><br> \"Pardon?\"<br><br>   He  turned  his  palm  to  one  of  the\narmed  men  and  motioned.  Rrrriiiip.\nSuddenly  my  cheeks  were  stinging\nand the guard was tossing my beard\nup  and  down  in  his  hand,  giggling.\nThe Talib grinned. \"One of the better\nones I've seen in a while. But it really", "is  so  much  better  this  way,  I  think.\nDon't  you?\"  He  twirled  his  fingers,\nsnapped  them,  fist  opening  and\nclosing.  \"So,  Inshallah,  you  enjoyed\nthe show today?\"<br><br>   \"Was  that  what  it  was?\"  I  said,\nrubbing  my  cheeks,  hoping  my  voice\ndidn't  betray  the  explosion  of  terror  I\nfelt inside.<br><br> \"Public justice is the greatest kind of\nshow, my brother. Drama. Suspense.\nAnd,  best  of  all,  education  en\nmasse.\" He snapped his fingers. The\nyounger  of  the  two  guards  lit  him  a\ncigarette.  The  Talib  laughed.\nMumbled  to  himself.  His  hands  were\nshaking  and  he  almost  dropped  the\ncigarette. \"But you want a real show,\nyou  should  have  been  with  me  in\nMazar. August 1998, that was.\"<br><br> \"I'm sorry?\" <br><br> \"We left them out for the dogs, you\nknow.\" ", "  I saw what he was getting at.<br><br> He stood up, paced around the sofa\nonce,  twice.  Sat  down  again.  He\nspoke rapidly. \"Door to door we went,\ncalling  for  the  men  and  the  boys.\nWe'd  shoot  them  right  there  in  front\nof  their  families.  Let  them  see.  Let\nthem  remember  who  they  were,\nwhere  they  belonged.\"  He  was\nalmost panting now. \"Sometimes, we\nbroke  down  their  doors  and  went\ninside  their  homes.  And...  I'd...  I'd\nsweep the barrel of my machine gun\naround  the  room  and  fire  and  fire\nuntil  the  smoke  blinded  me.\"  He\nleaned  toward  me,  like  a  man  about\nto  share  a  great  secret.  \"You  don't\nknow  the  meaning  of  the  word\n'liberating'  until  you've  done  that,\nstood  in  a  roomful  of  targets,  let  the\nbullets  fly,  free  of  guilt  and  remorse,\nknowing  you  are  virtuous,  good,  and\ndecent.  Knowing  you're  doing  God's\nwork.  It's  breathtaking.\"  He  kissed\nthe  prayer  beads,  tilted  his  head.\n\"You remember that, Javid?\" ", "    \"Yes,  Agha  sahib,\"  the  younger  of\nthe  guards  replied.  \"How  could  I\nforget?\"<br><br>   I  had  read  about  the  Hazara\nmassacre  in  Mazar-i-Sharif  in  the\npapers. It had happened just after the\nTaliban  took  over  Mazar,  one  of  the\nlast  cities  to  fall.  I  remembered\nSoraya  handing  me  the  article  over\nbreakfast, her face bloodless.<br><br>   \"Door-to-door.  We  only  rested  for\nfood  and  prayer,\"  the  Talib  said.  He\nsaid  it  fondly,  like  a  man  telling  of  a\ngreat  party  he'd  attended.  \"We  left\nthe  bodies  in  the  streets,  and  if  their\nfamilies  tried  to  sneak  out  to  drag\nthem  back  into  their  homes,  we'd\nshoot  them  too.  We  left  them  in  the\nstreets for days. We left them for the\ndogs.  Dog  meat  for  dogs.\"  He\ncrushed  his  cigarette.  Rubbed  his\neyes  with  tremulous  hands.  \"You\ncome from America?\" ", "  \"Yes.\"<br><br> \"How is that whore these days?\"<br><br>   I  had  a  sudden  urge  to  urinate.  I\nprayed it would pass. \"I'm looking for\na boy.\" <br><br> \"Isn't everyone?\" he said. The men\nwith the Kalashnikovs laughed. Their\nteeth  were  stained  green  with\nnaswar.<br><br> \"I understand he is here, with you,\" I\nsaid. \"His name is Sohrab.\"<br><br>   \"I'll  ask  you  something:  What  are\nyou  doing  with  that  whore?  Why\naren't  you  here,  with  your  Muslim\nbrothers, serving your country?\"<br><br>   \"I've  been  away  a  long  time,\"  was\nall  I  could  think  of  saying.  My  head\nfelt  so  hot.  I  pressed  my  knees\ntogether, held my bladder.<br><br>   The  Talib  turned  to  the  two  men\nstanding  by  the  door.  \"That's  an", "answer?\" he asked them.<br><br>   \"Nay,  Agha  sahib,\"  they  said  in\nunison, smiling.<br><br>   He  turned  his  eyes  to  me.\nShrugged. \"Not an answer, they say.\"\nHe  took  a  drag  of  his  cigarette.\n\"There  are  those  in  my  circle  who\nbelieve  that  abandoning  watan  when\nit needs you the most is the same as\ntreason. I could have you arrested for\ntreason,  have  you  shot  for  it  even.\nDoes that frighten you?\"<br><br> \"I'm only here for the boy.\"<br><br> \"Does that frighten you?\"<br><br> \"Yes.\"<br><br> \"It should,\" he said. He leaned back\nin the sofa. Crushed the cigarette.<br><br>   I  thought  about  Soraya.  It  calmed\nme.  I  thought  of  her  sickle-shaped\nbirthmark,  the  elegant  curve  of  her", "neck, her luminous eyes. I thought of\nour  wedding  night,  gazing  at  each\nother's  reflection  in  the  mirror  under\nthe  green  veil,  and  how  her  cheeks\nblushed  when  I  whispered  that  I\nloved her. I \nremembered the two of us dancing to\nan  old  Afghan  song,  round  and\nround,  everyone  watching  and\nclapping,  the  world  a  blur  of  flowers,\ndresses, tuxedos, and smiling faces.<br><br> The Talib was saying something.<br><br> \"Pardon?\"<br><br>   \"I  said  would  you  like  to  see  him?\nWould  you  like  to  see  my  boy?\"  His\nupper  lip  curled  up  in  a  sneer  when\nhe said those last two words.<br><br> \"Yes.\"<br><br> The guard left the room. I heard the\ncreak of a door swinging open. Heard\nthe  guard  say  something  in  Pashtu,\nin  a  hard  voice.  Then,  footfalls,  and", "the  jingle  of  bells  with  each  step.  It\nreminded  me  of  the  Monkey  Man\nHassan and I used to chase down in\nShar  e-Nau.  We  used  to  pay  him  a\nrupia  of  our  allowance  for  a  dance.\nThe  bell  around  his  monkey's  neck\nhad made that same jingling sound.<br><br>   Then  the  door  opened  and  the\nguard  walked  in.  He  carried  a\nstereo--a boom box--on his shoulder.\nBehind  him,  a  boy  dressed  in  a\nloose,  sapphire  blue  pirhan-tumban\nfollowed.<br><br> The resemblance was breathtaking.\nDisorienting.  Rahim  Khan's  Polaroid\nhadn't done justice to it.<br><br>   The  boy  had  his  father's  round\nmoon  face,  his  pointy  stub  of  a  chin,\nhis  twisted,  seashell  ears,  and  the\nsame  slight  frame.  It  was  the\nChinese  doll  face  of  my  childhood,\nthe  face  peering  above  fanned-out\nplaying  cards  all  those  winter  days,\nthe  face  behind  the  mosquito  net", "when  we  slept  on  the  roof  of  my\nfather's  house  in  the  summer.  His\nhead was shaved, his eyes darkened\nwith mascara, and his cheeks glowed\nwith  an  unnatural  red.  When  he\nstopped  in  the  middle  of  the  room,\nthe bells strapped around his anklets\nstopped jingling. His eyes fell on me.\nLingered.  Then  he  looked  away.\nLooked down at his naked feet. <br><br> One of the guards pressed a button\nand  Pashtu  music  filled  the  room.\nTabla,  harmonium,  the  whine  of  a\ndil-roba.  I  guessed  music  wasn't\nsinful  as  long  as  it  played  to  Taliban\nears. The three men began to clap.<br><br>   \"Wah  wah!  Mashallah!\"  they\ncheered.<br><br>   Sohrab  raised  his  arms  and  turned\nslowly.  He  stood  on  tiptoes,  spun\ngracefully,  dipped  to  his  knees,\nstraightened,  and  spun  again.  His\nlittle hands swiveled at the wrists, his\nfingers snapped, and his head swung\nside to side like a pendulum. His feet", "pounded the floor, the bells jingling in\nperfect  harmony  with  the  beat  of  the\ntabla. He kept his eyes closed.<br><br>   \"Mashallah!\"  they  cheered.\n\"Shahbas!  Bravo!\"  The  two  guards\nwhistled  and  laughed.  The  Talib  in\nwhite  was  tilting  his  head  back  and\nforth  with  the  music,  his  mouth\nhalf-open in a leer.<br><br>   Sohrab  danced  in  a  circle,  eyes\nclosed,  danced  until  the  music\nstopped.  The  bells  jingled  one  final\ntime  when  he  stomped  his  foot  with\nthe  song's  last  note.  He  froze  in\nmidspin.<br><br>   \"Bia,  bia,  my  boy,\"  the  Talib  said,\ncalling Sohrab to him. Sohrab went to\nhim,  head  down,  stood  between  his\nthighs.  The  Talib  wrapped  his  arms\naround  the  boy.  \"How  talented  he  is,\nnay,  my  Hazara  boy!\"  he  said.  His\nhands  slid  down  the  child's  back,\nthen  up,  felt  under  his  armpits.  One\nof  the  guards  elbowed  the  other  and", "snickered.  The  Talib  told  them  to\nleave us alone.<br><br> \"Yes, Agha sahib,\" they said as they\nexited.<br><br>   The  Talib  spun  the  boy  around  so\nhe  faced  me.  He  locked  his  arms\naround Sohrab's belly, rested his chin\non the boy's shoulder. Sohrab looked\ndown  at  his  feet,  but  kept  stealing\nshy, furtive glances at me. The man's\nhand  slid  up  and  down  the  boy's\nbelly. Up and down, slowly, gently.<br><br>   \"I've  been  wondering,\"  the  Talib\nsaid,  his  bloodshot  eyes  peering  at\nme  over  Sohrab's  shoulder.\n\"Whatever  happened  to  old  Babalu,\nanyway?\" <br><br>   The  question  hit  me  like  a  hammer\nbetween  the  eyes.  I  felt  the  color\ndrain  from  my  face.  My  legs  went\ncold. Numb.<br><br>   He  laughed.  \"What  did  you  think?\nThat you'd put on a fake beard and I", "wouldn't  recognize  you?  Here's\nsomething  I'll  bet  you  never  knew\nabout  me:  I  never  forget  a  face.  Not\never.\"  He  brushed  his  lips  against\nSohrab's  ear,  kept  his  eye  on  me.  \"I\nheard  your  father  died.  Tsk-tsk.  I\nalways  did  want  to  take  him  on.\nLooks  like  I'll  have  to  settle  for  his\nweakling  of  a  son.\"  Then  he  took  off\nhis  sunglasses  and  locked  his\nbloodshot blue eyes on mine.<br><br> I tried to take a breath and couldn't.\nI  tried  to  blink  and  couldn't.  The\nmoment  felt  surreal--no,  not  surreal,\nabsurd--it had knocked the breath out\nof  me,  brought  the  world  around  me\nto  a  standstill.  My  face  was  burning.\nWhat  was  the  old  saying  about  the\nbad  penny?  My  past  was  like  that,\nalways  turning  up.  His  name  rose\nfrom the deep and I didn't want to say\nit,  as  if  uttering  it  might  conjure  him.\nBut he was already here, in the flesh,\nsitting  less  than  ten  feet  from  me,\nafter  all  these  years.  His  name\nescaped my lips: \"Assef.\" ", "  \"Amir jan.\"<br><br>   \"What  are  you  doing  here?\"  I  said,\nknowing  how  utterly  foolish  the\nquestion sounded, yet unable to think\nof anything else to say.<br><br>   \"Me?\"  Assef  arched  an  eyebrow\n\"I'm  in  my  element.  The  question  is\nwhat are you doing here?\"<br><br> \"I already told you,\" I said. My voice\nwas trembling. I wished it wouldn't do\nthat,  wished  my  flesh  wasn't\nshrinking against my bones.<br><br> \"The boy?\"<br><br> \"Yes.\"<br><br> \"Why?\" <br><br>   \"I'll  pay  you  for  him,\"  I  said.  \"I  can\nhave money wired.\"<br><br>   \"Money?\"  Assef  said.  He  tittered.\n\"Have  you  ever  heard  of", "Rockingham?  Western  Australia,  a\nslice  of  heaven.  You  should  see  it,\nmiles  and  miles  of  beach.  Green\nwater,  blue  skies.  My  parents  live\nthere, in a beachfront villa. There's a\ngolf  course  behind  the  villa  and  a\nlittle  lake.  Father  plays  golf  every\nday.  Mother,  she  prefers\ntennis--Father says she has a wicked\nbackhand.  They  own  an  Afghan\nrestaurant  and  two  jewelry  stores;\nboth  businesses  are  doing\nspectacularly.\"  He  plucked  a  red\ngrape.  Put  it,  lovingly,  in  Sohrab's\nmouth.  \"So  if  I  need  money,  I'll  have\nthem  wire  it  to  me.\"  He  kissed  the\nside  of  Sohrab's  neck.  The  boy\nflinched  a  little,  closed  his  eyes\nagain.  \"Besides,  I  didn't  fight  the\nShorawi  for  money.  Didn't  join  the\nTaliban  for  money  either.  Do  you\nwant to know why I joined them?\"<br><br> My lips had gone dry. I licked them\nand found my tongue had dried too.<br><br>   \"Are  you  thirsty?\"  Assef  said,", "smirking.<br><br> \"I think you're thirsty.\"<br><br> \"I'm fine,\" I said. The truth was, the\nroom  felt  too  hot  suddenly--sweat\nwas bursting from my pores, prickling\nmy  skin.  And  was  this  really\nhappening?  Was  I  really  sitting\nacross from Assef? \"As you wish,\" he\nsaid. \"Anyway, where was I? Oh yes,\nhow I joined the Taliban. Well, as you\nmay  remember,  I  wasn't  much  of  a\nreligious  type.  But  one  day  I  had  an\nepiphany. I had it in jail. Do you want\nto hear?\"<br><br> I said nothing.<br><br> \"Good. I'll tell you,\" he said. \"I spent\nsome time in jail, at Poleh-Charkhi**,\njust after Babrak Karmal took over in\n1980.  I  ended  up  there  one  night,\nwhen  a  group  of  Parchami  soldiers\nmarched  into  our  house  and  ordered\nmy  father  and  me  at  gun  point  to\nfollow them. The bastards didn't give", "a  reason,  and  they  wouldn't  answer\nmy  mother's  questions.  Not  that  it\nwas  a  mystery;  everyone  knew  the\ncommunists  had  no  class.  They\ncame  from  poor  families  with  no\nname. The same dogs who weren't fit\nto  lick  my  shoes  before  the  Shorawi\ncame  were  now  ordering  me  at\ngunpoint,  Parchami  flag  on  their\nlapels,  making  their  little  point  about\nthe  fall  of  the  bourgeoisie  and  acting\nlike  they  were  the  ones  with  class.  It\nwas  happening  all  over:  Round  up\nthe  rich,  throw  them  in  jail,  make  an\nexample for the comrades.<br><br>     \"Anyway,  we  were  crammed  in\ngroups of six in these tiny cells each\nthe size of a refrigerator. Every night\nthe  commandant,  a  half-Hazara,\nhalf-Uzbek  thing  who  smelled  like  a\nrotting donkey, would have one of the\nprisoners dragged out of the cell and\nhe'd beat him until sweat poured from\nhis  fat  face.  Then  he'd  light  a\ncigarette,  crack  his  joints,  and  leave.\nThe  next  night,  he'd  pick  someone\nelse.  One  night,  he  picked  me.  It", "couldn't  have  come  at  a  worse  time.\nI'd been peeing blood for three days.\nKidney  stones.  And  if  you've  never\nhad  one,  believe  me  when  I  say  it's\nthe worst imaginable pain. My mother\nused  to  get  them  too,  and  I\nremember  she  told  me  once  she'd\nrather  give  birth  than  pass  a  kidney\nstone.  Anyway,  what  could  I  do?\nThey dragged me out and he started\nkicking  me.  He  had  knee-high  boots\nwith  steel  toes  that  he  wore  every\nnight  for  his  little  kicking  game,  and\nhe  used  them  on  me.  I  was\nscreaming  and  screaming  and  he\nkept  kicking  me  and  then,  suddenly,\nhe  kicked  me  on  the  left  kidney  and\nthe  stone  passed.  Just  like  that!  Oh,\nthe  relief!\"  Assef  laughed.  \"And  I\nyelled  'Allah-u  akbar'  and  he  kicked\nme  even  harder  and  I  started\nlaughing.  He  got  mad  and  hit  me\nharder, and the harder he kicked me,\nthe harder I laughed. They threw me\nback  in  the  cell  laughing.  I  kept\nlaughing  and  laughing  because\nsuddenly  I  knew  that  had  been  a", "message  from  God:  He  was  on  my\nside.  He  wanted  me  to  live  for  a\nreason.<br><br>   \"You  know,  I  ran  into  that\ncommandant  on  the  battlefield  a  few\nyears  later--funny  how  God  works.  I\nfound  him  in  a  trench  just  outside\nMeymanah,  bleeding  from  a  piece  of\nshrapnel  in  his  chest.  He  was  still\nwearing  those  same  boots.  I  asked\nhim  if  he  remembered  me.  He  said\nno.  I  told  him  the  same  thing  I  just\ntold  you,  that  I  never  forget  a  face.\nThen I shot him in the balls. I've been\non a mission since.\"<br><br>   \"What  mission  is  that?\"  I  heard\nmyself  say.  \"Stoning  adulterers?\nRaping children? Flogging women for\nwearing  high  heels?

Taking\nout the garbage?\"<br><br> \"Precisely.\"<br><br>   \"In  the  west,  they  have  an\nexpression for that,\" I said. \"They call", "it ethnic cleansing.\"<br><br> \"Do they?\" Assef's face brightened.\n\"Ethnic  cleansing.  I  like  it.  I  like  the\nsound of it.\"<br><br> \"All I want is the boy.\"<br><br>   \"Ethnic  cleansing,\"  Assef\nmurmured, tasting the words.<br><br>   \"I  want  the  boy,\"  I  said  again.\nSohrab's  eyes  flicked  to  me.  They\nwere  slaughter  sheep's  eyes.  They\neven  had  the  mascara--I\nremembered  how,  on  the  day  of  Eid\nof  Qorban,  the  mullah  in  our\nbackyard  used  to  apply  mascara  to\nthe  eyes  of  the  sheep  and  feed  it  a\ncube of sugar before slicing its throat.\nI  thought  I  saw  pleading  in  Sohrab's\neyes.<br><br>   \"Tell  me  why,\"  Assef  said.  He\npinched  Sohrab's  earlobe  between\nhis teeth. Let go. Sweat beads rolled\ndown his brow. ", "  \"That's my business.\"<br><br> \"What do you want to do with him?\"\nhe  said.  Then  a  coy  smile.  \"Or  to\nhim.\" <br><br> \"That's disgusting,\" I said.<br><br>   \"How  would  you  know?  Have  you\ntried it?\"<br><br>   \"I  want  to  take  him  to  a  better\nplace.\"<br><br> \"Tell me why.\"<br><br> \"That's my business,\" I said. I didn't\nknow what had emboldened me to be\nso curt, maybe the fact that I thought\nI was going to die anyway.<br><br>   \"I  wonder,\"  Assef  said.  \"I  wonder\nwhy  you've  come  all  this  way,  Amir,\ncome all this way for a Hazara? Why\nare  you  here?  Why  are  you  really\nhere?\" ", "  \"I have my reasons,\" I said.<br><br>   \"Very  well  then,\"  Assef  said,\nsneering.  He  shoved  Sohrab  in  the\nback, pushed him right into the table.\nSohrab's  hips  struck  the  table,\nknocking  it  upside  down  and  spilling\nthe grapes. He fell on them, face first,\nand  stained  his  shirt  purple  with\ngrape  juice.  The  table's  legs,\ncrossing  through  the  ring  of  brass\nballs,  were  now  pointing  to  the\nceiling.<br><br>   \"Take  him,  then,\"  Assef  said.  I\nhelped  Sohrab  to  his  feet,  swatted\nthe  bits  of  crushed  grape  that  had\nstuck to his pants like barnacles to a\npier.<br><br> \"Go, take him,\" Assef said, pointing\nto the door.<br><br>   I  took  Sohrab's  hand.  It  was  small,\nthe  skin  dry  and  calloused.  His\nfingers moved, laced themselves with\nmine.  I  saw  Sohrab  in  that  Polaroid", "again, the way his arm was wrapped\naround  Hassan's  leg,  his  head\nresting  against  his  father's  hip.\nThey'd  both  been  smiling.  The  bells\njingled as we crossed the room.<br><br> We made it as far as the door.<br><br>  \"Of course,\" Assef said behind us,\n\"I  didn't  say  you  could  take  him  for\nfree.\"<br><br> I turned. \"What do you want?\"<br><br> \"You have to earn him.\"<br><br> \"What do you want?\"<br><br>   \"We  have  some  unfinished\nbusiness,  you  and  I,\"  Assef  said.\n\"You remember, don't you?\"<br><br>   He  needn't  have  worried.  I  would\nnever  forget  the  day  after  Daoud\nKhan  overthrew  the  king.  My  entire\nadult  life,  whenever  I  heard  Daoud\nKhan's  name,  what  I  saw  was\nHassan with his sling shot pointed at", "Assef's  face,  Hassan  saying  that\nthey'd  have  to  start  calling  him\nOne-Eyed  Assef,  instead  of  Assef\nGoshkhor.  I  remember  how  envious\nI'd  been  of  Hassan's  bravery.  Assef\nhad  backed  down,  promised  that  in\nthe  end  he'd  get  us  both.  He'd  kept\nthat promise with Hassan. Now it was\nmy turn.<br><br>   \"All  right,\"  I  said,  not  knowing  what\nelse there was to say. I wasn't about\nto  beg;  that  would  have  only\nsweetened the moment for him.<br><br>   Assef  called  the  guards  back  into\nthe room. \"I want you to listen to me,\"\nhe  said  to  them.  \"In  a  moment,  I'm\ngoing to close the door. Then he and\nI  are  going  to  finish  an  old  bit  of\nbusiness.  No  matter  what  you  hear,\ndon't  come  in!  Do  you  hear  me?\nDon't come in.<br><br>   The  guards  nodded.  Looked  from\nAssef to me. \"Yes, Agha sahib.\" ", "    \"When  it's  all  done,  only  one  of  us\nwill walk out of this room alive,\" Assef\nsaid. \"If it's him, then he's earned his\nfreedom  and  you  let  him  pass,  do\nyou understand?\" <br><br> The older guard shifted on his feet.\n\"But Agha sahib--\" <br><br> \"If it's him, you let him pass!\" Assef\nscreamed.  The  two  men  flinched  but\nnodded  again.  They  turned  to  go.\nOne of them reached for Sohrab.<br><br>   \"Let  him  stay,\"  Assef  said.  He\ngrinned. \"Let him watch. Lessons are\ngood things for boys.\"<br><br> The guards left. Assef put down his\nprayer  beads.  Reached  in  the  breast\npocket  of  his  black  vest.

My\neyes keep going to his Adam's apple\nbobbing up and down, up and down,\nand  I  want  to  ask  him  how  old  he  is\nanyway--he  looks  far  too  young,  like\nan  actor  from  some  foreign  soap\nopera--but all I can mutter is, I think I\ngave  him  a  good  fight.  I  think  I  gave\nhim a good fight.<br><br>\nI  DON'T  KNOW  if  I  gave  Assef  a\ngood  fight.  I  don't  think  I  did.  How\ncould I have? That was the first time\nI'd  fought  anyone.  I  had  never  so\nmuch as thrown a punch in my entire\nlife. ", "  My memory of the fight with Assef is\namazingly  vivid  in  stretches:  I\nremember Assef turning on the music\nbefore slipping on his brass knuckles.\nThe  prayer  rug,  the  one  with  the\noblong,  woven  Mecca,  came  loose\nfrom the wall at one point and landed\non  my  head;  the  dust  from  it  made\nme  sneeze.  I  remember  Assef\nshoving  grapes  in  my  face,  his  snarl\nall  spit-shining  teeth,  his  bloodshot\neyes  rolling.  His  turban  fell  at  some\npoint,  let  loose  curls  of\nshoulder-length blond hair. <br><br>   And  the  end,  of  course.  That,  I  still\nsee with perfect clarity. I always will.<br><br>   Mostly,  I  remember  this:  His  brass\nknuckles  flashing  in  the  afternoon\nlight;  how  cold  they  felt  with  the  first\nfew  blows  and  how  quickly  they\nwarmed  with  my  blood.  Getting\nthrown against the wall, a nail where\na  framed  picture  may  have  hung\nonce  jabbing  at  my  back.  Sohrab\nscreaming.  Tabla,  harmonium,  a\ndil-roba.  Getting  hurled  against  the", "wall. The knuckles shattering my jaw.\nChoking  on  my  own  teeth,\nswallowing  them,  thinking  about  all\nthe countless hours I'd spent flossing\nand  brushing.  Getting  hurled  against\nthe  wall.  Lying  on  the  floor,  blood\nfrom  my  split  upper  lip  staining  the\nmauve  carpet,  pain  ripping  through\nmy belly, and wondering when I'd be\nable  to  breathe  again.  The  sound  of\nmy  ribs  snapping  like  the  tree\nbranches Hassan and I used to break\nto sword fight like Sinbad in those old\nmovies.  Sohrab  screaming.

Biting  down  in  pain,  noticing\nhow  my  teeth  didn't  align  like  they\nused  to.  Getting  kicked.  Sohrab\nscreaming.

And the\nharder  I  laughed,  the  harder  he\nkicked  me,  punched  me,  scratched\nme.<br><br>   \"WHAT'S  SO  FUNNY?\"  Assef  kept\nroaring  with  each  blow.  His  spittle\nlanded in my eye. Sohrab screamed.<br><br>   \"WHAT'S  SO  FUNNY?\"  Assef\nbellowed.  Another  rib  snapped,  this\ntime  left  lower.  What  was  so  funny\nwas  that,  for  the  first  time  since  the\nwinter  of  1975,  I  felt  at  peace.  I\nlaughed because I saw that, in some\nhidden  nook  in  a  corner  of  my  mind,\nI'd even been looking forward to this.\nI  remembered  the  day  on  the  hill  I\nhad  pelted  Hassan  with\npomegranates  and  tried  to  provoke\nhim.  He'd  just  stood  there,  doing\nnothing, red juice soaking through his\nshirt  like  blood.  Then  he'd  taken  the\npomegranate from my hand, crushed", "it  against  his  forehead.  Are  you\nsatisfied  now?  he'd  hissed.  Do  you\nfeel better? I hadn't been happy and I\nhadn't  felt  better,  not  at  all.  But  I  did\nnow.  My  body  was  broken--just  how\nbadly  I  wouldn't  find  out  until\nlater--but I felt healed. Healed at last.\nI laughed.<br><br>   Then  the  end.  That,  I'll  take  to  my\ngrave: I was on the ground laughing,\nAssef straddling my chest, his face a\nmask  of  lunacy,  framed  by  snarls  of\nhis hair swaying inches from my face.\nHis free hand was locked around my\nthroat.  The  other,  the  one  with  the\nbrass  knuckles,  cocked  above  his\nshoulder.  He  raised  his  fist  higher,\nraised it for another blow.<br><br>  Then: \"Bas.\" A thin voice.<br><br> We both looked.<br><br> \"Please, no more.\"<br><br>   I  remembered  something  the\norphanage  director  had  said  when", "he'd  opened  the  door  to  me  and\nFarid.

He  tucks  it  in  the\nwaist  of  his  pants  everywhere  he\ngoes.<br><br> \"No more.\"<br><br> Twin trails of black mascara, mixed\nwith  tears,  had  rolled  down  his\ncheeks,  smeared  the  rouge.  His\nlower  lip  trembled.  Mucus  seeped\nfrom his nose. \"Bas,\" he croaked.<br><br>   His  hand  was  cocked  above  his\nshoulder,  holding  the  cup  of  the\nslingshot  at  the  end  of  the  elastic\nband  which  was  pulled  all  the  way\nback.  There  was  something  in  the\ncup,  something  shiny  and  yellow.  I\nblinked  the  blood  from  my  eyes  and\nsaw  it  was  one  of  the  brass  balls\nfrom  the  ring  in  the  table  base.\nSohrab  had  the  slingshot  pointed  to\nAssef's face. ", "    \"No  more,  Agha.  Please,\"  he  said,\nhis  voice  husky  and  trembling.  \"Stop\nhurting him.\"<br><br>   Assef's  mouth  moved  wordlessly.\nHe began to say something, stopped.\n\"What  do  you  think  you're  you\ndoing?\" he finally said.<br><br>   \"Please  stop,\"  Sohrab  said,  fresh\ntears  pooling  in  his  green  eyes,\nmixing with mascara. <br><br> \"Put it down, Hazara,\" Assef hissed.\n\"Put it down or what I'm doing to him\nwill  be  a  gentle  ear  twisting\ncompared to what I'll do to you.\"<br><br> The tears broke free. Sohrab shook\nhis  head.  \"Please,  Agha,\"  he  said.\n\"Stop.\"<br><br> \"Put it down.\"<br><br> \"Don't hurt him anymore.\"<br><br> \"Put it down.\" ", "  \"Please.\"<br><br> \"PUT IT DOWN!\"<br><br> \"PUT IT DOWN!\" Assef let go of my\nthroat. Lunged at Sohrab.<br><br> The slingshot made a thwiiiiit sound\nwhen Sohrab released the cup. Then\nAssef  was  screaming.  He  put  his\nhand where his left eye had been just\na moment ago. Blood oozed between\nhis  fingers.  Blood  and  something\nelse,  something  white  and  gel-like.\nThat's  called  vitreous  fluid,  I  thought\nwith  clarity.  I've  read  that\nsomewhere. Vitreous fluid.<br><br>   Assef  rolled  on  the  carpet.  Rolled\nside  to  side,  shrieking,  his  hand  still\ncupped over the bloody socket.<br><br> \"Let's go!\" Sohrab said. He took my\nhand.  Helped  me  to  my  feet.  Every\ninch of my battered body wailed with\npain.  Behind  us,  Assef  kept\nshrieking. ", "  \"OUT! GET IT OUT!\" he screamed.<br><br>   Teetering,  I  opened  the  door.  The\nguards' eyes widened when they saw\nme  and  I  wondered  what  I  looked\nlike.  My  stomach  hurt  with  each\nbreath.  One  of  the  guards  said\nsomething  in  Pashtu  and  then  they\nblew  past  us,  running  into  the  room\nwhere  Assef  was  still  screaming.\n\"OUT!\"<br><br> \"Bia,\" Sohrab said, pulling my hand.\n\"Let's go!\"<br><br>   I  stumbled  down  the  hallway,\nSohrab's  little  hand  in  mine.  I  took  a\nfinal  look  over  my  shoulder.  The\nguards  were  huddled  over  Assef,\ndoing  something  to  his  face.  Then  I\nunderstood:  The  brass  ball  was  still\nstuck in his empty eye socket.<br><br>   The  whole  world  rocking  up  and\ndown,  swooping  side  to  side,  I\nhobbled  down  the  steps,  leaning  on", "Sohrab.  From  above,  Assef's\nscreams went on and on, the cries of\na  wounded  animal.  We  made  it\noutside, into daylight, my arm around\nSohrab's  shoulder,  and  I  saw  Farid\nrunning toward us.<br><br> \"Bismillah! Bismillah!\" he said, eyes\nbulging at the sight of me.<br><br>   He  slung  my  arm  around  his\nshoulder and lifted me. Carried me to\nthe truck, running. I think I screamed.\nI  watched  the  way  his  sandals\npounded  the  pavement,  slapped  his\nblack,  calloused  heels.  It  hurt  to\nbreathe.

But  as  I\nwatched  a  pigeon  peck  at  a  bread\ncrumb  on  the  windowsill,  I  kept\nthinking  of  something  else\nArmand/Dr.  Faruqi  had  said:  The\nimpact had cut your upper lip in two,\nhe  had  said,  clean  down  the  middle.\nClean  down  the  middle.  Like  a\nharelip.<br><br>\nFARID  AND  SOHRAB  came  to  visit\nthe  next  day.  \"Do  you  know  who  we\nare today? Do you remember?\" Farid\nsaid, only half-jokingly. I nodded.<br><br> \"Al hamdullellah!\" he said, beaming.\n\"No more talking nonsense.\"<br><br>   \"Thank  you,  Farid,\"  I  said  through\njaws  wired  shut.  Armand  was  right--I\ndid  sound  like  Al  Pacino  from  The\nGodfather.  And  my  tongue  surprised\nme  every  time  it  poked  in  one  of  the", "empty  spaces  left  by  the  teeth  I  had\nswallowed.  \"I  mean,  thank  you.  For\neverything.\"<br><br>   He  waved  a  hand,  blushed  a  little.\n\"Bas,  it's  not  worthy  of  thanks,\"  he\nsaid.  I  turned  to  Sohrab.  He  was\nwearing  a  new  outfit,  light  brown\npirhan-tumban  that  looked  a  bit  big\nfor him, and a black skullcap. He was\nlooking  down  at  his  feet,  toying  with\nthe IV line coiled on the bed.<br><br>   \"We  were  never  properly\nintroduced,\"  I  said.  I  offered  him  my\nhand. \"I am Amir.\"<br><br> He looked at my hand, then to me.\n\"You  are  the  Amir  agha  Father  told\nme about?\" he said.<br><br>   \"Yes.\"  I  remembered  the  words\nfrom  Hassan's  letter.  I  have  told\nmuch  about  you  to  Farzana  jan  and\nSohrab,  about  us  growing  up\ntogether  and  playing  games  and\nrunning  in  the  streets.  They  laugh  at", "the stories of all the mischief you and\nI  used  to  cause!  \"I  owe  you  thanks\ntoo,  Sohrab  jan,\"  I  said.  \"You  saved\nmy life.\" <br><br>   He  didn't  say  anything.  I  dropped\nmy hand when he didn't take it. \"I like\nyour new clothes,\" I mumbled.<br><br>   \"They're  my  son's,\"  Farid  said.  \"He\nhas  outgrown  them.  They  fit  Sohrab\npretty  well,  I  would  say.\"  Sohrab\ncould stay with him, he said, until we\nfound a place for him. \"We don't have\na  lot  of  room,  but  what  can  I  do?  I\ncan't  leave  him  to  the  streets.\nBesides,  my  children  have  taken  a\nliking  to  him.  Ha,  Sohrab?\"  But  the\nboy  just  kept  looking  down,  twirling\nthe line with his finger.<br><br>   \"I've  been  meaning  to  ask,\"  Farid\nsaid,  a  little  hesitantly.  \"What\nhappened  in  that  house?  What\nhappened  between  you  and  the\nTalib?\"<br><br> \"Let's just say we both got what we", "deserved,\" I said.<br><br>   Farid  nodded,  didn't  push  it.  It\noccurred  to  me  that  somewhere\nbetween  the  time  we  had  left\nPeshawar  for  Afghanistan  and  now,\nwe  had  become  friends.  \"I've  been\nmeaning to ask something too.\"<br><br> \"What?\"<br><br>   I  didn't  want  to  ask.  I  was  afraid  of\nthe answer. \"Rahim Khan,\" I said.<br><br> \"He's gone.\"<br><br> My heart skipped. \"Is he--\" <br><br> \"No, just... gone.\" He handed me a\nfolded  piece  of  paper  and  a  small\nkey. \"The landlord gave me this when\nI went looking for him. He said Rahim\nKhan left the day after we did.\"<br><br> \"Where did he go?\" <br><br> Farid shrugged. \"The landlord didn't\nknow  He  said  Rahim  Khan  left  the", "letter  and  the  key  for  you  and  took\nhis leave.\" He checked his watch. \"I'd\nbetter go. Bia, Sohrab.\"<br><br>   \"Could  you  leave  him  here  for  a\nwhile?\"  I  said.  \"Pick  him  up  later?\"  I\nturned  to  Sohrab.  \"Do  you  want  to\nstay here with me for a little while?\"<br><br> He shrugged and said nothing.<br><br> \"Of course,\" Farid said. \"I'll pick him\nup just before evening namaz.\"<br><br>\nTHERE  WERE  THREE  OTHER\nPATIENTS  in  my  room.  Two  older\nmen,  one  with  a  cast  on  his  leg,  the\nother  wheezing  with  asthma,  and  a\nyoung man of fifteen or sixteen who'd\nhad appendix surgery. The old guy in\nthe cast stared at us without blinking,\nhis  eyes  switching  from  me  to  the\nHazara  boy  sitting  on  a  stool.  My\nroommates'  families--old  women  in\nbright  shalwar-kameezes,  children,", "men  wearing  skullcaps--shuffled\nnoisily  in  and  out  of  the  room.  They\nbrought  with  them  pakoras,  naan,\nsa,nosas,  biryani.  Sometimes  people\njust  wandered  into  the  room,  like  the\ntall, bearded man who walked in just\nbefore  Farid  and  Sohrab  arrived.  He\nwore  a  brown  blanket  wrapped\naround  him.  Aisha  asked  him\nsomething  in  Urdu.  He  paid  her  no\nattention  and  scanned  the  room  with\nhis eyes. I thought he looked at me a\nlittle  longer  than  necessary.  When\nthe nurse spoke to him again, he just\nspun around and left.<br><br> \"How are you?\" I asked Sohrab. He\nshrugged, looked at his hands.<br><br>   \"Are  you  hungry?  That  lady  there\ngave me a plate of biryani, but I can't\neat it,\" I said. I didn't know what else\nto say to him. \"You want it?\"<br><br> He shook his head.<br><br> \"Do you want to talk?\"  ", "  He shook his head again.<br><br>   We  sat  there  like  that  for  a  while,\nsilent,  me  propped  up  in  bed,  two\npillows  behind  my  back,  Sohrab  on\nthe  three-legged  stool  next  to  the\nbed. I fell asleep at some point, and,\nwhen  I  woke  up,  daylight  had\ndimmed  a  bit,  the  shadows  had\nstretched, and Sohrab was still sitting\nnext to me. He was still looking down\nat his hands.<br><br>\nTHAT  NIGHT,  after  Farid  picked  up\nSohrab,  I  unfolded  Rahim  Khan's\nletter.  I  had  delayed  reading  it  as\nlong  as  possible.  It  read:  Amir  jan,\nInshallah,  you  have  reached  this\nletter safely. I pray that I have not put\nyou  in  harm's  way  and  that\nAfghanistan has not been too unkind\nto you. You have been in my prayers\nsince the day you left. You were right\nall  those  years  to  suspect  that  I\nknew.  I  did  know.  Hassan  told  me", "shortly  after  it  happened.  What  you\ndid  was  wrong,  Amir  jan,  but  do  not\nforget  that  you  were  a  boy  when  it\nhappened.  A  troubled  little  boy.  You\nwere  too  hard  on  yourself  then,  and\nyou  still  are--I  saw  it  in  your  eyes  in\nPeshawar.  But  I  hope  you  will  heed\nthis:  A  man  who  has  no  conscience,\nno goodness, does not suffer. I hope\nyour  suffering  comes  to  an  end  with\nthis journey to Afghanistan.<br><br> Amir jan, I am ashamed for the lies\nwe told you all those years. You were\nright  to  be  angry  in  Peshawar.  You\nhad a right to know. So did Hassan. I\nknow  it  doesn't  absolve  anyone  of\nanything, but the Kabul we lived in in\nthose days was a strange world, one\nin  which  some  things  mattered  more\nthan the truth.<br><br>   Amir  jan,  I  know  how  hard  your\nfather  was  on  you  when  you  were\ngrowing  up.  I  saw  how  you  suffered\nand  yearned  for  his  affections,  and\nmy heart bled for you. But your father", "was a man torn between two halves,\nAmir  jan:  you  and  Hassan.  He  loved\nyou  both,  but  he  could  not  love\nHassan  the  way  he  longed  to,\nopenly, and as a father. So he took it\nout on you instead--Amir, the socially\nlegitimate  half,  the  half  that\nrepresented  the  riches  he  had\ninherited  and  the  sin-with-impunity\nprivileges that came with them. When\nhe saw you, he saw himself. And his\nguilt. You are still angry and I realize\nit  is  far  too  early  to  expect  you  to\naccept this, but maybe someday you\nwill  see  that  when  your  father  was\nhard on you, he was also being hard\non himself. Your father, like you, was\na tortured soul, Amir jan.<br><br>   I  cannot  describe  to  you  the  depth\nand  blackness  of  the  sorrow  that\ncame  over  me  when  I  learned  of  his\npassing. I loved him because he was\nmy friend, but \nalso  because  he  was  a  good  man,\nmaybe even a great man. And this is\nwhat  I  want  you  to  understand,  that", "good, real good, was born out of your\nfather's  remorse.  Sometimes,  I  think\neverything  he  did,  feeding  the  poor\non  the  streets,  building  the\norphanage,  giving  money  to  friends\nin  need,  it  was  all  his  way  of\nredeeming  himself.  And  that,  I\nbelieve,  is  what  true  redemption  is,\nAmir jan, when guilt leads to good.<br><br>   I  know  that  in  the  end,  God  will\nforgive.  He  will  forgive  your  father,\nme,  and  you  too.  I  hope  you  can  do\nthe  same.  Forgive  your  father  if  you\ncan.  Forgive  me  if  you  wish.  But,\nmost important, forgive yourself.<br><br> I have left you some money, most of\nwhat  I  have  left,  in  fact.  I  think  you\nmay  have  some  expenses  when  you\nreturn  here,  and  the  money  should\nbe enough to cover them. There is a\nbank  in  Peshawar;  Farid  knows  the\nlocation.  The  money  is  in  a\nsafe-deposit  box.  I  have  given  you\nthe key. ", "    As  for  me,  it  is  time  to  go.  I  have\nlittle  time  left  and  I  wish  to  spend  it\nalone.  Please  do  not  look  for  me.\nThat is my final request of you.<br><br> I leave you in the hands of God.<br><br> Your friend always, <br><br> Rahim<br><br>\nI  dragged  the  hospital  gown  sleeve\nacross  my  eyes.  I  folded  the  letter\nand put it under my mattress.<br><br> Amir, the socially legitimate half, the\nhalf  that  represented  the  riches  he\nhad  inherited  and  the\nsin-with-impunity privileges that came\nwith them. Maybe that was why Baba\nand I had been on such better terms\nin  the  U.S.,  I  wondered.  Selling  junk\nfor  petty  cash,  our  menial  jobs,  our\ngrimy  apartment--the  American\nversion  of  a  hut;  maybe  in  America,", "when  Baba  looked  at  me,  he  saw  a\nlittle bit of Hassan.<br><br>  Your father, like you, was a tortured\nsoul, Rahim Khan had written. Maybe\nso.  We  had  both  sinned  and\nbetrayed. But Baba had found a way\nto  create  good  out  of  his  remorse.\nWhat had I done, other than take my\nguilt  out  on  the  very  same  people  I\nhad betrayed, and then try to forget it\nall?  What  had  I  done,  other  than\nbecome  an  insomniac?  What  had  I\never  done  to  right  things?  When  the\nnurse--not  Aisha  but  a  red-haired\nwoman  whose  name  escapes\nme--walked in with a syringe in hand\nand asked me if I needed a morphine\ninjection, I said yes.<br><br>\nTHEY  REMOVED  THE  CHEST\nTUBE  early  the  next  morning,  and\nArmand  gave  the  staff  the  go-ahead\nto  let  me  sip  apple  juice.  I  asked\nAisha  for  a  mirror  when  she  placed\nthe  cup  of  juice  on  the  dresser  next", "to  my  bed.  She  lifted  her  bifocals  to\nher  forehead  as  she  pulled  the\ncurtain open and let the morning sun\nflood  the  room.  \"Remember,  now,\"\nshe  said  over  her  shoulder,  \"it  will\nlook  better  in  a  few  days.  My\nson-in-law  was  in  a  moped  accident\nlast  year.  His  handsome  face  was\ndragged  on  the  asphalt  and  became\npurple  like  an  eggplant.  Now  he  is\nbeautiful  again,  like  a  Hollywood\nmovie star.\"<br><br>   Despite  her  reassurances,  looking\nin the mirror and seeing the thing that\ninsisted it was my face left me a little\nbreathless.  It  looked  like  someone\nhad  stuck  an  air  pump  nozzle  under\nmy  skin  and  had  pumped  away.  My\neyes  were  puffy  and  blue.  The  worst\nof it was my mouth, a grotesque blob\nof  purple  and  red,  all  bruise  and\nstitches. I tried to smile and a bolt of\npain  ripped  through  my  lips.  I\nwouldn't  be  doing  that  for  a  while.\nThere  were  stitches  across  my  left\ncheek,  just  under  the  chin,  on  the", "forehead just below the hairline.<br><br>   The  old  guy  with  the  leg  cast  said\nsomething  in  Urdu.  I  gave  him  a\nshrug  and  shook  my  head.  He\npointed  to  his  face,  patted  it,  and\ngrinned  a  wide,  toothless  grin.  \"Very\ngood,\"  he  said  in  English.  \"Ins\nhallah**.\"<br><br> \"Thank you,\" I whispered.<br><br>   Farid  and  Sohrab  came  in  just  as  I\nput  the  mirror  away.  Sohrab  took  his\nseat on the stool, rested his head on\nthe bed's side rail.<br><br>   \"You  know,  the  sooner  we  get  you\nout of here the better,\" Farid said.<br><br>  \"Dr. Faruqi says--\"- <br><br>   \"I  don't  mean  the  hospital.  I  mean\nPeshawar.\"<br><br> \"Why?\"<br><br>   \"I  don't  think  you'll  be  safe  here  for", "long,\"  Farid  said.  He  lowered  his\nvoice.<br><br>   \"The  Taliban  have  friends  here.\nThey will start looking for you.\"<br><br>   \"I  think  they  already  may  have,\"  I\nmurmured.  I  thought  suddenly  of  the\nbearded  man  who'd  wandered  into\nthe room and just stood there staring\nat me.<br><br>   Farid  leaned  in.  \"As  soon  as  you\ncan  walk,  I'll  take  you  to  Islamabad.\nNot  entirely  safe  there  either,  no\nplace  in  Pakistan  is,  but  it's  better\nthan  here.  At  least  it  will  buy  you\nsome time.\"<br><br> \"Farid jan, this can't be safe for you\neither.  Maybe  you  shouldn't  be  seen\nwith  me.  You  have  a  family  to  take\ncare of.\"<br><br>   Farid  made  a  waving  gesture.  \"My\nboys  are  young,  but  they  are  very\nshrewd. They know how to take care", "of  their  mothers  and  sisters.\"  He\nsmiled. \"Besides, I didn't say I'd do it\nfor free.\"<br><br>   \"I  wouldn't  let  you  if  you  offered,\"  I\nsaid.  I  forgot  I  couldn't  smile  and\ntried.  A  tiny  streak  of  blood  trickled\ndown my chin. \"Can I ask you for one\nmore favor?\"<br><br>   \"For  you  a  thousand  times  over,\"\nFarid said.<br><br>   And,  just  like  that,  I  was  crying.  I\nhitched  gusts  of  air,  tears  gushing\ndown  my  cheeks,  stinging  the  raw\nflesh of my lips.<br><br>     \"What's  the  matter?\"  Farid  said,\nalarmed.<br><br>   I  buried  my  face  in  one  hand  and\nheld  up  the  other.  I  knew  the  whole\nroom  was  watching  me.  After,  I  felt\ntired,  hollow.  \"I'm  sorry,\"  I  said.\nSohrab  was  looking  at  me  with  a\nfrown creasing his brow. ", "  When I could talk again, I told Farid\nwhat  I  needed.  \"Rahim  Khan  said\nthey live here in Peshawar.\"<br><br> \"Maybe you should write down their\nnames,\"  Farid  said,  eyeing  me\ncautiously,  as  if  wondering  what\nmight set me off next. I scribbled their\nnames  on  a  scrap  of  paper  towel.\n\"John and Betty Caldwell.\"<br><br>   Farid  pocketed  the  folded  piece  of\npaper. \"I will look for them as soon as\nI can,\" he said. He turned to Sohrab.\n\"As  for  you,  I'll  pick  you  up  this\nevening.  Don't  tire  Amir  agha  too\nmuch.\"<br><br>   But  Sohrab  had  wandered  to  the\nwindow,  where  a  half-dozen  pigeons\nstrutted  back  and  forth  on  the  sill,\npecking  at  wood  and  scraps  of  old\nbread.<br><br>\nIN  THE  MIDDLE  DRAWER  of  the", "dresser  beside  my  bed,  I  had  found\nan  old  National  Geographic\nmagazine,  a  chewed-up  pencil,  a\ncomb  with  missing  teeth,  and  what  I\nwas reaching for now, sweat pouring\ndown my face from the effort: a deck\nof  cards.  I  had  counted  them  earlier\nand,  surprisingly,  found  the  deck\ncomplete.  I  asked  Sohrab  if  he\nwanted to play. I didn't expect him to\nanswer,  let  alone  play.  He'd  been\nquiet since we had fled Kabul.<br><br> But he turned from the window and\nsaid,  \"The  only  game  I  know  is\npanjpar.\"<br><br>   \"I  feel  sorry  for  you  already,\nbecause  I  am  a  grand  master  at\npanjpar. World renowned.\"<br><br>     He  took  his  seat  on  the  stool  next\nto  me.  I  dealt  him  his  five  cards.\n\"When  your  father  and  I  were  your\nage,  we  used  to  play  this  game.\nEspecially  in  the  winter,  when  it\nsnowed  and  we  couldn't  go  outside.\nWe  used  to  play  until  the  sun  went", "down.\"<br><br>   He  played  me  a  card  and  picked\none  up  from  the  pile.  I  stole  looks  at\nhim  as  he  pondered  his  cards.  He\nwas  his  father  in  so  many  ways:  the\nway  he  fanned  out  his  cards  with\nboth  hands,  the  way  he  squinted\nwhile reading them, the way he rarely\nlooked a person in the eye.<br><br> We played in silence. I won the first\ngame,  let  him  win  the  next  one,  and\nlost  the  next  five  fair  and  square.\n\"You're  as  good  as  your  father,\nmaybe  even  better,\"  I  said,  after  my\nlast  loss.  \"I  used  to  beat  him\nsometimes, but I think he let me win.\"\nI  paused  before  saying,  \"Your  father\nand  I  were  nursed  by  the  same\nwoman.\"<br><br> \"I know.\"<br><br>   \"What...  what  did  he  tell  you  about\nus?\" ", "    \"That  you  were  the  best  friend  he\never had,\" he said.<br><br> I twirled the jack of diamonds in my\nfingers,  flipped  it  back  and  forth.  \"I\nwasn't such a good friend, I'm afraid,\"\nI said. \"But I'd like to be your friend. I\nthink I could be a good friend to you.\nWould  that  be  all  right?  Would  you\nlike that?\" I put my hand on his arm,\ngingerly, but he flinched. He dropped\nhis  cards  and  pushed  away  on  the\nstool. He walked back to the window.\nThe  sky  was  awash  with  streaks  of\nred  and  purple  as  the  sun  set  on\nPeshawar.  From  the  street  below\ncame a succession of honks and the\nbraying  of  a  donkey,  the  whistle  of  a\npoliceman.  Sohrab  stood  in  that\ncrimson  light,  forehead  pressed  to\nthe glass, fists buried in his armpits.<br><br>\nAISHA  HAD  A  MALE  ASSISTANT\nhelp me take my first steps that night.\nI only walked around the room once,", "one  hand  clutching  the  wheeled  IV\nstand, the \nother  clasping  the  assistant's  fore\narm.  It  took  me  ten  minutes  to  make\nit  back  to  bed,  and,  by  then,  the\nincision on my stomach throbbed and\nI'd broken out in a drenching sweat. I\nlay  in  bed,  gasping,  my  heart\nhammering  in  my  ears,  thinking  how\nmuch I missed my wife.<br><br>   Sohrab  and  I  played  panjpar  most\nof the next day, again in silence. And\nthe  day  after  that.  We  hardly  spoke,\njust  played  panjpar,  me  propped  in\nbed,  he  on  the  three-legged  stool,\nour routine broken only by my taking\na  walk  around  the  room,  or  going  to\nthe  bathroom  down  the  hall.  I  had  a\ndream  later  that  night.  I  dreamed\nAssef was standing in the doorway of\nmy  hospital  room,  brass  ball  still  in\nhis eye socket. \"We're the same, you\nand  I,\"  he  was  saying.  \"You  nursed\nwith him, but you're my twin.\"<br><br>", "I TOLD ARMAND early that next day\nthat I was leaving.<br><br>   \"It's  still  early  for  discharge,\"\nArmand  protested.  He  wasn't\ndressed  in  surgical  scrubs  that  day,\ninstead  in  a  button-down  navy  blue\nsuit and yellow tie. The gel was back\nin  the  hair.  \"You  are  still  in\nintravenous antibiotics and--\"<br><br>   \"I  have  to  go,\"  I  said.  \"I  appreciate\neverything  you've  done  for  me,  all  of\nyou.<br><br> Really. But I have to leave.\"<br><br> \"Where will you go?\" Armand said.<br><br> \"I'd rather not say.\"<br><br> \"You can hardly walk.\"<br><br> \"I can walk to the end of the hall and\nback,\" I said. \"I'll be fine.\" <br><br>   The  plan  was  this:  Leave  the", "hospital.  Get  the  money  from  the\nsafe-deposit box and pay my medical\nbills.  Drive  to  the  orphanage  and\ndrop  Sohrab  off  with  John  and  Betty\nCaldwell.  Then  get  a  ride  to\nIslamabad  and  change  travel  plans.\nGive  myself  a  few  more  days  to  get\nbetter. Fly home.<br><br>   That  was  the  plan,  anyway.  Until\nFarid  and  Sohrab  arrived  that\nmorning. \"Your friends, this John and\nBetty  Caldwell,  they  aren't  in\nPeshawar,\" Farid said.<br><br> It had taken me ten minutes just to\nslip into my pirhan tumban. My chest,\nwhere  they'd  cut  me  to  insert  the\nchest  tube  hurt  when  I  raised  my\narm, and my stomach throbbed every\ntime  I  leaned  over.  I  was  drawing\nragged breaths just from the effort of\npacking  a  few  of  my  belongings  into\na brown paper bag. But I'd managed\nto  get  ready  and  was  sitting  on  the\nedge  of  the  bed  when  Farid  came  in\nwith the news. Sohrab sat on the bed", "next to me.<br><br> \"Where did they go?\" I asked.<br><br>   Farid  shook  his  head.  \"You  don't\nunderstand--\"<br><br> \"Because Rahim Khan said--\"<br><br> \"I went to the U.S. consulate,\" Farid\nsaid,  picking  up  my  bag.  \"There\nnever was a John and Betty Caldwell\nin Peshawar.

Plus, I\nsuspected  every  bearded  man  who\nstared at me to be a Talib killer, sent\nby  Assef.  Two  things  compounded\nmy  fears:  There  are  a  lot  of  bearded\nmen  in  Peshawar,  and  everybody\nstares.<br><br>   \"What  do  we  do  with  him?\"  Farid\nsaid,  walking  me  slowly  from  the\nhospital accounting office back to the\ncar.  Sohrab  was  in  the  backseat  of\nthe  Land  Cruiser,  looking  at  traffic\nthrough the rolled-down window, chin\nresting on his palms.<br><br> \"He can't stay in Peshawar,\" I said,\npanting.<br><br>   \"Nay,  Amir  agha,  he  can't,\"  Farid", "said.  He'd  read  the  question  in  my\nwords. \"I'm sorry. I wish I--\"<br><br>   \"That's  all  right,  Farid,\"  I  said.  I\nmanaged  a  tired  smile.  \"You  have\nmouths to feed.\" A dog was standing\nnext to the truck now, propped on its\nrear  legs,  paws  on  the  truck's  door,\ntail  wagging.  Sohrab  was  petting  the\ndog.  \"I  guess  he  goes  to  Islamabad\nfor now,\" I said.<br><br>\nI  SLEPT  THROUGH  almost  the\nentire  four-hour  ride  to  Islamabad.  I\ndreamed  a  lot,  and  most  of  it  I  only\nremember  as  a  hodgepodge  of\nimages,  snippets  of  visual  memory\nflashing  in  my  head  like  cards  in  a\nRolodex:  Baba  marinating  lamb  for\nmy  thirteenth  birthday  party.  Soraya\nand  I  making  love  for  the  first  time,\nthe  sun  rising  in  the  east,  our  ears\nstill  ringing  from  the  wedding  music,\nher  henna-painted  hands  laced  in\nmine.  The  time  Baba  had  taken", "Hassan  and  me  to  a  strawberry  field\nin  Jalalabad--the  owner  had  told  us\nwe could eat as much as we wanted\nto as long as we bought at least four\nkilos--and  how  we'd  both  ended  up\nwith  bellyaches.  How  dark,  almost\nblack, Hassan's blood had looked on\nthe  snow,  dropping  from  the  seat  of\nhis  pants.  Blood  is  a  powerful  thing,\nbachem.  Khala  Jamila  patting\nSoraya's  knee  and  saying,  God\nknows best, maybe it wasn't meant to\nbe.  Sleeping  on  the  roof  of  my\nfather's  house.  Baba  saying  that  the\nonly  sin  that  mattered  was  theft.\nWhen you tell a lie, you steal a man's\nright to the truth. \nRahim Khan on the phone, telling me\nthere was a way to be good again. A\nway to be good again...", "#$#$Chapter 24#$#$<br><br>If  Peshawar  was  the  city  that\nreminded  me  of  what  Kabul  used  to\nbe,  then  Islamabad  was  the  city\nKabul  could  have  become  someday.\nThe  streets  were  wider  than\nPeshawar's,  cleaner,  and  lined  with\nrows of hibiscus and flame trees. The\nbazaars  were  more  organized  and\nnot nearly as clogged with rickshaws\nand  pedestrians.  The  architecture\nwas more elegant too, more modern,\nand  I  saw  parks  where  roses  and\njasmine  bloomed  in  the  shadows  of\ntrees.<br><br> Farid found a small hotel on a side\nstreet  running  along  the  foot  of  the\nMargalla  Hills.  We  passed  the\nfamous  Shah  Faisal  Mosque  on  the\nway  there,  reputedly  the  biggest\nmosque  in  the  world,  with  its  giant\nconcrete  girders  and  soaring\nminarets.  Sohrab  perked  up  at  the", "sight  of  the  mosque,  leaned  out  of\nthe  window  and  looked  at  it  until\nFarid turned a corner.<br><br>\nTHE  HOTEL  ROOM  was  a  vast\nimprovement  over  the  one  in  Kabul\nwhere  Farid  and  I  had  stayed.  The\nsheets  were  clean,  the  carpet\nvacuumed,  and  the  bathroom\nspotless. There was shampoo, soap,\nrazors  for  shaving,  a  bathtub,  and\ntowels  that  smelled  like  lemon.  And\nno  bloodstains  on  the  walls.  One\nother thing: a television set sat on the\ndresser  across  from  the  two  single\nbeds.<br><br>   \"Look!\"  I  said  to  Sohrab.  I  turned  it\non  manually--no  remote--and  turned\nthe  dial.  I  found  a  children's  show\nwith two fluffy sheep puppets singing\nin Urdu. <br><br> Sohrab sat on one of the beds and\ndrew  his  knees  to  his  chest.  Images\nfrom  the  TV  reflected  in  his  green", "eyes  as  he  watched,  stone-faced,\nrocking back and forth. I remembered\nthe time I'd promised Hassan I'd buy\nhis  family  a  color  TV  when  we  both\ngrew up.<br><br>   \"I'll  get  going,  Amir  agha,\"  Farid\nsaid.<br><br>   \"Stay  the  night,\"  I  said.  \"It's  a  long\ndrive. Leave tomorrow.\"<br><br>   \"Tashakor,\"  he  said.  \"But  I  want  to\nget back tonight. I miss my children.\"\nOn  his  way  out  of  the  room,  he\npaused  in  the  doorway.  \"Good-bye,\nSohrab jan,\" he said. He waited for a\nreply,  but  Sohrab  paid  him  no\nattention. Just rocked back and forth,\nhis  face  lit  by  the  silver  glow  of  the\nimages flickering across the screen.<br><br>   Outside,  I  gave  him  an  envelope.\nWhen he tore it, his mouth opened.<br><br>   \"I  didn't  know  how  to  thank  you,\"  I\nsaid. \"You've done so much for me.\" ", "    \"How  much  is  in  here?\"  Farid  said,\nslightly dazed.<br><br> \"A little over two thousand dollars.\"<br><br> \"Two thou--\" he began. His lower lip\nwas quivering a little. Later, when he\npulled  away  from  the  curb,  he\nhonked  twice  and  waved.  I  waved\nback. I never saw him again.<br><br>   I  returned  to  the  hotel  room  and\nfound Sohrab lying on the bed, curled\nup  in  a  big  C.  His  eyes  were  closed\nbut  I  couldn't  tell  if  he  was  sleeping.\nHe  had  shut  off  the  television.  I  sat\non  my  bed  and  grimaced  with  pain,\nwiped  the  cool  sweat  off  my  brow.  I\nwondered  how  much  longer  it  would\nhurt  to  get  up,  sit  down,  roll  over  in\nbed.  I  wondered  when  I'd  be  able  to\neat solid food. I wondered what I'd do\nwith  the  wounded  little  boy  lying  on\nthe bed, though a part of me already\nknew. <br><br> There was a carafe of water on the", "dresser.  I  poured  a  glass  and  took\ntwo of Armand's pain pills. The water\nwas  warm  and  bitter.  I  pulled  the\ncurtains,  eased  myself  back  on  the\nbed,  and  lay  down.  I  thought  my\nchest would rip open. When the pain\ndropped  a  notch  and  I  could  breathe\nagain,  I  pulled  the  blanket  to  my\nchest and waited for Armand's pills to\nwork.<br><br>\nWHEN  I  WOKE  UP,  the  room  was\ndarker.  The  slice  of  sky  peeking\nbetween  the  curtains  was  the  purple\nof  twilight  turning  into  night.  The\nsheets  were  soaked  and  my  head\npounded.  I'd  been  dreaming  again,\nbut  I  couldn't  remember  what  it  had\nbeen about.<br><br>   My  heart  gave  a  sick  lurch  when  I\nlooked  to  Sohrab's  bed  and  found  it\nempty  I  called  his  name.  The  sound\nof  my  voice  startled  me.  It  was\ndisorienting,  sitting  in  a  dark  hotel", "room, thousands of miles from home,\nmy  body  broken,  calling  the  name  of\na  boy  I'd  only  met  a  few  days  ago.  I\ncalled  his  name  again  and  heard\nnothing.  I  struggled  out  of  bed,\nchecked  the  bathroom,  looked  in  the\nnarrow hallway outside the room. He\nwas gone.<br><br> I locked the door and hobbled to the\nmanager's  office  in  the  lobby,  one\nhand  clutching  the  rail  along  the\nwalkway  for  support.  There  was  a\nfake, dusty palm tree in the corner of\nthe  lobby  and  flying  pink  flamingos\non  the  wallpaper.  I  found  the  hotel\nmanager  reading  a  newspaper\nbehind  the  Formica-topped  check-in\ncounter.  I  described  Sohrab  to  him,\nasked if he'd seen him. He put down\nhis  paper  and  took  off  his  reading\nglasses.  He  had  greasy  hair  and  a\nsquare-shaped  little  mustache\nspeckled  with  gray.  He  smelled\nvaguely  of  some  tropical  fruit  I\ncouldn't quite recognize. ", "    \"Boys,  they  like  to  run  around,\"  he\nsaid,  sighing.  \"I  have  three  of  them.\nAll  day  they  are  running  around,\ntroubling their mother.\" He fanned his\nface  with  the  newspaper,  staring  at\nmy jaws.<br><br>   \"I  don't  think  he's  out  running\naround,\"  I  said.  \"And  we're  not  from\nhere. I'm afraid he might get lost.\"<br><br>   He  bobbed  his  head  from  side  to\nside. \"Then you should have kept an\neye on the boy, mister.\"<br><br>     \"I  know,\"  I  said.  \"But  I  fell  asleep\nand when I woke up, he was gone.\"<br><br>   \"Boys  must  be  tended  to,  you\nknow.\"<br><br>   \"Yes,\"  I  said,  my  pulse  quickening.\nHow  could  he  be  so  oblivious  to  my\napprehension?  He  shifted  the\nnewspaper  to  his  other  hand,\nresumed the fanning.<br><br> \"They want bicycles now\" ", "  \"Who?\"<br><br> \"My boys,\" he said. \"They're saying,\n'Daddy,  Daddy,  please  buy  us\nbicycles  and  we'll  not  trouble  you.\nPlease,  Daddy!\"  He  gave  a  short\nlaugh  through  his  nose.  \"Bicycles.\nTheir  mother  will  kill  me,  I  swear  to\nyou.\"<br><br>   I  imagined  Sohrab  lying  in  a  ditch.\nOr  in  the  trunk  of  some  car,  bound\nand  gagged.  I  didn't  want  his  blood\non my hands. Not his too. \"Please...\"\nI said. I squinted. Read his name tag\non  the  lapel  of  his  short-sleeve  blue\ncotton  shirt.  \"Mr.  Fayyaz,  have  you\nseen him?\"<br><br> \"The boy?\"<br><br>   I  bit  down.  \"Yes,  the  boy!  The  boy\nwho  came  with  me.  Have  you  seen\nhim or not, for God's sake?\"<br><br>   The  fanning  stopped.  His  eyes", "narrowed. \"No getting smart with me,\nmy  friend.  I  am  not  the  one  who  lost\nhim.\"<br><br> That he had a point did not stop the\nblood  from  rushing  to  my  face.\n\"You're  right.  I'm  wrong.  My  fault.\nNow, have you seen him?\" <br><br>   \"Sorry,\"  he  said  curtly.  He  put  his\nglasses  back  on.  Snapped  his\nnewspaper open.<br><br> \"I have seen no such boy.\"<br><br>   I  stood  at  the  counter  for  a  minute,\ntrying not to scream. As I was exiting\nthe  lobby,  he  said,  \"Any  idea  where\nhe might have wandered to?\"<br><br>   \"No,\"  I  said.  I  felt  tired.  Tired  and\nscared.<br><br>   \"Does  he  have  any  interests?\"  he\nsaid.  I  saw  he  had  folded  the  paper.\n\"My  boys,  for  example,  they  will  do\nanything  for  American  action  films,\nespecially  with  that  Arnold", "??WThatsanegger--\"<br><br>   \"The  mosque!\"  I  said.  \"The  big\nmosque.\"  I  remembered  the  way  the\nmosque  had  jolted  Sohrab  from  his\nstupor  when  we'd  driven  by  it,  how\nhe'd leaned out of the window looking\nat it.<br><br> \"Shah Faisal?\"<br><br> \"Yes. Can you take me there?\"<br><br>   \"Did  you  know  it's  the  biggest\nmosque in the world?\" he asked.<br><br> \"No, but--\"<br><br>   \"The  courtyard  alone  can  fit  forty\nthousand people.\"<br><br> \"Can you take me there?\"<br><br> \"It's only a kilometer from here,\" he\nsaid.  But  he  was  already  pushing\naway from the counter.<br><br>  \"I'll pay you for the ride,\" I said. ", "    He  sighed  and  shook  his  head.\n\"Wait  here.\"  He  disappeared  into  the\nback room, returned wearing another\npair  of  eyeglasses,  a  set  of  keys  in\nhand,  and  with  a  short,  chubby\nwoman in an orange sari trailing him.\nShe took his seat behind the counter.\n\"I  don't  take  your  money,\"  he  said,\nblowing  by  me.  \"I  will  drive  you\nbecause I am a father like you.\"<br><br>\nI  THOUGHT  WE'D  END  UP\nDRIVING  around  the  city  until  night\nfell.  I  saw  myself  calling  the  police,\ndescribing  Sohrab  to  them  under\nFayyaz's  reproachful  glare.  I  heard\nthe  officer,  his  voice  tired  and\nuninterested,  asking  his  obligatory\nquestions.  And  beneath  the  official\nquestions, an unofficial one: Who the\nhell  cared  about  another  dead\nAfghan  kid?  But  we  found  him  about\na  hundred  yards  from  the  mosque,\nsitting  in  the  half-full  parking  lot,  on", "an  island  of  grass.  Fayyaz  pulled  up\nto  the  island  and  let  me  out.  \"I  have\nto get back,\" he said.<br><br> \"That's fine. We'll walk back,\" I said.\n\"Thank you, Mr. Fayyaz. Really.\"<br><br>   He  leaned  across  the  front  seat\nwhen I got out. \"Can I say something\nto you?\"<br><br> \"Sure.\"<br><br>   In  the  dark  of  twilight,  his  face  was\njust  a  pair  of  eyeglasses  reflecting\nthe fading light. \"The thing about you\nAfghanis  is  that...  well,  you  people\nare a little reckless.\"<br><br>   I  was  tired  and  in  pain.  My  jaws\nthrobbed.  And  those  damn  wounds\non  my  chest  and  stomach  felt  like\nbarbed  wire  under  my  skin.  But  I\nstarted to laugh anyway.<br><br>   \"What...  what  did  I...\"  Fayyaz  was\nsaying,  but  I  was  cackling  by  then,", "full-throated bursts of laughter spilling\nthrough my wired mouth.<br><br>     \"Crazy  people,\"  he  said.  His  tires\nscreeched when he peeled away, his\ntail-lights  blinking  red  in  the  dimming\nlight.<br><br> \"You GAVE ME A GOOD SCARE,\"\nI  said.  I  sat  beside  him,  wincing  with\npain as I bent.<br><br>   He  was  looking  at  the  mosque.\nShah Faisal Mosque was shaped like\na  giant  tent.  Cars  came  and  went;\nworshipers  dressed  in  white\nstreamed  in  and  out.  We  sat  in\nsilence,  me  leaning  against  the  tree,\nSohrab  next  to  me,  knees  to  his\nchest.  We  listened  to  the  call  to\nprayer,  watched  the  building's\nhundreds  of  lights  come  on  as\ndaylight faded. The mosque sparkled\nlike a diamond in the dark. It lit up the\nsky, Sohrab's face.<br><br>   \"Have  you  ever  been  to\nMazar-i-Sharif?\"  Sohrab  said,  his", "chin resting on his kneecaps.<br><br> \"A long time ago. I don't remember\nit much.\"<br><br>   \"Father  took  me  there  when  I  was\nlittle.  Mother  and  Sasa  came  along\ntoo.  Father  bought  me  a  monkey\nfrom  the  bazaar.  Not  a  real  one  but\nthe  kind  you  have  to  blow  up.  It  was\nbrown and had a bow tie.\"<br><br>   \"I  might  have  had  one  of  those\nwhen I was a kid.\"<br><br>   \"Father  took  me  to  the  Blue\nMosque,\"  Sohrab  said.  \"I  remember\nthere  were  so  many  pigeons  outside\nthe masjid, and they weren't afraid of\npeople.  They  came  right  up  to  us.\nSasa  gave  me  little  pieces  of  naan\nand I fed the birds. Soon, there were\npigeons  cooing  all  around  me.  That\nwas fun.\"<br><br>   \"You  must  miss  your  parents  very\nmuch,\" I said. I wondered if he'd seen", "the  Taliban  drag  his  parents  out  into\nthe street. I hoped he hadn't.<br><br>   \"Do  you  miss  your  parents?\"  he\nasked,  resting  his  cheek  on  his\nknees, looking up at me.<br><br>     \"Do  I  miss  my  parents?  Well,  I\nnever met my mother. My father died\na few years ago, and, yes, I do miss\nhim. Sometimes a lot.\"<br><br>   \"Do  you  remember  what  he  looked\nlike?\"<br><br>   I  thought  of  Baba's  thick  neck,  his\nblack  eyes,  his  unruly  brown  hair.\nSitting on his lap had been like sitting\non a pair of tree trunks. \"I remember\nwhat he looked like,\" I said. \"What he\nsmelled like too.\"<br><br>   \"I'm  starting  to  forget  their  faces,\"\nSohrab said. \"Is that bad?\"<br><br>   \"No,\"  I  said.  \"Time  does  that.\"  I\nthought of something. I looked in the\nfront  pocket  of  my  coat.  Found  the", "Polaroid  snap  shot  of  Hassan  and\nSohrab. \"Here,\" I said.<br><br>   He  brought  the  photo  to  within  an\ninch of his face, turned it so the light\nfrom the mosque fell on it. He looked\nat  it  for  a  long  time.  I  thought  he\nmight cry, but he didn't. He just held it\nin both hands, traced his thumb over\nits surface. I thought of a line I'd read\nsomewhere,  or  maybe  I'd  heard\nsomeone  say  it:  There  are  a  lot  of\nchildren  in  Afghanistan,  but  little\nchildhood.  He  stretched  his  hand  to\ngive it back to me.<br><br> \"Keep it,\" I said. \"It's yours.\"<br><br> \"Thank you.\" He looked at the photo\nagain  and  stowed  it  in  the  pocket  of\nhis  vest.  A  horse-drawn  cart\nclip-clopped  by  in  the  parking  lot.\nLittle  bells  dangled  from  the  horse's\nneck and jingled with each step.<br><br>   \"I've  been  thinking  a  lot  about\nmosques lately,\" Sohrab said.

Now  he  was  crying,\nsoftly,  silently.  \"Can  I  ask  you\nsomething, Amir agha?\"<br><br> \"Of course.\"<br><br> \"Will God...\" he began, and choked\na  little.  \"Will  God  put  me  in  hell  for\nwhat I did to that man?\"<br><br> I reached for him and he flinched. I\npulled  back.  \"Nay.  Of  course  not,\"  I\nsaid. I wanted to pull him close, hold\nhim,  tell  him  the  world  had  been\nunkind  to  him,  not  the  other  way\naround.<br><br> His face twisted and strained to stay\ncomposed.  \"Father  used  to  say  it's\nwrong  to  hurt  even  bad  people.\nBecause  they  don't  know  any  better,\nand  because  bad  people  sometimes\nbecome good.\" ", "  \"Not always, Sohrab.\"<br><br> He looked at me questioningly.<br><br> \"The man who hurt you, I knew him\nfrom  many  years  ago,\"  I  said.  \"I\nguess  you  figured  that  out  that  from\nthe  conversation  he  and  I  had.

It  felt  good\nbeing  there,  with  my  half  brother's\nson, playing \ncards,  the  warmth  of  the  sun  patting\nthe  back  of  my  neck.  The  song\nended and another one started, one I\ndidn't recognize. ", "    \"Look,\"  Sohrab  said.  He  was\npointing  to  the  sky  with  his  cards.  I\nlooked up, saw a hawk circling in the\nbroad  seamless  sky.  \"Didn't  know\nthere  were  hawks  in  Islamabad,\"  I\nsaid.<br><br>   \"Me  neither,\"  he  said,  his  eyes\ntracing  the  bird's  circular  flight.  \"Do\nthey have them where you live?\"<br><br>   \"San  Francisco?  I  guess  so.  I  can't\nsay I've seen too many, though.\"<br><br> \"Oh,\" he said. I was hoping he'd ask\nmore, but he dealt another hand and\nasked  if  we  could  eat.  I  opened  the\npaper bag and gave him his meatball\nsandwich.  My  lunch  consisted  of  yet\nanother cup of blended bananas and\noranges--I'd  rented  Mrs.  Fayyaz's\nblender  for  the  week.  I  sucked\nthrough  the  straw  and  my  mouth\nfilled  with  the  sweet,  blended  fruit.\nSome of it dripped from the corner of\nmy lips. Sohrab handed me a napkin\nand  watched  me  dab  at  my  lips.  I", "smiled and he smiled back.<br><br> \"Your father and I were brothers,\" I\nsaid. It just came out. I had wanted to\ntell  him  the  night  we  had  sat  by  the\nmosque,  but  I  hadn't.  But  he  had  a\nright  to  know;  I  didn't  want  to  hide\nanything  anymore.  \"Half  brothers,\nreally. We had the same father.\"<br><br>   Sohrab  stopped  chewing.  Put  the\nsandwich  down.  \"Father  never  said\nhe had a brother.\"<br><br> \"That's because he didn't know.\"<br><br> \"Why didn't he know?\"<br><br>   \"No  one  told  him,\"  I  said.  \"No  one\ntold  me  either.  I  just  found  out\nrecently.\" <br><br> Sohrab blinked. Like he was looking\nat  me,  really  looking  at  me,  for  the\nvery  first  time.  \"But  why  did  people\nhide it from Father and you?\"<br><br>   \"You  know,  I  asked  myself  that", "same  question  the  other  day.  And\nthere's  an  answer,  but  not  a  good\none.  Let's  just  say  they  didn't  tell  us\nbecause  your  father  and  I...  we\nweren't supposed to be brothers.\"<br><br> \"Because he was a Hazara?\"<br><br>   I  willed  my  eyes  to  stay  on  him.\n\"Yes.\"<br><br> \"Did your father,\" he began, eyeing\nhis  food,  \"did  your  father  love  you\nand my father equally?\"<br><br>   I  thought  of  a  long  ago  day  at\nGhargha  Lake,  when  Baba  had\nallowed himself to pat Hassan on the\nback  when  Hassan's  stone  had  out\nskipped  mine.  I  pictured  Baba  in  the\nhospital  room,  beaming  as  they\nremoved  the  bandages  from\nHassan's  lips.  \"I  think  he  loved  us\nequally but differently.\"<br><br> \"Was he ashamed of my father?\" ", "    \"No,\"  I  said.  \"I  think  he  was\nashamed of himself.\"<br><br>   He  picked  up  his  sandwich  and\nnibbled at it silently.<br><br>\nWE  LEFT  LATE  THAT\nAFTERNOON,  tired  from  the  heat,\nbut  tired  in  a  pleasant  way.  All  the\nway back, I felt Sohrab watching me.\nI  had  the  driver  pull  over  at  a  store\nthat sold calling cards. I gave him the\nmoney  and  a  tip  for  running  in  and\nbuying me one. <br><br>   That  night,  we  were  lying  on  our\nbeds,  watching  a  talk  show  on  TV.\nTwo  clerics  with  pepper  gray  long\nbeards and white turbans were taking\ncalls  from  the  faithful  all  over  the\nworld. One caller from Finland, a guy\nnamed  Ayub,  asked  if  his  teenaged\nson  could  go  to  hell  for  wearing  his\nbaggy  pants  so  low  the  seam  of  his\nunderwear showed. ", "    \"I  saw  a  picture  of  San  Francisco\nonce,\" Sohrab said.<br><br> \"Really?\"<br><br>   \"There  was  a  red  bridge  and  a\nbuilding with a pointy top.\"<br><br> \"You should see the streets,\" I said.<br><br> \"What about them?\" He was looking\nat  me  now.  On  the  TV  screen,  the\ntwo  mullahs  were  consulting  each\nother.<br><br>   \"They're  so  steep,  when  you  drive\nup all you see is the hood of your car\nand the sky,\" I said.<br><br> \"It sounds scary,\" he said. He rolled\nto his side, facing me, his back to the\nTV.<br><br> \"It is the first few times,\" I said. \"But\nyou get used to it.\"<br><br> \"Does it snow there?\" ", "    \"No,  but  we  get  a  lot  of  fog.  You\nknow that red bridge you saw?\"<br><br> \"Yes.\" <br><br> \"Sometimes the fog is so thick in the\nmorning,  all  you  see  is  the  tip  of  the\ntwo towers poking through.\"<br><br>   There  was  wonder  in  his  smile.\n\"Oh.\"<br><br> \"Sohrab?\"<br><br> \"Yes.\"<br><br>   \"Have  you  given  any  thought  to\nwhat I asked you before?\"<br><br>   His  smiled  faded.  He  rolled  to  his\nback.  Laced  his  hands  under  his\nhead.  The  mullahs  decided  that\nAyub's  son  would  go  to  hell  after  all\nfor wearing his pants the way he did.\nThey  claimed  it  was  in  the  Haddith.\n\"I've thought about it,\" Sohrab said. ", "  \"And?\"<br><br> \"It scares me.\"<br><br>   \"I  know  it's  a  little  scary,\"  I  said,\ngrabbing  onto  that  loose  thread  of\nhope.<br><br> \"But you'll learn English so fast and\nyou'll get used to--\"<br><br>   \"That's  not  what  I  mean.  That\nscares me too, but...<br><br> \"But what?\"<br><br>   He  rolled  toward  me  again.  Drew\nhis knees up. \"What if you get tired of\nme?  What  if  your  wife  doesn't  like\nme?\" <br><br>   I  struggled  out  of  bed  and  crossed\nthe  space  between  us.  I  sat  beside\nhim.  \"I  won't  ever  get  tired  of  you,\nSohrab,\"  I  said.  \"Not  ever.  That's  a\npromise.  You're  my  nephew,\nremember?  And  Soraya  jan,  she's  a\nvery  kind  woman.  Trust  me,  she's", "going to love you. I promise that too.\"\nI chanced something. Reached down\nand took his hand. He tightened up a\nlittle but let me hold it.<br><br>   \"I  don't  want  to  go  to  another\norphanage,\" he said.<br><br>   \"I  won't  ever  let  that  happen.  I\npromise you that.\" I cupped his hand\nin  both  of  mine.  \"Come  home  with\nme.\"<br><br>   His  tears  were  soaking  the  pillow.\nHe  didn't  say  anything  for  a  long\ntime.  Then  his  hand  squeezed  mine\nback. And he nodded. He nodded.<br><br>\nTHE  CONNECTION  WENT\nTHROUGH  on  the  fourth  try.  The\nphone  rang  three  times  before  she\npicked  it  up.  \"Hello?\"  It  was  7:30  in\nthe  evening  in  Islamabad,  roughly\nabout  the  same  time  in  the  morning\nin California. That meant Soraya had", "been up for an hour, getting ready for\nschool.<br><br> \"It's me,\" I said. I was sitting on my\nbed, watching Sohrab sleep.<br><br>   \"Amir!\"  she  almost  screamed.  \"Are\nyou okay? Where are you?\"<br><br> \"I'm in Pakistan.\"<br><br>   \"Why  didn't  you  call  earlier?  I've\nbeen  sick  with  tashweesh!  My\nmother's  praying  and  doing  nazr\nevery day.\"<br><br> \"I'm sorry I didn't call. I'm fine now.\"\nI  had  told  her  I'd  be  away  a  week,\ntwo  at  the  most.  I'd  been  gone  for\nnearly  a  month.  I  smiled.  \"And  tell\nKhala Jamila to stop killing sheep.\" <br><br> \"What do you mean 'fine now'? And\nwhat's wrong with your voice?\"<br><br> \"Don't worry about that for now. I'm\nfine. Really. Soraya, I have a story to\ntell  you,  a  story  I  should  have  told", "you  a  long  time  ago,  but  first  I  need\nto tell you one thing.\"<br><br>   \"What  is  it?\"  she  said,  her  voice\nlower now, more cautious.<br><br>   \"I'm  not  coming  home  alone.  I'm\nbringing  a  little  boy  with  me.\"  I\npaused. \"I want us to adopt him.\"<br><br> \"What?\"<br><br>   I  checked  my  watch.  \"I  have\nfifty-seven  minutes  left  on  this  stupid\ncalling  card  and  I  have  so  much  to\ntell you. Sit some where.\" I heard the\nlegs  of  a  chair  dragged  hurriedly\nacross the wooden floor.<br><br> \"Go ahead,\" she said.<br><br>   Then  I  did  what  I  hadn't  done  in\nfifteen  years  of  marriage:  I  told  my\nwife  everything.  Everything.  I  had\npictured this moment so many times,\ndreaded  it,  but,  as  I  spoke,  I  felt\nsomething  lifting  off  my  chest.  I", "imagined  Soraya  had  experienced\nsomething  very  similar  the  night  of\nour  khastegari,  when  she'd  told  me\nabout her past.<br><br>   By  the  time  I  was  done  with  my\nstory, she was weeping.<br><br> \"What do you think?\" I said.<br><br>   \"I  don't  know  what  to  think,  Amir.\nYou've told me so much all at once.\"<br><br> \"I realize that.\" <br><br> I heard her blowing her nose. \"But I\nknow  this  much:  You  have  to  bring\nhim home.<br><br> I want you to.\"<br><br>   \"Are  you  sure?\"  I  said,  closing  my\neyes and smiling.<br><br>   \"Am  I  sure?\"  she  said.  \"Amir,  he's\nyour  qaom,  your  family,  so  he's  my\nqaom  too.  Of  course  I'm  sure.  You\ncan't leave him to the streets.\" There", "was a short pause. \"What's he like?\"<br><br> I looked over at Sohrab sleeping on\nthe  bed.  \"He's  sweet,  in  a  solemn\nkind of way.\"<br><br>   \"Who  can  blame  him?\"  she  said.  \"I\nwant to see him, Amir. I really do.\"<br><br> \"Soraya?\"<br><br> \"Yeah.\"<br><br> \"Dostet darum.\" I love you.<br><br>   \"I  love  you  back,\"  she  said.  I  could\nhear the smile in her words. \"And be\ncareful.\"<br><br> \"I will. And one more thing. Don't tell\nyour  parents  who  he  is.  If  they  need\nto know, it should come from me.\"<br><br> \"Okay.\"<br><br> We hung up.<br><br>", " THE LAWN OUTSIDE the American\nembassy  in  Islamabad  was  neatly\nmowed,  dotted  with  circular  clusters\nof flowers, bordered by razor-straight\nhedges. The building itself was like a\nlot of buildings in Islamabad: flat and\nwhite.  We  passed  through  several\nroad  blocks  to  get  there  and  three\ndifferent  security  officials  conducted\na  body  search  on  me  after  the  wires\nin  my  jaws  set  off  the  metal\ndetectors. When we finally stepped in\nfrom the heat, the air-conditioning hit\nmy  face  like  a  splash  of  ice  water.\nThe  secretary  in  the  lobby,  a\nfifty-something,  lean-faced  blond\nwoman,  smiled  when  I  gave  her  my\nname.  She  wore  a  beige  blouse  and\nblack slacks--the first woman I'd seen\nin weeks dressed in something other\nthan  a  burqa  or  a  shalwar-kameez.\nShe  looked  me  up  on  the\nappointment  list,  tapping  the  eraser\nend  of  her  pencil  on  the  desk.  She\nfound  my  name  and  asked  me  to\ntake a seat. ", "    \"Would  you  like  some  lemonade?\"\nshe asked.<br><br> \"None for me, thanks,\" I said.<br><br> \"How about your son?\"<br><br> \"Excuse me?\"<br><br>   \"The  handsome  young  gentleman,\"\nshe said, smiling at Sohrab.<br><br> \"Oh. That'd be nice, thank you.\"<br><br>   Sohrab  and  I  sat  on  the  black\nleather  sofa  across  the  reception\ndesk,  next  to  a  tall  American  flag.\nSohrab  picked  up  a  magazine  from\nthe glass-top coffee table. He flipped\nthe  pages,  not  really  looking  at  the\npictures.<br><br> \"What?\" Sohrab said. <br><br> \"Sorry?\"<br><br> \"You're smiling.\" ", "  \"I was thinking about you,\" I said.<br><br> He gave a nervous smile. Picked up\nanother  magazine  and  flipped\nthrough it in under thirty seconds.<br><br> \"Don't be afraid,\" I said, touching his\narm.  \"These  people  are  friendly.\nRelax.\"  I  could  have  used  my  own\nadvice.  I  kept  shifting  in  my  seat,\nuntying  and  retying  my  shoelaces.\nThe  secretary  placed  a  tall  glass  of\nlemonade  with  ice  on  the  coffee\ntable. \"There you go.\"<br><br>   Sohrab  smiled  shyly.  \"Thank  you\nvery  much,\"  he  said  in  English.  It\ncame out as \"Tank you wery match.\"\nIt was the only English he knew, he'd\ntold me, that and \"Have a nice day.\"<br><br>   She  laughed.  \"You're  most\nwelcome.\"  She  walked  back  to  her\ndesk, high heels clicking on the floor.<br><br> \"Have a nice day,\" Sohrab said. ", " \nRAYMOND  ANDREWS  was  a  short\nfellow  with  small  hands,  nails\nperfectly  trimmed,  wedding  band  on\nthe  ring  finger.  He  gave  me  a  curt\nlittle  shake;  it  felt  like  squeezing  a\nsparrow.  Those  are  the  hands  that\nhold  our  fates,  I  thought  as  Sohrab\nand  I  seated  our  selves  across  from\nhis  desk.  A  Les  Miserables  poster\nwas  nailed  to  the  wall  behind\nAndrews next to a topographical map\nof  the  U.S.  A  pot  of  tomato  plants\nbasked in the sun on the windowsill.<br><br>   \"Smoke?\"  he  asked,  his  voice  a\ndeep  baritone  that  was  at  odds  with\nhis slight stature.<br><br>  \"No thanks,\" I said, not caring at all\nfor  the  way  Andrews's  eyes  barely\ngave Sohrab a glance, or the way he\ndidn't look at me when he spoke. He\npulled  open  a  desk  drawer  and  lit  a\ncigarette  from  a  half-empty  pack.  He\nalso  produced  a  bottle  of  lotion  from", "the  same  drawer.  He  looked  at  his\ntomato  plants  as  he  rubbed  lotion\ninto  his  hands,  cigarette  dangling\nfrom  the  corner  of  his  mouth.  Then\nhe closed the drawer, put his elbows\non  the  desktop,  and  exhaled.  \"So,\"\nhe  said,  crinkling  his  gray  eyes\nagainst  the  smoke,  \"tell  me  your\nstory.\"<br><br> I felt like Jean Valjean sitting across\nfrom  Javert.  I  reminded  myself  that  I\nwas  on  American  soil  now,  that  this\nguy was on my side, that he got paid\nfor helping people like me. \"I want to\nadopt  this  boy,  take  him  back  to  the\nStates with me,\" I said.<br><br>   \"Tell  me  your  story,\"  he  repeated,\ncrushing a flake of ash on the neatly\narranged  desk  with  his  index  finger,\nflicking it into the trash can.<br><br> I gave him the version I had worked\nout in my head since I'd hung up with\nSoraya.  I  had  gone  into  Afghanistan\nto bring back my half brother's son. I", "had  found  the  boy  in  squalid\nconditions,  wasting  away  in  an\norphanage. I had paid the orphanage\ndirector  a  sum  of  money  and\nwithdrawn  the  boy.  Then  I  had\nbrought him to Pakistan.<br><br> \"You are the boy's half uncle?\"<br><br> \"Yes.\"<br><br> He checked his watch. Leaned and\nturned  the  tomato  plants  on  the  sill.\n\"Know  anyone  who  can  attest  to\nthat?\"<br><br>   \"Yes,  but  I  don't  know  where  he  is\nnow.\"<br><br> He turned to me and nodded. I tried\nto  read  his  face  and  couldn't.  I\nwondered if he'd ever tried those little\nhands of his at poker. <br><br>   \"I  assume  getting  your  jaws  wired\nisn't the latest fashion statement,\" he\nsaid. We were in trouble, Sohrab and\nI,  and  I  knew  it  then.  I  told  him  I'd", "gotten mugged in Peshawar.<br><br>   \"Of  course,\"  he  said.  Cleared  his\nthroat. \"Are you Muslim?\"<br><br> \"Yes.\"<br><br> \"Practicing?\"<br><br> \"Yes.\" In truth, I didn't remember the\nlast  time  I  had  laid  my  forehead  to\nthe  ground  in  prayer.  Then  I  did\nremember:  the  day  Dr.  Amani  gave\nBaba his prognosis. I had kneeled on\nthe  prayer  rug,  remembering  only\nfragments  of  verses  I  had  learned  in\nschool.<br><br>   \"Helps  your  case  some,  but  not\nmuch,\"  he  said,  scratching  a  spot  on\nthe flawless part in his sandy hair.<br><br>   \"What  do  you  mean?\"  I  asked.  I\nreached  for  Sohrab's  hand,\nintertwined  my  fingers  with  his.\nSohrab looked uncertainly from me to\nAndrews. ", "  \"There's a long answer and I'm sure\nI'll  end  up  giving  it  to  you.  You  want\nthe short one first?\"<br><br> \"I guess,\" I said.<br><br>   Andrews  crushed  his  cigarette,  his\nlips pursed. \"Give it up.\"<br><br> \"I'm sorry?\"<br><br>   \"Your  petition  to  adopt  this  young\nfellow.

He pressed his hands palm\nto palm, as if he were kneeling before\nthe  Virgin  Mary.  \"Let's  assume  the\nstory you gave me is true, though I'd\nbet  my  pension  a  good  deal  of  it  is\neither fabricated or omitted. Not that I", "care,  mind  you.  You're  here,  he's\nhere, that's all that matters. Even so,\nyour  petition  faces  significant\nobstacles,  not  the  least  of  which  is\nthat this child is not an orphan.\"<br><br> \"Of course he is.\"<br><br> \"Not legally he isn't.\"<br><br>   \"His  parents  were  executed  in  the\nstreet.

The  boy  has  to  be\ndeclared a legal orphan.\" ", "  \"But--\"<br><br>   \"You  wanted  the  long  answer  and\nI'm  giving  it  to  you.  Your  next\nproblem  is  that  you  need  the\ncooperation  of  the  child's  country  of\norigin.  Now,  that's  difficult  under  the\nbest  of  circumstances,  and,  to  quote\nyou,  this  is  Afghanistan  we're  talking\nabout.  We  don't  have  an  American\nembassy in Kabul. That makes things\nextremely  complicated.

The way he was looking\nat me, though, we might as well have", "been  talking  about  the  weather.  \"But\nthat  is  not  going  to  make  the  INS\nissue this young fellow a visa.\"<br><br> \"What are you saying?\"<br><br> \"I'm saying that if you want to help,\nsend  money  to  a  reputable  relief\norganization.

Sohrab  slid  next  to  me,\nrested  his  head  on  my  hip.

Andrews was standing in a\nrectangle of sunlight, absently staring\nout the window, his hands turning the\npotted  tomato  plants  toward  the  sun,\npetting them lovingly.<br><br>   \"TAKE  CARE,\"  the  secretary  said\nas we passed her desk.<br><br>   \"Your  boss  could  use  some\nmanners,\"  I  said.  I  expected  her  to\nroll  her  eyes,  maybe  nod  in  that  \"I\nknow,  everybody  says  that,\"  kind  of", "way.  Instead,  she  lowered  her  voice.\n\"Poor Ray.

I could hear Sohrab in there,\nshifting in the tub, spilling water over\nthe sides.<br><br> \"You're going to be great,\" I said.<br><br>   \"Oh,  I  almost  forgot!

His\nbreath  fogged  the  glass,  cleared,\nfogged  it  again.  I  waited  for  him  to\nask  me  about  the  meeting  but  he\ndidn't.<br><br>", " ON THE OTHER SIDE of the closed\nbathroom  door  the  water  was\nrunning. Since the day we'd checked\ninto  the  hotel,  Sohrab  took  a  long\nbath  every  night  before  bed.  In\nKabul,  hot  running  water  had  been\nlike  fathers,  a  rare  commodity.  Now\nSohrab spent almost an hour a night\nin  the  bath,  soaking  in  the  soapy\nwater, scrubbing. Sitting on the edge\nof the bed, I called Soraya. I glanced\nat  the  thin  line  of  light  under  the\nbathroom  door.  Do  you  feel  clean\nyet,  Sohrab?  I  passed  on  to  Soraya\nwhat Raymond Andrews had told me.\n\"So what do you think?\" I said.<br><br> \"We have to think he's wrong.\" She\ntold  me  she  had  called  a  few\nadoption  agencies  that  arranged\ninternational  adoptions.  She  hadn't\nyet  found  one  that  would  consider\ndoing  an  Afghan  adoption,  but  she\nwas still looking.<br><br>   \"How  are  your  parents  taking  the", "news?\"<br><br>   \"Madar  is  happy  for  us.  You  know\nhow  she  feels  about  you,  Amir,  you\ncan do no wrong in her eyes. Padar...\nwell, as always, he's a little harder to\nread. He's not saying much.\"<br><br> \"And you? Are you happy?\"<br><br>   I  heard  her  shifting  the  receiver  to\nher other hand. \"I think we'll be good\nfor your nephew, but maybe that little\nboy will be good for us too.\"<br><br> \"I was thinking the same thing.\"<br><br> Sohrab emerged from the bathroom\na  few  minutes  later.  He  had  barely\nsaid  a  dozen  words  since  the\nmeeting with Raymond Andrews and\nmy attempts at conversation had only\nmet  with  a  nod  or  a  monosyllabic\nreply. He climbed into bed, pulled the\nblanket  to  his  chin.  Within  minutes,\nhe was snoring. ", "    I  wiped  a  circle  on  the  fogged-up\nmirror  and  shaved  with  one  of  the\nhotel's old-fashioned razors, the type\nthat opened and you slid the blade in.\nThen \nI took my own bath, lay there until the\nsteaming  hot  water  turned  cold  and\nmy  skin  shriveled  up.  I  lay  there\ndrifting, wondering, imagining...<br><br>\nOMAR FAISAL WAS CHUBBY, dark,\nhad  dimpled  cheeks,  black  button\neyes,  and  an  affable,  gap-toothed\nsmile. His thinning gray hair was tied\nback  in  a  ponytail.  He  wore  a  brown\ncorduroy  suit  with  leather  elbow\npatches  and  carried  a  worn,\noverstuffed  briefcase.  The  handle\nwas  missing,  so  he  clutched  the\nbriefcase  to  his  chest.  He  was  the\nsort  of  fellow  who  started  a  lot  of\nsentences  with  a  laugh  and  an\nunnecessary  apology,  like  I'm  sorry,\nI'll  be  there  at  five.  Laugh.  When  I\nhad  called  him,  he  had  insisted  on", "coming out to meet us. \"I'm sorry, the\ncabbies  in  this  town  are  sharks,\"  he\nsaid  in  perfect  English,  without  a\ntrace  of  an  accent.  \"They  smell  a\nforeigner, they triple their fares.\"<br><br>   He  pushed  through  the  door,  all\nsmiles  and  apologies,  wheezing  a\nlittle  and  sweating.  He  wiped  his\nbrow with a handkerchief and opened\nhis  briefcase,  rummaged  in  it  for  a\nnotepad  and  apologized  for  the\nsheets  of  paper  that  spilled  on  the\nbed.  Sitting  cross-legged  on  his  bed,\nSohrab  kept  one  eye  on  the  muted\ntelevision,  the  other  on  the  harried\nlawyer. I had told him in the morning\nthat  Faisal  would  be  coming  and  he\nhad  nodded,  almost  asked\nsomething,  and  had  just  gone  on\nwatching a show with talking animals.\n    \"Here  we  are,\"  Faisal  said,  flipping\nopen  a  yellow  legal  notepad.  \"I  hope\nmy  children  take  after  their  mother\nwhen  it  comes  to  organization.  I'm", "sorry,  probably  not  the  sort  of  thing\nyou  want  to  hear  from  your\nprospective  lawyer,  heh?\"  He\nlaughed.<br><br>   \"Well,  Raymond  Andrews  thinks\nhighly of you.\"<br><br> \"He did?\"<br><br>   \"Oh  yes....  So  you're  familiar  with\nmy situation?\"<br><br>   Faisal  dabbed  at  the  sweat  beads\nabove  his  lips.  \"I'm  familiar  with  the\nversion  of  the  situation  you  gave  Mr.\nAndrews,\"  he  said.  His  cheeks\ndimpled  with  a  coy  smile.  He  turned\nto  Sohrab.  \"This  must  be  the  young\nman  who's  causing  all  the  trouble,\"\nhe said in Farsi.<br><br>     \"This  is  Sohrab,\"  I  said.  \"Sohrab,\nthis  is  Mr.  Faisal,  the  lawyer  I  told\nyou about.\"<br><br> Sohrab slid down the side of his bed\nand  shook  hands  with  Omar  Faisal.", "\"Salaam  alaykum,\"  he  said  in  a  low\nvoice.<br><br>   \"Alaykum  salaam,  Sohrab,\"  Faisal\nsaid.  \"Did  you  know  you  are  named\nafter a great warrior?\"<br><br> Sohrab nodded. Climbed back onto\nhis  bed  and  lay  on  his  side  to  watch\nTV.<br><br>   \"I  didn't  know  you  spoke  Farsi  so\nwell,\" I said in English. \"Did you grow\nup in Kabul?\"<br><br> \"No, I was born in Karachi. But I did\nlive  in  Kabul  for  a  number  of  years.\nShar-e-Nau,  near  the  Haji  Yaghoub\nMosque,\"  Faisal  said.  \"I  grew  up  in\nBerkeley,  actually.  My  father  opened\na music store there in the late sixties.\nFree  love,  headbands,  tie-dyed\nshirts,  you  name  it.\"  He  leaned\nforward. \"I was at Woodstock.\"<br><br> \"Groovy,\" I said, and Faisal laughed\nso  hard  he  started  sweating  all  over", "again. \"Anyway,\" I continued, \"what I\ntold Mr. Andrews was pretty much it,\nsave  for  a  thing  or  two.  Or  maybe\nthree.  I'll  give  you  the  uncensored\nversion.\"<br><br>   He  licked  a  finger  and  flipped  to  a\nblank  page,  uncapped  his  pen.  \"I'd\nappreciate  that,  Amir.  And  why  don't\nwe  just  keep  it  in  English  from  here\non out?\"<br><br> \"Fine.\"<br><br>   I  told  him  everything  that  had\nhappened.  Told  him  about  my\nmeeting with Rahim Khan, the trek to\nKabul,  the  orphanage,  the  stoning  at\nGhazi Stadium. <br><br>   \"God,\"  he  whispered.  \"I'm  sorry,  I\nhave  such  fond  memories  of  Kabul.\nHard  to  believe  it's  the  same  place\nyou're telling me about.\"<br><br> \"Have you been there lately?\"<br><br> \"God no.\" ", "  \"It's not Berkeley, I'll tell you that,\" I\nsaid.<br><br> \"Go on.\"<br><br> I told him the rest, the meeting with\nAssef,  the  fight,  Sohrab  and  his\nslingshot,  our  escape  back  to\nPakistan.  When  I  was  done,  he\nscribbled  a  few  notes,  breathed  in\ndeeply,  and  gave  me  a  sober  look.\n\"Well, Amir, you've got a tough battle\nahead of you.\"<br><br> \"One I can win?\"<br><br>   He  capped  his  pen.  \"At  the  risk  of\nsounding like Raymond Andrews, it's\nnot  likely.  Not  impossible,  but  hardly\nlikely.\"  Gone  was  the  affable  smile,\nthe playful look in his eyes.<br><br>   \"But  it's  kids  like  Sohrab  who  need\na  home  the  most,\"  I  said.  \"These\nrules and regulations don't make any\nsense to me.\" ", "    \"You're  preaching  to  the  choir,\nAmir,\"  he  said.  \"But  the  fact  is,  take\ncurrent  immigration  laws,  adoption\nagency  policies,  and  the  political\nsituation in Afghanistan, and the deck\nis stacked against you.\"<br><br> \"I don't get it,\" I said. I wanted to hit\nsomething. \"I mean, I get it but I don't\nget it.\" <br><br>   Omar  nodded,  his  brow  furrowed.\n\"Well, it's like this. In the aftermath of\na  disaster,  whether  it  be  natural  or\nman-made--and  the  Taliban  are  a\ndisaster,  Amir,  believe  me--it's\nalways  difficult  to  ascertain  that  a\nchild is an orphan. Kids get displaced\nin  refugee  camps,  or  parents  just\nabandon  them  because  they  can't\ntake  care  of  them.  Happens  all  the\ntime.  So  the  INS  won't  grant  a  visa\nunless  it's  clear  the  child  meets  the\ndefinition  of  an  eligible  orphan.  I'm\nsorry, I know it sounds ridiculous, but\nyou need death certificates.\" ", "    \"You've  been  to  Afghanistan,\"  I\nsaid. \"You know how improbable that\nis.\"<br><br> \"I know,\" he said. \"But let's suppose\nit's  clear  that  the  child  has  no\nsurviving  parent.  Even  then,  the  INS\nthinks  it's  good  adoption  practice  to\nplace  the  child  with  someone  in  his\nown  country  so  his  heritage  can  be\npreserved.\"<br><br>   \"What  heritage?\"  I  said.  \"The\nTaliban  have  destroyed  what\nheritage Afghans had.<br><br>   You  saw  what  they  did  to  the  giant\nBuddhas in Bamiyan.\"<br><br>   \"I'm  sorry,  I'm  telling  you  how  the\nINS  works,  Amir,\"  Omar  said,\ntouching  my  arm.  He  glanced  at\nSohrab  and  smiled.  Turned  back  to\nme.  \"Now,  a  child  has  to  be  legally\nadopted  according  to  the  laws  and\nregulations  of  his  own  country.  But\nwhen  you  have  a  country  in  turmoil,", "say  a  country  like  Afghanistan,\ngovernment  offices  are  busy  with\nemergencies,  and  processing\nadoptions won't be a top priority.\"<br><br>   I  sighed  and  rubbed  my  eyes.  A\npounding  headache  was  settling  in\njust behind them.<br><br>   \"But  let's  suppose  that  somehow\nAfghanistan  gets  its  act  together,\"\nOmar  said,  crossing  his  arms  on  his\nprotruding  belly.  \"It  still  may  not\npermit this adoption. In fact, even the\nmore  moderate  Muslim  nations  are\nhesitant  with  adoptions  because  in\nmany of those countries, Islamic law,\nShari'a, doesn't recognize adoption.\"<br><br>   \"You're  telling  me  to  give  it  up?\"  I\nasked,  pressing  my  palm  to  my\nforehead.<br><br>     \"I  grew  up  in  the  U.S.,  Amir.  If\nAmerica  taught  me  anything,  it's  that\nquitting  is  right  up  there  with  pissing\nin the Girl Scouts' lemonade jar. But,\nas your lawyer, I have to give you the", "facts,\"  he  said.  \"Finally,  adoption\nagencies  routinely  send  staff\nmembers  to  evaluate  the  child's\nmilieu,  and  no  reasonable  agency  is\ngoing  to  send  an  agent  to\nAfghanistan.\"<br><br>   I  looked  at  Sohrab  sitting  on  the\nbed,  watching  TV,  watching  us.  He\nwas sitting the way his father used to,\nchin resting on one knee.<br><br>   \"I'm  his  half  uncle,  does  that  count\nfor anything?\"<br><br>   \"It  does  if  you  can  prove  it.  I'm\nsorry,  do  you  have  any  papers  or\nanyone who can support you?\"<br><br> \"No papers,\" I said, in a tired voice.\n\"No one knew about it. Sohrab didn't\nknow  until  I  told  him,  and  I  myself\ndidn't find out until recently. The only\nother  person  who  knows  is  gone,\nmaybe dead.\"<br><br> \"What are my options, Omar?\" ", "  \"I'll be frank. You don't have a lot of\nthem.\"<br><br> \"Well, Jesus, what can I do?\"<br><br>   Omar  breathed  in,  tapped  his  chin\nwith the pen, let his breath out. \"You\ncould  still  file  an  orphan  petition,\nhope  for  the  best.  You  could  do  an\nindependent  adoption.  That  means\nyou'd have to live with Sohrab here in\nPakistan,  day  in  and  day  out,  for  the\nnext  two  years.  You  could  seek\nasylum  on  his  behalf.  That's  a\nlengthy  process  and  you'd  have  to\nprove political persecution. You could\nrequest a humanitarian visa. That's at\nthe discretion of the attorney general\nand it's not easily given.\" He paused.\n\"There  is  another  option,  probably\nyour best shot.\"<br><br> \"What?\" I said, leaning forward. <br><br>   \"You  could  relinquish  him  to  an\norphanage  here,  then  file  an  orphan\npetition. ", "    Start  your  I-600  form  and  your\nhome  study  while  he's  in  a  safe\nplace.\"<br><br> \"What are those?\"<br><br>   \"I'm  sorry,  the  I-600  is  an  INS\nformality. The home study is done by\nthe  adoption  agency  you  choose,\"\nOmar  said.  \"It's,  you  know,  to  make\nsure  you  and  your  wife  aren't  raving\nlunatics.\"<br><br>   \"I  don't  want  to  do  that,\"  I  said,\nlooking  again  at  Sohrab.  \"I  promised\nhim  I  wouldn't  send  him  back  to  an\norphanage.\"<br><br>   \"Like  I  said,  it  may  be  your  best\nshot.\"<br><br>   We  talked  a  while  longer.  Then  I\nwalked him out to his car, an old VW\nBug.  The  sun  was  setting  on\nIslamabad  by  then,  a  flaming  red\nnimbus in the west. I watched the car", "tilt  under  Omar's  weight  as  he\nsomehow managed to slide in behind\nthe  wheel.  He  rolled  down  the\nwindow. \"Amir?\"<br><br> \"Yes.\"<br><br>   \"I  meant  to  tell  you  in  there,  about\nwhat  you're  trying  to  do?  I  think  it's\npretty great.\"<br><br>   He  waved  as  he  pulled  away.\nStanding  outside  the  hotel  room  and\nwaving  back,  I  wished  Soraya  could\nbe there with me.<br><br> \nSOHRAB  HAD  TURNED  OFF  THE\nTV when l went back into the room. I\nsat  on  the  edge  of  my  bed,  asked\nhim  to  sit  next  to  me.  \"Mr.  Faisal\nthinks  there  is  a  way  I  can  take  you\nto America with me,\" I said.<br><br>   \"He  does?\"  Sohrab  said,  smiling\nfaintly  for  the  first  time  in  days.\n\"When can we go?\" ", "    \"Well,  that's  the  thing.  It  might  take\na  little  while.  But  he  said  it  can  be\ndone and he's going to help us.\" I put\nmy  hand  on  the  back  of  his  neck.\nFrom  outside,  the  call  to  prayer\nblared through the streets.<br><br> \"How long?\" Sohrab asked.<br><br> \"I don't know. A while.\"<br><br> Sohrab shrugged and smiled, wider\nthis time. \"I don't mind. I can wait. It's\nlike the sour apples.\"<br><br> \"Sour apples?\"<br><br> \"One time, when I was really little, I\nclimbed  a  tree  and  ate  these  green,\nsour  apples.  My  stomach  swelled\nand became hard like a drum, it hurt\na  lot.  Mother  said  that  if  I'd  just\nwaited  for  the  apples  to  ripen,  I\nwouldn't  have  become  sick.  So  now,\nwhenever  I  really  want  something,  I\ntry to remember what she said about", "the apples.\"<br><br>   \"Sour  apples,\"  I  said.  \"Mashallah,\nyou're  just  about  the  smartest  little\nguy  I've  ever  met,  Sohrab  jan.\"  His\nears reddened with a blush.<br><br> \"Will you take me to that red bridge?\nThe one with the fog?\" he said.<br><br> \"Absolutely,\" I said. \"Absolutely.\" <br><br>   \"And  we'll  drive  up  those  streets,\nthe  ones  where  all  you  see  is  the\nhood of the car and the sky?\"<br><br>   \"Every  single  one  of  them,\"  I  said.\nMy  eyes  stung  with  tears  and  I\nblinked them away.<br><br> \"Is English hard to learn?\"<br><br>   \"I  say,  within  a  year,  you'll  speak  it\nas well as Farsi.\"<br><br> \"Really?\"<br><br>   \"Yes.\"  I  placed  a  finger  under  his", "chin,  turned  his  face  up  to  mine.\n\"There is one other thing, Sohrab.\"<br><br> \"What?\"<br><br> \"Well, Mr. Faisal thinks that it would\nreally  help  if  we  could...  if  we  could\nask you to stay in a home for kids for\na while.\"<br><br> \"Home for kids?\" he said, his smile\nfading. \"You mean an orphanage?\"<br><br> \"It would only be for a little while.\"<br><br> \"No,\" he said. \"No, please.\"<br><br>   \"Sohrab,  it  would  be  for  just  a  little\nwhile. I promise.\"<br><br>   \"You  promised  you'd  never  put  me\nin  one  of  those  places,  Amir  agha,\"\nhe said. <br><br>   His  voice  was  breaking,  tears\npooling in his eyes.

And  I'd\nvisit you all the time until we can get\nyou out and take you to America.\"<br><br>   \"Please!  Please,  no!\"  he  croaked.\n\"I'm  scared  of  that  place.  They'll  hurt\nme!

Not that place. God, oh\nGod.  Please,  no!\"  He  was  trembling,\nsnot and tears mixing on his face.<br><br> \"Shhh.\" I pulled him close, wrapped\nmy  arms  around  his  shaking  little\nbody. \"Shhh. It'll be all right. We'll go", "home  together.  You'll  see,  it'll  be  all\nright.\"<br><br>   His  voice  was  muffled  against  my\nchest,  but  I  heard  the  panic  in  it.\n\"Please  promise  you  won't!  Oh  God,\nAmir  agha!  Please  promise  you\nwon't!\"<br><br>   How  could  I  promise?  I  held  him\nagainst  me,  held  him  tightly,  and\nrocked  back  and  forth.  He  wept  into\nmy shirt until his tears dried, until his\nshaking stopped and his frantic pleas\ndwindled to indecipherable mumbles.\nI  waited,  rocked  him  until  his\nbreathing  slowed  and  his  body\nslackened.  I  remembered  something\nI  had  read  somewhere  a  long  time\nago:  That's  how  children  deal  with\nterror. They fall asleep.<br><br>   I  carried  him  to  his  bed,  set  him\ndown.  Then  I  lay  in  my  own  bed,\nlooking  out  the  window  at  the  purple\nsky over Islamabad.<br><br>", "  THE  SKY  WAS  A  DEEP  BLACK\nwhen  the  phone  jolted  me  from\nsleep.

I  picked  up  the\nphone. \"Hello?\"<br><br>   \"Call  from  America.\"  Mr.  Fayyaz's\nbored voice.<br><br>   \"Thank  you,\"  I  said.

A  white\nsheet  spills  over  the  side  of  the\ngurney  and  brushes  against  grimy\ncheckered  tiles.  A  pair  of  small,\nbloody  feet  poke  out  from  under  the\nsheet  and  I  see  that  the  big  toenail\non the left foot is chipped.

I want to scream again, and I\nremember the last time I felt this way,\nriding  with  Baba  in  the  tank  of  the\nfuel truck, buried in the dark with the\nother  refugees.  I  want  to  tear  myself\nfrom  this  place,  from  this  reality  rise\nup  like  a  cloud  and  float  away,  melt\ninto  this  humid  summer  night  and\ndissolve  somewhere  far,  over  the\nhills. But I am here, my legs blocks of\nconcrete,  my  lungs  empty  of  air,  my", "throat  burning.  There  will  be  no\nfloating  away.  There  will  be  no  other\nreality  tonight.  I  close  my  eyes  and\nmy  nostrils  fill  with  the  smells  of  the\ncorridor,  sweat  and  ammonia,\nrubbing  alcohol  and  curry.  On  the\nceiling, moths fling themselves at the\ndull  gray  light  tubes  running  the\nlength  of  the  corridor  and  I  hear  the\npapery flapping of their wings. I hear\nchatter,  muted  sobbing,  sniffling,\nsomeone  moaning,  someone  else\nsighing,  elevator  doors  opening  with\na bing, the operator paging someone\nin Urdu.<br><br>   I  open  my  eyes  again  and  I  know\nwhat  I  have  to  do.  I  look  around,  my\nheart  a  jackhammer  in  my  chest,\nblood thudding in my ears. There is a\ndark little supply room to my left. In it,\nI find what I need. It will do. I grab a\nwhite  bed  sheet  from  the  pile  of\nfolded linens and carry it back to the\ncorridor.  I  see  a  nurse  talking  to  a\npoliceman  near  the  restroom.  I  take\nthe  nurse's  elbow  and  pull,  I  want  to", "know which way is west. She doesn't\nunderstand and the lines on her face\ndeepen  when  she  frowns.  My  throat\naches and my eyes sting with sweat,\neach breath is like inhaling fire, and I\nthink  I  am  weeping.  I  ask  again.  I\nbeg.  The  policeman  is  the  one  who\npoints.<br><br> I throw my makeshift jai-namaz, my\nprayer  rug,  on  the  floor  and  I  get  on\nmy  knees,  lower  my  forehead  to  the\nground, my tears soaking through the\nsheet.  I  bow  to  the  west.  Then  I\nremember  I  haven't  prayed  for  over\nfifteen  years.  I  have  long  forgotten\nthe words. But it doesn't matter, I will\nutter  those  few  words  I  still\nremember:  ??La  iflaha  ii**  Allah,\nMuhammad u rasul ullah. There is no\nGod but Allah and Muhammad is His\nmessenger. I see now that Baba was\nwrong,  there  is  a  God,  there  always\nhad been. I see Him here, in the eyes\nof  the  people  in  this  corridor  of\ndesperation. This is the real house of\nGod,  this  is  where  those  who  have", "lost  God  will  find  Him,  not  the  white\nmasjid  with  its  bright  diamond  lights\nand  towering  minarets.  There  is  a\nGod,  there  has  to  be,  and  now  I  will\npray, I will pray that He forgive that I\nhave  neglected  Him  all  of  these\nyears,  forgive  that  I  have  betrayed,\nlied, and sinned with impunity only to\nturn to Him now in my hour of need, I\npray  that  He  is  as  merciful,\nbenevolent,  and  gracious  as  His\nbook \nsays He is. I bow to the west and kiss\nthe ground and promise that I will do\nzakat,  I  will  do  namaz,  I  will  fast\nduring Ramadan and when Ramadan\nhas  passed  I  will  go  on  fasting,  I  will\ncommit to memory every last word of\nHis  holy  book,  and  I  will  set  on  a\npilgrimage  to  that  sweltering  city  in\nthe desert and bow before the Ka'bah\ntoo. I will do all of this and I will think\nof  Him  every  day  from  this  day  on  if\nHe only grants me this one wish: My\nhands  are  stained  with  Hassan's\nblood; I pray God doesn't let them get\nstained with the blood of his boy too. ", "  I hear a whimpering and realize it is\nmine, my lips are salty with the tears\ntrickling down my face. I feel the eyes\nof  everyone  in  this  corridor  on  me\nand  still  I  bow  to  the  west.  I  pray.  I\npray that my sins have not caught up\nwith  me  the  way  I'd  always  feared\nthey would.<br><br>\nA  STARLESS,  BLACK  NIGHT  falls\nover Islamabad. It's a few hours later\nand I am sitting now on the floor of a\ntiny lounge off the corridor that leads\nto the emergency ward. Before me is\na  dull  brown  coffee  table  cluttered\nwith  newspapers  and  dog-eared\nmagazines--an  April  1996  issue  of\nTime;  a  Pakistani  newspaper\nshowing the face of a young boy who\nwas hit and killed by a train the week\nbefore;  an  entertainment  magazine\nwith  smiling  Hollywood  actors  on  its\nglossy cover. There is an old woman\nwearing  a  jade  green", "shalwar-kameez  and  a  crocheted\nshawl  nodding  off  in  a  wheelchair\nacross  from  me.  Every  once  in  a\nwhile, she stirs awake and mutters a\nprayer  in  Arabic.  I  wonder  tiredly\nwhose  prayers  will  be  heard  tonight,\nhers or mine. I picture Sohrab's face,\nthe  pointed  meaty  chin,  his  small\nseashell  ears,  his  slanting\nbamboo-leaf  eyes  so  much  like  his\nfather's.  A  sorrow  as  black  as  the\nnight  outside  invades  me,  and  I  feel\nmy throat clamping.<br><br> I need air.<br><br> I get up and open the windows. The\nair  coming  through  the  screen  is\nmusty  and  hot--it  smells  of  overripe\ndates  and  dung.  I  force  it  into  my\nlungs  in  big  heaps,  but  it  doesn't\nclear  the  clamping  feeling  in  my\nchest. I drop back on the floor. I pick\nup  the  Time  magazine  and  flip\nthrough  the  pages.  But  I  can't  read,\ncan't  focus  on  anything.  So  I  toss  it\non the table and go back to staring at", "the  zigzagging  pattern  of  the  cracks\non  the  cement  floor,  at  the  cobwebs\non  the  ceiling  where  the  walls  meet,\nat  the  dead  flies  littering  the\nwindowsill. Mostly, I stare at the clock\non the wall. It's just past 4 A.M. and I\nhave  been  shut  out  of  the  room  with\nthe  swinging  double  doors  for  over\nfive  hours  now.  I  still  haven't  heard\nany news.<br><br>  The floor beneath me begins to feel\nlike  part  of  my  body,  and  my\nbreathing  is  growing  heavier,  slower.\nI want to sleep, shut my eyes and lie\nmy  head  down  on  this  cold,  dusty\nfloor.  Drift  off.  When  I  wake  up,\nmaybe I will discover that everything I\nsaw in the hotel bathroom was part of\na  dream:  the  water  drops  dripping\nfrom  the  faucet  and  landing  with  a\nplink  into  the  bloody  bath  water;  the\nleft arm dangling over the side of the\ntub, the blood-soaked razor sitting on\nthe  toilet  tank--the  same  razor  I  had\nshaved  with  the  day  before--and  his\neyes,  still  half  open  but  light  less.\nThat  more  than  anything.  I  want  to", "forget the eyes.<br><br> Soon, sleep comes and I let it take\nme.  I  dream  of  things  I  can't\nremember later.<br><br>\nSOMEONE  IS  TAPPING  ME  on  the\nshoulder. I open my eyes. There is a\nman  kneeling  beside  me.  He  is\nwearing  a  cap  like  the  men  behind\nthe  swinging  double  doors  and  a\npaper  surgical  mask  over  his\nmouth--my  heart  sinks  when  I  see  a\ndrop  of  blood  on  the  mask.  He  has\ntaped  a  picture  of  a  doe-eyed  little\ngirl  to  his  beeper.  He  unsnaps  his\nmask  and  I'm  glad  I  don't  have  to\nlook  at  Sohrab's  blood  anymore.  His\nskin  is  dark  like  the  imported  Swiss\nchocolate  Hassan  and  I  used  to  buy\nfrom  the  bazaar  in  Shar-e-Nau;  he\nhas  thinning  hair  and  hazel  eyes\ntopped  with  curved  eyelashes.  In  a\nBritish  accent,  he  tells  me  his  name\nis Dr. Nawaz, and suddenly I want to", "be  away  from  this  man,  because  I\ndon't think I can bear to hear what he\nhas come to tell me. He says the boy\nhad cut himself deeply and had lost a\ngreat  deal  of  blood  and  my  mouth\nbegins to mutter that prayer again: La\nillaha  il  Allah,  Muhammad  u  rasul\nullah.<br><br> They had to transfuse several units\nof  red  cells--How  will  I  tell  Soraya?\nTwice,  they  had  to  revive  him--I  will\ndo namaz, I will do zakat.<br><br>   They  would  have  lost  him  if  his\nheart  hadn't  been  young  and\nstrong--I will fast.<br><br> He is alive. <br><br>   Dr.  Nawaz  smiles.  It  takes  me  a\nmoment  to  register  what  he  has  just\nsaid.  Then  he  says  more  but  I  don't\nhear  him.  Because  I  have  taken  his\nhands and I have brought them up to\nmy  face.  I  weep  my  relief  into  this\nstranger's small, meaty hands and he\nsays nothing now. He waits. ", " \nTHE  INTENSIVE  CARE  UNIT  is\nL-shaped  and  dim,  a  jumble  of\nbleeping  monitors  and  whirring\nmachines.  Dr.  Nawaz  leads  me\nbetween two rows of beds separated\nby  white  plastic  curtains.  Sohrab's\nbed is the last one around the corner,\nthe  one  nearest  the  nurses'  station\nwhere  two  nurses  in  green  surgical\nscrubs  are  jotting  notes  on\nclipboards, chatting in low voices. On\nthe silent ride up the elevator with Dr.\nNawaz, I had thought I'd weep again\nwhen I saw Sohrab. But when I sit on\nthe  chair  at  the  foot  of  his  bed,\nlooking  at  his  white  face  through  the\ntangle  of  gleaming  plastic  tubes  and\nIV lines, I am dry-eyed. Watching his\nchest  rise  and  fall  to  the  rhythm  of\nthe  hissing  ventilator,  a  curious\nnumbness  washes  over  me,  the\nsame  numbness  a  man  might  feel\nseconds after he has swerved his car\nand  barely  avoided  a  head-on", "collision.<br><br>   I  doze  off,  and,  when  I  wake  up,  I\nsee the sun rising in a buttermilk sky\nthrough  the  window  next  to  the\nnurses'  station.  The  light  slants  into\nthe  room,  aims  my  shadow  toward\nSohrab. He hasn't moved.<br><br> \"You'd do well to get some sleep,\" a\nnurse  says  to  me.  I  don't  recognize\nher--there  must  have  been  a  shift\nchange  while  I'd  napped.  She  takes\nme  to  another  lounge,  this  one  just\noutside  the  ICU.  It's  empty.  She\nhands  me  a  pillow  and  a\nhospital-issue  blanket.  I  thank  her\nand lie on the vinyl sofa in the corner\nof  the  lounge.  I  fall  asleep  almost\nimmediately.<br><br>   I  dream  I  am  back  in  the  lounge\ndownstairs. Dr. Nawaz walks in and I\nrise  to  meet  him.  He  takes  off  his\npaper  mask,  his  hands  suddenly\nwhiter  than  I  remembered,  his  nails\nmanicured, he has neatly parted hair,", "and  I  see  he  is  not  Dr.  Nawaz  at  all\nbut  Raymond  Andrews,  the  little\nembassy  man  with  the  potted\ntomatoes.  Andrews  cocks  his  head.\nNarrows his eyes.<br><br>\nIN THE DAYTIME, the hospital was a\nmaze  of  teeming,  angled  hallways,  a\nblur  of  blazing-white  overhead\nfluorescence.  I  came  to  know  its\nlayout, came to know \nthat the fourth-floor button in the east\nwing  elevator  didn't  light  up,  that  the\ndoor to the men's room on that same\nfloor  was  jammed  and  you  had  to\nram your shoulder into it to open it. I\ncame to know that hospital life has a\nrhythm,  the  flurry  of  activity  just\nbefore  the  morning  shift  change,  the\nmidday hustle, the stillness and quiet\nof  the  late-night  hours  interrupted\noccasionally by a blur of doctors and\nnurses  rushing  to  revive  someone.  I\nkept  vigil  at  Sohrab's  bedside  in  the\ndaytime  and  wandered  through  the", "hospital's  serpentine  corridors  at\nnight,  listening  to  my  shoe  heels\nclicking on the tiles, thinking of what I\nwould  say  to  Sohrab  when  he  woke\nup. I'd end up back in the ICU, by the\nwhooshing  ventilator  beside  his  bed,\nand I'd be no closer to knowing.<br><br>   After  three  days  in  the  ICU,  they\nwithdrew  the  breathing  tube  and\ntransferred  him  to  a  ground-level\nbed. I wasn't there when they moved\nhim. I had gone back to the hotel that\nnight  to  get  some  sleep  and  ended\nup tossing around in bed all night. In\nthe morning, I tried to not look at the\nbathtub.  It  was  clean  now,  someone\nhad  wiped  off  the  blood,  spread  new\nfloor mats on the floor, and scrubbed\nthe  walls.  But  I  couldn't  stop  myself\nfrom  sitting  on  its  cool,  porcelain\nedge.  I  pictured  Sohrab  filling  it  with\nwarm  water.  Saw  him  undressing.\nSaw  him  twisting  the  razor  handle\nand  opening  the  twin  safety  latches\non  the  head,  sliding  the  blade  out,\nholding  it  between  his  thumb  and", "forefinger.  I  pictured  him  lowering\nhimself  into  the  water,  lying  there  for\na  while,  his  eyes  closed.  I  wondered\nwhat his last thought had been as he\nhad  raised  the  blade  and  brought  it\ndown.<br><br>   I  was  exiting  the  lobby  when  the\nhotel  manager,  Mr.  Fayyaz,  caught\nup with me. \"I am very sorry for you,\"\nhe  said,  \"but  I  am  asking  for  you  to\nleave  my  hotel,  please.  This  is  bad\nfor my business, very bad.\"<br><br>   I  told  him  I  understood  and  I\nchecked out. He didn't charge me for\nthe  three  days  I'd  spent  at  the\nhospital.  Waiting  for  a  cab  outside\nthe hotel lobby, I thought about what\nMr. Fayyaz had said to me that night\nwe'd  gone  looking  for  Sohrab:  The\nthing  about  you  Afghanis  is  that...\nwell, you people are a little reckless. I\nhad  laughed  at  him,  but  now  I\nwondered.  Had  I  actually  gone  to\nsleep  after  I  had  given  Sohrab  the\nnews he feared most? When I got in", "the cab, I asked the driver if he knew\nany  Persian  bookstores.  He  said\nthere was one a couple of kilometers\nsouth.  We  stopped  there  on  the  way\nto the hospital.<br><br>\nSOHRAB'S  NEW  ROOM  had\ncream-colored  walls,  chipped,  dark\ngray  moldings,  and  glazed  tiles  that\nmight  have  once  been  white.  He\nshared  the  room  with  a  teenaged\nPunjabi boy who, I later learned from\none of the nurses, had broken his \nleg  when  he  had  slipped  off  the  roof\nof  a  moving  bus.  His  leg  was  in  a\ncast,  raised  and  held  by  tongs\nstrapped to several weights.<br><br>   Sohrab's  bed  was  next  to  the\nwindow,  the  lower  half  lit  by  the\nlate-morning  sunlight  streaming\nthrough  the  rectangular  panes.  A\nuniformed  security  guard  was\nstanding at the window, munching on\ncooked  watermelon  seeds--Sohrab", "was  under  twenty-four  hours-a-day\nsuicide  watch.  Hospital  protocol,  Dr.\nNawaz  had  informed  me.  The  guard\ntipped  his  hat  when  he  saw  me  and\nleft the room.<br><br>   Sohrab  was  wearing  short-sleeved\nhospital  pajamas  and  lying  on  his\nback, blanket pulled to his chest, face\nturned  to  the  window.  I  thought  he\nwas  sleeping,  but  when  I  scooted  a\nchair  up  to  his  bed  his  eyelids\nfluttered  and  opened.  He  looked  at\nme,  then  looked  away.  He  was  so\npale, even with all the blood they had\ngiven  him,  and  there  was  a  large\npurple  bruise  in  the  crease  of  his\nright arm.<br><br> \"How are you?\" I said.<br><br>   He  didn't  answer.  He  was  looking\nthrough  the  window  at  a  fenced-in\nsandbox and swing set in the hospital\ngarden.  There  was  an  arch-shaped\ntrellis  near  the  playground,  in  the\nshadow  of  a  row  of  hibiscus  trees,  a", "few  green  vines  climbing  up  the\ntimber  lattice.  A  handful  of  kids  were\nplaying  with  buckets  and  pails  in  the\nsand  box.  The  sky  was  a  cloudless\nblue  that  day,  and  I  saw  a  tiny  jet\nleaving  behind  twin  white  trails.  I\nturned  back  to  Sohrab.  \"I  spoke  to\nDr. Nawaz a few minutes ago and he\nthinks  you'll  be  discharged  in  a\ncouple  of  days.  That's  good  news,\nnay?\"<br><br>   Again  I  was  met  by  silence.  The\nPunjabi  boy  at  the  other  end  of  the\nroom stirred in his sleep and moaned\nsomething.  \"I  like  your  room,\"  I  said,\ntrying  not  to  look  at  Sohrab's\nbandaged wrists. \"It's bright, and you\nhave  a  view.\"  Silence.  A  few  more\nawkward minutes passed, and a light\nsweat formed on my brow, my upper\nlip. I pointed to the untouched bowl of\ngreen  pea  aush  on  his  nightstand,\nthe  unused  plastic  spoon.  \"You\nshould  try  to  eat  something.  Gain\nyour  quwat  back,  your  strength.  Do\nyou want me to help you?\" ", "    He  held  my  glance,  then  looked\naway,  his  face  set  like  stone.  His\neyes  were  still  lightless,  I  saw,\nvacant,  the  way  I  had  found  them\nwhen  I  had  pulled  him  out  of  the\nbathtub. I reached into the paper bag\nbetween  my  feet  and  took  out  the\nused  copy  of  the  Shah  Namah  I  had\nbought  at  the  Persian  bookstore.  I\nturned  the  cover  so  it  faced  Sohrab.\n\"I  used  to  read  this  to  your  father\nwhen  we  were  children.  We'd  go  up\nthe hill by our house and sit beneath\nthe pomegranate...\" I \ntrailed  off.  Sohrab  was  looking\nthrough the window again. I forced a\nsmile.  \"Your  father's  favorite  was  the\nstory  of  Rostam  and  Sohrab  and\nthat's how you got your name, I know\nyou know that.\" I paused, feeling a bit\nlike an idiot. \"Any way, he said in his\nletter that it was your favorite too, so I\nthought  I'd  read  you  some  of  it.\nWould you like that?\"<br><br>   Sohrab  closed  his  eyes.  Covered", "them  with  his  arm,  the  one  with  the\nbruise.<br><br>   I  flipped  to  the  page  I  had  bent  in\nthe  taxicab.  \"Here  we  go,\"  I  said,\nwondering  for  the  first  time  what\nthoughts  had  passed  through\nHassan's  head  when  he  had  finally\nread  the  Shahnamah  for  himself  and\ndiscovered  that  I  had  deceived  him\nall  those  times.  I  cleared  my  throat\nand  read.  \"Give  ear  unto  the  combat\nof  Sohrab  against  Rostam,  though  it\nbe a tale replete with tears,\" I began.\n\"It  came  about  that  on  a  certain  day\nRostam  rose  from  his  couch  and  his\nmind  was  filled  with  forebodings.  He\nbethought  him...\"  I  read  him  most  of\nchapter  1,  up  to  the  part  where  the\nyoung  warrior  Sohrab  comes  to  his\nmother,  Tahmineh,  the  princess  of\nSamengan,  and  demands  to  know\nthe identity of his father. I closed the\nbook.  \"Do  you  want  me  to  go  on?\nThere  are  battles  coming  up,\nremember?  Sohrab  leading  his  army\nto the White Castle in Iran? Should I", "read on?\"<br><br> He shook his head slowly. I dropped\nthe  book  back  in  the  paper  bag.\n\"That's  fine,\"  I  said,  encouraged  that\nhe  had  responded  at  all.  \"Maybe  we\ncan  continue  tomorrow.  How  do  you\nfeel?\"<br><br>   Sohrab's  mouth  opened  and  a\nhoarse  sound  came  out.  Dr.  Nawaz\nhad  told  me  that  would  happen,  on\naccount  of  the  breathing  tube  they\nhad  slid  through  his  vocal  cords.  He\nlicked his lips and tried again. \"Tired.\"\n  \"I know. Dr. Nawaz said that was to\nbe  expected--\"  He  was  shaking  his\nhead.<br><br> \"What, Sohrab?\"<br><br> He winced when he spoke again in\nthat  husky  voice,  barely  above  a\nwhisper. ", "  \"Tired of everything.\"<br><br>     I  sighed  and  slumped  in  my  chair.\nThere  was  a  band  of  sunlight  on  the\nbed  between  us,  and,  for  just  a\nmoment, the ashen gray face looking\nat me from the other side of it was a\ndead  ringer  for  Hassan's,  not  the\nHassan  I  played  marbles  with  until\nthe  mullah  belted  out  the  evening\nazan and Ali called us home, not the\nHassan I chased down our hill as the\nsun  dipped  behind  clay  rooftops  in\nthe  west,  but  the  Hassan  I  saw  alive\nfor  the  last  time,  dragging  his\nbelongings  behind  Ali  in  a  warm\nsummer  downpour,  stuffing  them  in\nthe  trunk  of  Baba's  car  while  I\nwatched  through  the  rain-soaked\nwindow of my room.<br><br>   He  gave  a  slow  shake  of  his  head.\n\"Tired of everything,\" he repeated.<br><br> \"What can I do, Sohrab? Please tell\nme.\"<br><br>   \"I  want--\"  he  began.  He  winced", "again  and  brought  his  hand  to  his\nthroat  as  if  to  clear  whatever  was\nblocking  his  voice.  My  eyes  were\ndrawn  again  to  his  wrist  wrapped\ntightly  with  white  gauze  bandages.  \"I\nwant my old life back,\" he breathed.<br><br> \"Oh, Sohrab.\"<br><br>   \"I  want  Father  and  Mother  jan.  I\nwant Sasa. I want to play with Rahim\nKhan  sahib  in  the  garden.  I  want  to\nlive in our house again.\" He dragged\nhis  forearm  across  his  eyes.  \"I  want\nmy old life back.\"<br><br> I didn't know what to say, where to\nlook,  so  I  gazed  down  at  my  hands.\nYour  old  life,  I  thought.  My  old  life\ntoo.  I  played  in  the  same  yard,\nSohrab.  I  lived  in  the  same  house.\nBut  the  grass  is  dead  and  a\nstranger's  jeep  is  parked  in  the\ndriveway  of  our  house,  pissing  oil  all\nover the asphalt. Our old life is gone,\nSohrab,  and  everyone  in  it  is  either\ndead  or  dying.  It's  just  you  and  me", "now. Just you and me.<br><br> \"I can't give you that,\" I said.<br><br> \"I wish you hadn't--\" <br><br> \"Please don't say that.\"<br><br> \"--wish you hadn't... I wish you had\nleft me in the water.\"<br><br> \"Don't ever say that, Sohrab,\" I said,\nleaning  forward.  \"I  can't  bear  to  hear\nyou  talk  like  that.\"  I  touched  his\nshoulder  and  he  flinched.  Drew\naway.  I  dropped  my  hand,\nremembering  ruefully  how  in  the  last\ndays before I'd broken my promise to\nhim  he  had  finally  become  at  ease\nwith  my  touch.  \"Sohrab,  I  can't  give\nyou your old life back, I wish to God I\ncould.  But  I  can  take  you  with  me.\nThat  was  what  I  was  coming  in  the\nbathroom to tell you. You have a visa\nto go to America, to live with me and\nmy wife. It's true. I promise.\"<br><br>   He  sighed  through  his  nose  and", "closed  his  eyes.  I  wished  I  hadn't\nsaid  those  last  two  words.  \"You\nknow, I've done a lot of things I regret\nin  my  life,\"  I  said,  \"and  maybe  none\nmore than going back on the promise\nI  made  you.  But  that  will  never\nhappen  again,  and  I  am  so  very\nprofoundly  sorry.  I  ask  for  your\nbakhshesh,  your  forgiveness.  Can\nyou  do  that?  Can  you  forgive  me?\nCan  you  believe  me?\"  I  dropped  my\nvoice. \"Will you come with me?\"<br><br>   As  I  waited  for  his  reply,  my  mind\nflashed  back  to  a  winter  day  from\nlong ago, Hassan and I sitting on the\nsnow  beneath  a  leafless  sour  cherry\ntree.  I  had  played  a  cruel  game  with\nHassan  that  day,  toyed  with  him,\nasked  him  if  he  would  chew  dirt  to\nprove  his  loyalty  to  me.  Now  I  was\nthe  one  under  the  microscope,  the\none who had to prove my worthiness.\nI deserved this.<br><br> Sohrab rolled to his side, his back to\nme. He didn't say anything for a long", "time.  And  then,  just  as  I  thought  he\nmight  have  drifted  to  sleep,  he  said\nwith  a  croak,  \"I  am  so  khasta.\"  So\nvery tired. I sat by his bed until he fell\nasleep.  Something  was  lost  between\nSohrab  and  me.  Until  my  meeting\nwith  the  lawyer,  Omar  Faisal,  a  light\nof hope had begun to enter Sohrab's\neyes like a timid guest. Now the light\nwas  gone,  the  guest  had  fled,  and  I\nwondered  when  it  would  dare  return.\nI  wondered  how  long  before  Sohrab\nsmiled  again.  How  long  before  he\ntrusted me. If ever.<br><br> So I left the room and went looking\nfor  another  hotel,  unaware  that\nalmost  a  year  would  pass  before  I\nwould  hear  Sohrab  speak  another\nword.<br><br>\n  IN  THE  END,  Sohrab  never\naccepted my offer. Nor did he decline\nit.  But  he  knew  that  when  the\nbandages  were  removed  and  the\nhospital  garments  returned,  he  was", "just  another  homeless  Hazara\norphan.  What  choice  did  he  have?\nWhere  could  he  go?  So  what  I  took\nas  a  yes  from  him  was  in  actuality\nmore  of  a  quiet  surrender,  not  so\nmuch  an  acceptance  as  an  act  of\nrelinquishment  by  one  too  weary  to\ndecide,  and  far  too  tired  to  believe.\nWhat he yearned for was his old life.\nWhat  he  got  was  me  and  America.\nNot  that  it  was  such  a  bad  fate,\neverything  considered,  but  I  couldn't\ntell  him  that.  Perspective  was  a\nluxury  when  your  head  was\nconstantly  buzzing  with  a  swarm  of\ndemons.<br><br>   And  so  it  was  that,  about  a  week\nlater,  we  crossed  a  strip  of  warm,\nblack tarmac and I brought Hassan's\nson  from  Afghanistan  to  America,\nlifting him from the certainty of turmoil\nand  dropping  him  in  a  turmoil  of\nuncertainty.<br><br>", "ONE  DAY,  maybe  around  1983  or\n1984,  I  was  at  a  video  store  in\nFremont.  I  was  standing  in  the\nWesterns section when a guy next to\nme,  sipping  Coke  from  a  7-Eleven\ncup,  pointed  to  The  Magnificent\nSeven and asked me if I had seen it.\n\"Yes, thirteen times,\" I said. \"Charles\nBronson  dies  in  it,  so  do  James\nCoburn  and  Robert  Vaughn.\"  He\ngave  me  a  pinch-faced  look,  as  if  I\nhad  just  spat  in  his  soda.  \"Thanks  a\nlot,  man,\"  he  said,  shaking  his  head\nand  muttering  something  as  he\nwalked  away.  That  was  when  I\nlearned  that,  in  America,  you  don't\nreveal the ending of the movie, and if\nyou  do,  you  will  be  scorned  and\nmade  to  apologize  profusely  for\nhaving  committed  the  sin  of  Spoiling\nthe End.<br><br>   In  Afghanistan,  the  ending  was  all\nthat  mattered.  When  Hassan  and  I\ncame  home  after  watching  a  Hindi\nfilm  at  Cinema  Zainab,  what  Ali,\nRahim  Khan,  Baba,  or  the  myriad  of", "Baba's  friends--second  and  third\ncousins  milling  in  and  out  of  the\nhouse--wanted to know was this: Did\nthe  Girl  in  the  film  find  happiness?\nDid  the  bacheh  film,  the  Guy  in  the\nfilm,  become  katnyab  and  fulfill  his\ndreams, or was he nah-kam, doomed\nto  wallow  in  failure?  Was  there\nhappiness at the end, they wanted to\nknow.<br><br>   If  someone  were  to  ask  me  today\nwhether the story of Hassan, Sohrab,\nand  me  ends  with  happiness,  I\nwouldn't know what to say. <br><br> Does anybody's? After all, life is not\na  Hindi  movie.  Zendagi  migzara,\nAfghans  like  to  say:  Life  goes  on,\nunmindful of beginning, end, kamyab,\nnah-kam,  crisis  or  catharsis,  moving\nforward like a slow, dusty caravan of\nkochis.<br><br> I wouldn't know how to answer that\nquestion.  Despite  the  matter  of  last\nSunday's tiny miracle. ", " \nWE  ARRIVED  HOME  about  seven\nmonths  ago,  on  a  warm  day  in\nAugust 2001. Soraya picked us up at\nthe  airport.  I  had  never  been  away\nfrom  Soraya  for  so  long,  and  when\nshe  locked  her  arms  around  my\nneck,  when  I  smelled  apples  in  her\nhair,  I  realized  how  much  I  had\nmissed  her.  \"You're  still  the  morning\nsun to my yelda,\" I whispered.<br><br> \"What?\"<br><br> \"Never mind.\" I kissed her ear.<br><br>   After,  she  knelt  to  eye  level  with\nSohrab.  She  took  his  hand  and\nsmiled at him.<br><br> \"Salaam, Sohrab jan, I'm your Khala\nSoraya.  We've  all  been  waiting  for\nyou.\"<br><br>   Looking  at  her  smiling  at  Sohrab,\nher  eyes  tearing  over  a  little,  I  had  a", "glimpse  of  the  mother  she  might\nhave  been,  had  her  own  womb  not\nbetrayed her.<br><br>   Sohrab  shifted  on  his  feet  and\nlooked away.<br><br> \nSORAYA  HAD  TURNED  THE\nSTUDY  upstairs  into  a  bedroom  for\nSohrab. She led him in and he sat on\nthe  edge  of  the  bed.  The  sheets\nshowed brightly colored kites flying in\nindigo  blue  skies.  She  had  made\ninscriptions on the wall by the closet,\nfeet  and  inches  to  measure  a  child's\ngrowing height. At the foot of the bed,\nI  saw  a  wicker  basket  stuffed  with\nbooks,  a  locomotive,  a  water  color\nset.<br><br> Sohrab was wearing the plain white\nT-shirt and new denims I had bought\nhim  in  Islamabad  just  before  we'd\nleft--the  shirt  hung  loosely  over  his\nbony,  slumping  shoulders.  The  color\nstill hadn't seeped back into his face,", "save  for  the  halo  of  dark  circles\naround  his  eyes.  He  was  looking  at\nus  now  in  the  impassive  way  he\nlooked at the plates of boiled rice the\nhospital orderly placed before him.<br><br>   Soraya  asked  if  he  liked  his  room\nand  I  noticed  that  she  was  trying  to\navoid  looking  at  his  wrists  and  that\nher eyes kept swaying back to those\njagged pink lines. Sohrab lowered his\nhead. Hid his hands under his thighs\nand said nothing.<br><br> Then he simply lay his head on the\npillow.  Less  than  five  minutes  later,\nSoraya  and  I  watching  from  the\ndoorway, he was snoring.<br><br>   We  went  to  bed,  and  Soraya  fell\nasleep with her head on my chest. In\nthe  darkness  of  our  room,  I  lay\nawake,  an  insomniac  once  more.\nAwake.  And  alone  with  demons  of\nmy  own.  Sometime  in  the  middle  of\nthe night, I slid out of bed and went to\nSohrab's  room.  I  stood  over  him,", "looking  down,  and  saw  something\nprotruding  from  under  his  pillow.  I\npicked  it  up.  Saw  it  was  Rahim\nKhan's  Polaroid,  the  one  I  had  given\nto Sohrab the night we had sat by the\nShah  Faisal  Mosque.  The  one  of\nHassan and Sohrab standing side by\nside, squinting in the light of the sun,\nand smiling like the world was a good\nand  just  place.  I  wondered  how  long\nSohrab had lain in bed staring at the\nphoto, turning it in his hands.<br><br>   I  looked  at  the  photo.  Your  father\nwas a man torn between two halves,\nRahim  Khan  had  said  in  his  letter.  I\nhad  been  the  entitled  half,  the\nsociety-approved,  legitimate  half,  the\nunwitting embodiment of Baba's guilt.\nI  looked  at  Hassan,  showing  those\ntwo  missing  front  teeth,  sunlight\nslanting  on  his  face.  Baba's  other\nhalf. The unentitled, unprivileged half.\nThe half who had inherited what had\nbeen  pure  and  noble  in  Baba.  The\nhalf  that,  maybe,  in  the  most  secret\nrecesses  of  his  heart,  Baba  had", "thought of as his true son.<br><br>   I  slipped  the  picture  back  where  I\nhad  found  it.  Then  I  realized\nsomething:  That  last  thought  had\nbrought  no  sting  with  it.  Closing\nSohrab's door, I wondered if that was\nhow forgiveness budded, not with the\nfanfare of epiphany, but with \npain gathering its things, packing up,\nand  slipping  away  unannounced  in\nthe middle of the night.<br><br>\nTHE  GENERAL  AND  KHALA\nJAMILA  came  over  for  dinner  the\nfollowing night. Khala Jamila, her hair\ncut  short  and  a  darker  shade  of  red\nthan  usual,  handed  Soraya  the  plate\nof  almond-topped  maghout  she  had\nbrought for dessert. She saw Sohrab\nand  beamed.  \"Mashallah!\"  Soraya\njan told us how khoshteep you were,\nbut  you  are  even  more  handsome  in\nperson, Sohrab jan.\" She handed him\na  blue  turtleneck  sweater.  \"I  knitted", "this  for  you,\"  she  said.  \"For  next\nwinter. Inshallah, it will fit you.\"<br><br> Sohrab took the sweater from her.<br><br>   \"Hello,  young  man,\"  was  all  the\ngeneral said, leaning with both hands\non  his  cane,  looking  at  Sohrab  the\nway  one  might  study  a  bizarre\ndecorative item at someone's house.<br><br>   I  answered,  and  answered  again,\nKhala  Jamila's  questions  about  my\ninjuries--I'd asked Soraya to tell them\nI  had  been  mugged--reassuring  her\nthat  I  had  no  permanent  damage,\nthat  the  wires  would  come  out  in  a\nfew  weeks  so  I'd  be  able  to  eat  her\ncooking  again,  that,  yes,  I  would  try\nrubbing  rhubarb  juice  and  sugar  on\nmy scars to make them fade faster.<br><br>   The  general  and  I  sat  in  the  living\nroom  and  sipped  wine  while  Soraya\nand  her  mother  set  the  table.  I  told\nhim about Kabul and the Taliban. He\nlistened and nodded, his cane on his", "lap, and tsk'ed when I told him of the\nman I had spotted selling his artificial\nleg.  I  made  no  mention  of  the\nexecutions  at  Ghazi  Stadium  and\nAssef.  He  asked  about  Rahim  Khan,\nwhom he said he had met in Kabul a\nfew  times,  and  shook  his  head\nsolemnly  when  I  told  him  of  Rahim\nKhan's  illness.  But  as  we  spoke,  I\ncaught  his  eyes  drifting  again  and\nagain  to  Sohrab  sleeping  on  the\ncouch.  As  if  we  were  skirting  around\nthe edge of what he really wanted to\nknow.<br><br>   The  skirting  finally  came  to  an  end\nover  dinner  when  the  general  put\ndown his fork and said, \"So, Amir jan,\nyou're  going  to  tell  us  why  you  have\nbrought back this boy with you?\" <br><br>   \"Iqbal  jan!  What  sort  of  question  is\nthat?\" Khala Jamila said.<br><br>   \"While  you're  busy  knitting\nsweaters,  my  dear,  I  have  to  deal\nwith  the  community's  perception  of\nour  family.  People  will  ask.  They  will", "want  to  know  why  there  is  a  Hazara\nboy living with our daughter. What do\nI tell them?\"<br><br> Soraya dropped her spoon. Turned\non her father. \"You can tell them--\"<br><br> \"It's okay, Soraya,\" I said, taking her\nhand.  \"It's  okay.  General  Sahib  is\nquite right. People will ask.\"<br><br> \"Amir--\" she began.<br><br> \"It's all right.\" I turned to the general.\n\"You  see,  General  Sahib,  my  father\nslept with his servant's wife. She bore\nhim a son named Hassan. Hassan is\ndead  now.  That  boy  sleeping  on  the\ncouch  is  Hassan's  son.  He's  my\nnephew.  That's  what  you  tell  people\nwhen they ask.\"<br><br> They were all staring at me.<br><br>   \"And  one  more  thing,  General\nSahib,\"  I  said.  \"You  will  never  again\nrefer  to  him  as  'Hazara  boy'  in  my", "presence.  He  has  a  name  and  it's\nSohrab.\"<br><br>   No  one  said  anything  for  the\nremainder of the meal.<br><br>\nIT  WOULD  BE  ERRONEOUS  to  say\nSohrab  was  quiet.  Quiet  is  peace.\nTranquillity.<br><br> Quiet is turning down the VOLUME\nknob on life.<br><br>   Silence  is  pushing  the  OFF  button.\nShutting it down. All of it.<br><br>     Sohrab's  silence  wasn't  the\nself-imposed  silence  of  those  with\nconvictions,  of  protesters  who  seek\nto speak their cause by not speaking\nat  all.  It  was  the  silence  of  one  who\nhas  taken  cover  in  a  dark  place,\ncurled  up  all  the  edges  and  tucked\nthem under.<br><br>   He  didn't  so  much  live  with  us  as", "occupy  space.  And  precious  little  of\nit. Sometimes, at the market, or in the\npark,  I'd  notice  how  other  people\nhardly  seemed  to  even  see  him,  like\nhe wasn't there at all. I'd look up from\na  book  and  realize  Sohrab  had\nentered  the  room,  had  sat  across\nfrom  me,  and  I  hadn't  noticed.  He\nwalked  like  he  was  afraid  to  leave\nbehind footprints. He moved as if not\nto  stir  the  air  around  him.  Mostly,  he\nslept.<br><br>   Sohrab's  silence  was  hard  on\nSoraya  too.  Over  that  long-distance\nline  to  Pakistan,  Soraya  had  told  me\nabout the things she was planning for\nSohrab.  Swimming  classes.  Soccer.\nBowling league. Now she'd walk past\nSohrab's  room  and  catch  a  glimpse\nof  books  sitting  unopened  in  the\nwicker  basket,  the  growth  chart\nunmarked,  the  jigsaw  puzzle\nunassembled,  each  item  a  reminder\nof  a  life  that  could  have  been.  A\nreminder  of  a  dream  that  was  wilting\neven  as  it  was  budding.  But  she", "hadn't  been  alone.  I'd  had  my  own\ndreams for Sohrab.<br><br>   While  Sohrab  was  silent,  the  world\nwas  not.  One  Tuesday  morning  last\nSeptember,  the  Twin  Towers  came\ncrumbling  down  and,  overnight,  the\nworld  changed.  The  American  flag\nsuddenly  appeared  everywhere,  on\nthe antennae of yellow cabs weaving\naround  traffic,  on  the  lapels  of\npedestrians  walking  the  sidewalks  in\na  steady  stream,  even  on  the  grimy\ncaps of San Francisco's pan handlers\nsitting  beneath  the  awnings  of  small\nart galleries and open-fronted shops.\nOne  day  I  passed  Edith,  the\nhomeless  woman  who  plays  the\naccordion every day on the corner of\nSutter  and  Stockton,  and  spotted  an\nAmerican  flag  sticker  on  the\naccordion case at her feet.<br><br>   Soon  after  the  attacks,  America\nbombed  Afghanistan,  the  Northern\nAlliance  moved  in,  and  the  Taliban\nscurried  like  rats  into  the  caves.", "Suddenly,  people  were  standing  in\ngrocery  store  lines  and  talking  about\nthe cities of my childhood, Kandahar,\nHerat,  Mazar-i-Sharif.  When  I  was\nvery little, Baba took Hassan and me\nto  Kunduz.  I  don't  remember  much\nabout  the  trip,  except  sitting  in  the\nshade  of  an  acacia  tree  with  Baba\nand  Hassan,  taking  turns  sipping\nfresh  watermelon  juice  from  a  clay\npot  and  seeing  who  could  spit  the\nseeds farther. Now Dan Rather, Tom\nBrokaw,  and  people  sipping  lattes  at\nStarbucks  were  talking  about  the\nbattle  for  Kunduz,  the  Taliban's  last\nstronghold  in  the  north.  That\nDecember,  Pashtuns,  Tajiks,\nUzbeks,  and  Hazaras  gathered  in\nBonn  and,  under  the  watchful  eye  of\nthe UN, began the process that might\nsomeday end \nover  twenty  years  of  unhappiness  in\ntheir  watan.  Hamid  Karzai's  caracul\nhat  and  green  chapan  became\nfamous.<br><br> Sohrab sleepwalked through it all. ", "    Soraya  and  I  became  involved  in\nAfghan  projects,  as  much  out  of  a\nsense  of  civil  duty  as  the  need  for\nsomething--anything--to  fill  the\nsilence  upstairs,  the  silence  that\nsucked  everything  in  like  a  black\nhole.  I  had  never  been  the  active\ntype  before,  but  when  a  man  named\nKabir,  a  former  Afghan  ambassador\nto Sofia, called and asked if I wanted\nto  help  him  with  a  hospital  project,  I\nsaid  yes.  The  small  hospital  had\nstood  near  the  Afghan-Pakistani\nborder  and  had  a  small  surgical  unit\nthat  treated  Afghan  refugees  with\nland  mine  injuries.  But  it  had  closed\ndown  due  to  a  lack  of  funds.  I\nbecame the project manager, Soraya\nmy  co-manager.  I  spent  most  of  my\ndays  in  the  study,  e-mailing  people\naround the world, applying for grants,\norganizing  fund-raising  events.  And\ntelling  myself  that  bringing  Sohrab\nhere had been the right thing to do.<br><br>   The  year  ended  with  Soraya  and", "me  on  the  couch,  blanket  spread\nover our legs, watching Dick Clark on\nTV. People cheered and kissed when\nthe  silver  ball  dropped,  and  confetti\nwhitened  the  screen.  In  our  house,\nthe  new  year  began  much  the  same\nway  the  last  one  had  ended.  In\nsilence.<br><br>\nTHEN, FOUR DAYS AGO, on a cool\nrainy  day  in  March  2002,  a  small,\nwondrous thing happened.<br><br>   I  took  Soraya,  Khala  Jamila,  and\nSohrab  to  a  gathering  of  Afghans  at\nLake Elizabeth Park in Fremont. The\ngeneral  had  finally  been  summoned\nto Afghanistan the month before for a\nministry position, and had flown there\ntwo weeks earlier--he had left behind\nhis  gray  suit  and  pocket  watch.  The\nplan was for Khala Jamila to join him\nin a few months once he had settled.\nShe missed him terribly--and worried\nabout  his  health  there--and  we  had", "insisted she stay with us for a while.<br><br> The previous Thursday, the first day\nof  spring,  had  been  the  Afghan  New\nYear's  Day--the  Sawl-e-Nau--and\nAfghans in the Bay Area had planned\ncelebrations throughout the East Bay\nand  the  peninsula.  Kabir,  Soraya,\nand  I  had  an  additional  reason  to\nrejoice:  Our  little  hospital  in\nRawalpindi had opened the \nweek  before,  not  the  surgical  unit,\njust  the  pediatric  clinic.  But  it  was  a\ngood start, we all agreed.<br><br>   It  had  been  sunny  for  days,  but\nSunday morning, as I swung my legs\nout  of  bed,  I  heard  raindrops  pelting\nthe  window.  Afghan  luck,  I  thought.\nSnickered.  I  prayed  morning  namaz\nwhile  Soraya  slept--I  didn't  have  to\nconsult  the  prayer  pamphlet  I  had\nobtained  from  the  mosque  anymore;\nthe  verses  came  naturally  now,\neffortlessly.<br><br> We arrived around noon and found", "a  handful  of  people  taking  cover\nunder  a  large  rectangular  plastic\nsheet mounted on six poles spiked to\nthe  ground.  Someone  was  already\nfrying  bolani;  steam  rose  from\nteacups  and  a  pot  of  cauliflower\naush.  A  scratchy  old  Ahmad  Zahir\nsong  was  blaring  from  a  cassette\nplayer.  I  smiled  a  little  as  the  four  of\nus  rushed  across  the  soggy  grass\nfield, Soraya and I in the lead, Khala\nJamila  in  the  middle,  Sohrab  behind\nus,  the  hood  of  his  yellow  raincoat\nbouncing on his back.<br><br>   \"What's  so  funny?\"  Soraya  said,\nholding  a  folded  newspaper  over  her\nhead.<br><br>   \"You  can  take  Afghans  out  of\nPaghman,  but  you  can't  take\nPaghman out of Afghans,\" I said.<br><br>   We  stooped  under  the  makeshift\ntent. Soraya and Khala Jamila drifted\ntoward  an  overweight  woman  frying\nspinach  bolani.  Sohrab  stayed  under", "the  canopy  for  a  moment,  then\nstepped back out into the rain, hands\nstuffed in the pockets of his raincoat,\nhis  hair--now  brown  and  straight  like\nHassan's--plastered  against  his\nscalp.  He  stopped  near  a\ncoffee-colored  puddle  and  stared  at\nit.  No  one  seemed  to  notice.  No  one\ncalled  him  back  in.  With  time,  the\nqueries  about  our  adopted--and\ndecidedly  eccentric--little  boy  had\nmercifully  ceased,  and,  considering\nhow  tactless  Afghan  queries  can  be\nsometimes,  that  was  a  considerable\nrelief. People stopped asking why he\nnever spoke. Why he didn't play with\nthe  other  kids.  And  best  of  all,  they\nstopped  suffocating  us  with  their\nexaggerated  empathy,  their  slow\nhead shaking, their tsk tsks, their \"Oh\ngung  bichara.\"  Oh,  poor  little  mute\none.  The  novelty  had  worn  off.  Like\ndull  wallpaper,  Sohrab  had  blended\ninto the background.<br><br>   I  shook  hands  with  Kabir,  a  small,\nsilver-haired  man.  He  introduced  me", "to  a  dozen  men,  one  of  them  a\nretired  teacher,  another  an  engineer,\na  former  architect,  a  surgeon  who\nwas  now  running  a  hot  dog  stand  in\nHayward. They all said they'd known\nBaba in Kabul, and they spoke about\nhim respectfully. In one \nway  or  another,  he  had  touched  all\ntheir lives. The men said I was lucky\nto  have  had  such  a  great  man  for  a\nfather.<br><br>   We  chatted  about  the  difficult  and\nmaybe  thankless  job  Karzai  had  in\nfront  of  him,  about  the  upcoming\nLoya  jirga,  and  the  king's  imminent\nreturn  to  his  homeland  after\ntwenty-eight  years  of  exile.  I\nremembered  the  night  in  1973,  the\nnight  Zahir  Shah's  cousin  overthrew\nhim;  I  remembered  gunfire  and  the\nsky  lighting  up  silver--Ali  had  taken\nme  and  Hassan  in  his  arms,  told  us\nnot  to  be  afraid,  that  they  were  just\nshooting ducks.<br><br>   Then  someone  told  a  Mullah", "Nasruddin  joke  and  we  were  all\nlaughing. \"You know, your father was\na funny man too,\" Kabir said.<br><br> \"He was, wasn't he?\" I said, smiling,\nremembering  how,  soon  after  we\narrived  in  the  U.S.,  Baba  started\ngrumbling about American flies. He'd\nsit  at  the  kitchen  table  with  his\nflyswatter,  watch  the  flies  darting\nfrom  wall  to  wall,  buzzing  here,\nbuzzing  there,  harried  and  rushed.\n\"In  this  country,  even  flies  are\npressed  for  time,\"  he'd  groan.  How  I\nhad laughed. I smiled at the memory\nnow.<br><br>   By  three  o'clock,  the  rain  had\nstopped  and  the  sky  was  a  curdled\ngray  burdened  with  lumps  of  clouds.\nA cool breeze blew through the park.\nMore  families  turned  up.  Afghans\ngreeted  each  other,  hugged,  kissed,\nexchanged  food.  Someone  lighted\ncoal  in  a  barbecue  and  soon  the\nsmell  of  garlic  and  morgh  kabob\nflooded  my  senses.  There  was", "music,  some  new  singer  I  didn't\nknow,  and  the  giggling  of  children.  I\nsaw  Sohrab,  still  in  his  yellow\nraincoat,  leaning  against  a  garbage\npail,  staring  across  the  park  at  the\nempty batting cage.<br><br> A little while later, as I was chatting\nwith the former surgeon, who told me\nhe and Baba had been classmates in\neighth  grade,  Soraya  pulled  on  my\nsleeve. \"Amir, look!\"<br><br>   She  was  pointing  to  the  sky.  A\nhalf-dozen  kites  were  flying  high,\nspeckles  of  bright  yellow,  red,  and\ngreen against the gray sky.<br><br> \"Check it out,\" Soraya said, and this\ntime she was pointing to a guy selling\nkites from a stand nearby. <br><br> \"Hold this,\" I said. I gave my cup of\ntea  to  Soraya.  I  excused  myself  and\nwalked  over  to  the  kite  stand,  my\nshoes  squishing  on  the  wet  grass.  I\npointed  to  a  yellow  seh-parcha.\n\"Sawl-e-Nau  mubabrak,\"  the  kite", "seller  said,  taking  the  twenty  and\nhanding  me  the  kite  and  a  wooden\nspool of glass tar. I thanked him and\nwished him a Happy New Year too. I\ntested the string the way Hassan and\nI  used  to,  by  holding  it  between  my\nthumb and forefinger and pulling it. It\nreddened  with  blood  and  the  kite\nseller smiled. I smiled back.<br><br> I took the kite to where Sohrab was\nstanding,  still  leaning  against  the\ngarbage  pail,  arms  crossed  on  his\nchest. He was looking up at the sky.<br><br>   \"Do  you  like  the  seh-parcha?\"  I\nsaid,  holding  up  the  kite  by  the  ends\nof  the  cross  bars.  His  eyes  shifted\nfrom  the  sky  to  me,  to  the  kite,  then\nback.  A  few  rivulets  of  rain  trickled\nfrom his hair, down his face.<br><br>   \"I  read  once  that,  in  Malaysia,  they\nuse kites to catch fish,\" I said. \"I'll bet\nyou  didn't  know  that.  They  tie  a\nfishing  line  to  it  and  fly  it  beyond  the\nshallow  waters,  so  it  doesn't  cast  a", "shadow  and  scare  the  fish.  And  in\nancient  China,  generals  used  to  fly\nkites  over  battlefields  to  send\nmessages  to  their  men.  It's  true.  I'm\nnot  slipping  you  a  trick.\"  I  showed\nhim  my  bloody  thumb.  \"Nothing\nwrong with the tar either.\"<br><br>   Out  of  the  corner  of  my  eye,  I  saw\nSoraya  watching  us  from  the  tent.\nHands  tensely  dug  in  her  armpits.\nUnlike  me,  she'd  gradually\nabandoned her attempts at engaging\nhim.  The  unanswered  questions,  the\nblank  stares,  the  silence,  it  was  all\ntoo  painful.  She  had  shifted  to\n\"Holding Pattern,\" waiting for a green\nlight from Sohrab. Waiting.<br><br> I wet my index finger and held it up.\n\"I  remember  the  way  your  father\nchecked the wind was to kick up dust\nwith  his  sandal,  see  which  way  the\nwind  blew  it.  He  knew  a  lot  of  little\ntricks  like  that,\"  I  said.  Lowered  my\nfinger. \"West, I think.\" ", "    Sohrab  wiped  a  raindrop  from  his\nearlobe  and  shifted  on  his  feet.  Said\nnothing.  I  thought  of  Soraya  asking\nme a few months ago what his voice\nsounded  like.  I'd  told  her  I  didn't\nremember anymore. <br><br>   \"Did  I  ever  tell  you  your  father  was\nthe  best  kite  runner  in  Wazir  Akbar\nKhan?  Maybe  all  of  Kabul?\"  I  said,\nknotting  the  loose  end  of  the  spool\ntar to the string loop tied to the center\nspar.  \"How  jealous  he  made  the\nneighborhood kids.<br><br> He'd run kites and never look up at\nthe  sky,  and  people  used  to  say  he\nwas  chasing  the  kite's  shadow.  But\nthey  didn't  know  him  like  I  did.  Your\nfather  wasn't  chasing  any  shadows.\nHe  just...  knew\"  Another  half-dozen\nkites  had  taken  flight.  People  had\nstarted  to  gather  in  clumps,  teacups\nin hand, eyes glued to the sky.<br><br> \"Do you want to help me fly this?\" I\nsaid. ", "    Sohrab's  gaze  bounced  from  the\nkite to me. Back to the sky.<br><br>   \"Okay.\"  I  shrugged.  \"Looks  like  I'll\nhave to fly it tanhaii.\" Solo.<br><br> I balanced the spool in my left hand\nand  fed  about  three  feet  of  tar.  The\nyellow  kite  dangled  at  the  end  of  it,\njust  above  the  wet  grass.  \"Last\nchance,\"  I  said.  But  Sohrab  was\nlooking at a pair of kites tangling high\nabove the trees.<br><br>   \"All  right.  Here  I  go.\"  I  took  off\nrunning,  my  sneakers  splashing\nrainwater  from  puddles,  the  hand\nclutching  the  kite  end  of  the  string\nheld  high  above  my  head.  It  had\nbeen  so  long,  so  many  years  since\nI'd  done  this,  and  I  wondered  if  I'd\nmake  a  spectacle  of  myself.  I  let  the\nspool roll in my left hand as I ran, felt\nthe string cut my right hand again as\nit  fed  through.  The  kite  was  lifting\nbehind  my  shoulder  now,  lifting,\nwheeling, and I ran harder. The spool", "spun  faster  and  the  glass  string  tore\nanother  gash  in  my  right  palm.  I\nstopped  and  turned.  Looked  up.\nSmiled.  High  above,  my  kite  was\ntilting  side  to  side  like  a  pendulum,\nmaking  that  old\npaper-bird-flapping-its-wings  sound  I\nalways  associated  with  winter\nmornings  in  Kabul.  I  hadn't  flown  a\nkite  in  a  quarter  of  a  century,  but\nsuddenly  I  was  twelve  again  and  all\nthe old instincts came rushing back.<br><br>   I  felt  a  presence  next  to  me  and\nlooked  down.  It  was  Sohrab.  Hands\ndug  deep  in  the  pockets  of  his\nraincoat. He had followed me.<br><br>   \"Do  you  want  to  try?\"  I  asked.  He\nsaid  nothing.  But  when  I  held  the\nstring out for him, his hand lifted from\nhis  pocket.  Hesitated.  Took  the\nstring.  My  heart  quickened  as  I  spun\nthe  spool  to  gather  the  loose  string.\nWe stood quietly side by side. Necks\nbent up.<br><br>  Around us, kids chased each other,", "slid  on  the  grass.  Someone  was\nplaying  an  old  Hindi  movie\nsoundtrack now. A line of elderly men\nwere  praying  afternoon  namaz  on  a\nplastic  sheet  spread  on  the  ground.\nThe air smelled of wet grass, smoke,\nand grilled meat. I wished time would\nstand still.<br><br>   Then  I  saw  we  had  company.  A\ngreen kite was closing in. I traced the\nstring  to  a  kid  standing  about  thirty\nyards from us. He had a crew cut and\na  T-shirt  that  read  THE  ROCK\nRULES  in  bold  block  letters.  He  saw\nme  looking  at  him  and  smiled.\nWaved. I waved back.<br><br> Sohrab was handing the string back\nto me.<br><br> \"Are you sure?\" I said, taking it.<br><br> He took the spool from me.<br><br>   \"Okay,\"  I  said.  \"Let's  give  him  a\nsabagh,  teach  him  a  lesson,  nay?\"  I", "glanced  over  at  him.  The  glassy,\nvacant look in his eyes was gone. His\ngaze  flitted  between  our  kite  and  the\ngreen  one.  His  face  was  a  little\nflushed,  his  eyes  suddenly  alert.\nAwake. Alive. I wondered when I had\nforgotten  that,  despite  everything,  he\nwas still just a child.<br><br>   The  green  kite  was  making  its\nmove.  \"Let's  wait,\"  I  said.  \"We'll  let\nhim get a little closer.\" It dipped twice\nand  crept  toward  us.  \"Come  on.\nCome to me,\" I said.<br><br> The green kite drew closer yet, now\nrising  a  little  above  us,  unaware  of\nthe trap I'd set for it. \"Watch, Sohrab.\nI'm  going  to  show  you  one  of  your\nfather's  favorite  tricks,  the  old\nlift-and-dive.\"<br><br>   Next  to  me,  Sohrab  was  breathing\nrapidly  through  his  nose.  The  spool\nrolled in his palms, the tendons in his\nscarred  wrists  like  rubab  strings.\nThen  I  blinked  and,  for  just  a", "moment, the hands holding the spool\nwere  the  chipped-nailed,  calloused\nhands of a harelipped boy. I heard a\ncrow  cawing  somewhere  and  I\nlooked  up.  The  park  shimmered  with\nsnow  so  fresh,  so  dazzling  white,  it\nburned  my  eyes.  It  sprinkled\nsoundlessly  from  the  branches  of\nwhite-clad trees. I \nsmelled  turnip  qurina  now.  Dried\nmulberries.  Sour  oranges.  Sawdust\nand  walnuts.  The  muffled  quiet,\nsnow-quiet,  was  deafening.  Then  far\naway,  across  the  stillness,  a  voice\ncalling  us  home,  the  voice  of  a  man\nwho dragged his right leg.<br><br>   The  green  kite  hovered  directly\nabove  us  now.  \"He's  going  for  it.\nAnytime now,\" I said, my eyes flicking\nfrom Sohrab to our kite.<br><br>   The  green  kite  hesitated.  Held\nposition.  Then  shot  down.  \"Here  he\ncomes!\" I said.<br><br>   I  did  it  perfectly.  After  all  these", "years.  The  old  lift-and-dive  trap.  I\nloosened  my  grip  and  tugged  on  the\nstring, dipping and dodging the green\nkite.  A  series  of  quick  sidearm  jerks\nand  our  kite  shot  up\ncounterclockwise,  in  a  half  circle.\nSuddenly  I  was  on  top.  The  green\nkite  was  scrambling  now,\npanic-stricken. But it was too late. I'd\nalready  slipped  him  Hassan's  trick.  I\npulled hard and our kite plummeted. I\ncould  almost  feel  our  string  sawing\nhis. Almost heard the snap.<br><br>   Then,  just  like  that,  the  green  kite\nwas  spinning  and  wheeling  out  of\ncontrol.<br><br>   Behind  us,  people  cheered.\nWhistles  and  applause  broke  out.  I\nwas panting. The last time I had felt a\nrush  like  this  was  that  day  in  the\nwinter of 1975, just after I had cut the\nlast kite, when I spotted Baba on our\nrooftop, clapping, beaming.<br><br>   I  looked  down  at  Sohrab.  One", "corner  of  his  mouth  had  curled  up\njust so.<br><br> A smile.<br><br> Lopsided.<br><br> Hardly there.<br><br> But there.<br><br>     Behind  us,  kids  were  scampering,\nand  a  melee  of  screaming  kite\nrunners  was  chasing  the  loose  kite\ndrifting high above the trees. I blinked\nand  the  smile  was  gone.  But  it  had\nbeen there. I had seen it.<br><br> \"Do you want me to run that kite for\nyou?\"<br><br>   His  Adam's  apple  rose  and  fell  as\nhe  swallowed.  The  wind  lifted  his\nhair. I thought I saw him nod.<br><br>   \"For  you,  a  thousand  times  over,\"  I\nheard myself say. ", "  Then I turned and ran.<br><br> It was only a smile, nothing more. It\ndidn't  make  everything  all  right.  It\ndidn't  make  anything  all  right.  Only  a\nsmile.  A  tiny  thing.  A  leaf  in  the\nwoods,  shaking  in  the  wake  of  a\nstartled bird's flight.<br><br>   But  I'll  take  it.  With  open  arms.\nBecause when spring comes, it melts\nthe  snow  one  flake  at  a  time,  and\nmaybe  I  just  witnessed  the  first  flake\nmelting.<br><br>   I  ran.  A  grown  man  running  with  a\nswarm  of  screaming  children.  But  I\ndidn't  care.  I  ran  with  the  wind\nblowing  in  my  face,  and  a  smile  as\nwide as the Valley of Panjsher on my\nlips.<br><br> I ran.<br><br>\nThe End ", "<br><br>\n<br><br>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS: \nI  am  indebted  to  the  following\ncolleagues  for  their  advice,\nassistance,  or  support:  Dr.  Alfred\nLerner,  Don  Vakis,  Robin  Heck,  Dr.\nTodd  Dray,  Dr.  Robert  Tull,  and  Dr.\nSandy  Chun.
