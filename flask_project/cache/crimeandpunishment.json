["#$#$Chapter 1#$#$\nOn an exceptionally hot evening early in July a\nyoung \nman came out of the garret in which he lodged\nin  S.  Place  and  walked  slowly,  as  though  in\nhesitation, towards K. bridge.\nHe  had  successfully  avoided  meeting  his\nlandlady on the staircase. His garret was under\nthe  roof  of  a  high,  five-storied  house  and  was\nmore like a cupboard than a room. The landlady\nwho  provided  him  with  garret,  dinners,  and\nattendance, lived on the floor below, and every\ntime  he  went  out  he  was  obliged  to  pass  her\nkitchen,  the  door  of  which  invariably  stood\nopen. And each time he passed, the young man\nhad a sick, frightened feeling, which made him\nscowl and feel ashamed. He was hopelessly in\ndebt to his landlady, and was afraid of meeting\nher.\nThis  was  not  because  he  was  cowardly  and\nabject,  quite  the  contrary;  but  for  some  time", "past  he  had  been  in  an  overstrained  irritable\ncondition,  verging  on  hypochondria.  He  had\nbecome so completely absorbed in himself, and\nisolated  from  his  fellows  that  he  dreaded\nmeeting,  not  only  his  landlady,  but  anyone  at\nall.  He  was  crushed  by  poverty,  but  the\nanxieties  of  his  position  had  of  late  ceased  to\nweigh  upon  him.  He  had  given  up  attending  to\nmatters  of  practical  importance;  he  had  lost  all\ndesire to do so. Nothing that any landlady could\ndo had a real terror for him. But to be stopped\non the stairs, to be forced to listen to her trivial,\nirrelevant  gossip,  to  pestering  demands  for\npayment,  threats  and  complaints,  and  to  rack\nhis brains for excuses, to prevaricate, to lie-no,\nrather than that, he would creep down the stairs\nlike a cat and slip out unseen.\nThis  evening,  however,  on  coming  out  into  the\nstreet, he became acutely aware of his fears.\n'I  want  to  attempt  a  thing  like  that  and  am\nfrightened  by  these  trifles,'  he  thought,  with  an\nodd  smile.  'Hm  ...  yes,  all  is  in  a  man's  hands\nand  he  lets  it  all  slip  from  cowardice,  that's  an\naxiom. It would be interesting to know what it is\nmen  are  most  afraid  of.  Taking  a  new  step,", "uttering  a  new  word  is  what  they  fear  most....\nBut I am talking too much. It's because I chatter\nthat I do nothing. Or perhaps it is that I chatter\nbecause I do nothing. I've learned to chatter this\nlast  month,  lying  for  days  together  in  my  den\nthinking  ...  of  Jack  the  Giant-killer.  Why  am  I\ngoing there now? Am I capable of that? Is that\nserious?  It  is  not  serious  at  all.  It's  simply  a\nfantasy  to  amuse  myself;  a  plaything!  Yes,\nmaybe it is a plaything.'\nThe  heat  in  the  street  was  terrible:  and  the\nairlessness,  the  bustle  and  the  plaster,\nscaffolding, bricks, and dust all about him, and\nthat special Petersburg stench, so familiar to all\nwho are unable to get out of town in summer-all\nworked  painfully    upon    the    young    man's \nalready    overwrought  nerves.  The  insufferable\nstench  from  the  pot-  houses,  which  are\nparticularly  numerous  in  that  part  of  the  town,\nand the drunken men whom he met continually,\nalthough  it  was  a  working  day,  completed  the\nrevolting misery of the picture. An expression of\nthe profoundest disgust gleamed for a moment\nin the young man's refined face. He was, by the\nway,  exceptionally  handsome,  above  the\naverage in height, slim, well-built, with beautiful", "dark  eyes  and  dark  brown  hair.  Soon  he  sank\ninto deep thought, or more accurately speaking\ninto  a  complete  blankness  of  mind;  he  walked\nalong  not  observing  what  was  about  him  and\nnot  caring  to  observe  it.  From  time  to  time,  he\nwould  mutter  something,  from  the  habit  of\ntalking  to  himself,  to  which  he  had  just\nconfessed. At these moments he would become\nconscious  that  his  ideas  were  sometimes  in  a\ntangle and that he was very weak; for two days\nhe had scarcely tasted food.\nHe  was  so  badly  dressed  that  even  a  man\naccustomed  to  shabbiness  would  have  been\nashamed to be seen in the street in such rags.\nIn  that  quarter  of  the  town,  however,  scarcely\nany  shortcoming  in  dress  would  have  created\nsurprise.  Owing  to  the  proximity  of  the  Hay\nMarket,  the  number  of  establishments  of  bad\ncharacter, the preponderance of the trading and\nworking  class  population  crowded  in  these\nstreets  and  alleys  in  the  heart  of  Petersburg,\ntypes so various were to be seen in the streets\nthat  no  figure,  however  queer,  would  have\ncaused  surprise.  But  there  was  such\naccumulated  bitterness  and  contempt  in  the\nyoung  man's  heart,  that,  in  spite  of  all  the", "fastidiousness  of  youth,  he  minded  his  rags\nleast of all in the street. It was a different matter\nwhen he met with acquaintances or with former\nfellow  students,  whom,  indeed,  he  disliked\nmeeting  at  any  time.  And  yet  when  a  drunken\nman who, for some unknown reason, was being\ntaken  somewhere  in  a  huge  waggon  dragged\nby a heavy dray horse, suddenly shouted at him\nas  he  drove  past:  'Hey  there,  German  hatter'\nbawling  at  the  top  of  his  voice  and  pointing  at\nhim-the  young  man  stopped  suddenly  and\nclutched  tremulously  at  his  hat.  It  was  a  tall\nround  hat  from  Zimmerman's,  but  completely\nworn  out,  rusty  with  age,  all  torn  and\nbespattered, brimless and bent on one side in a\nmost  unseemly  fashion.  Not  shame,  however,\nbut  quite  another  feeling  akin  to  terror  had\novertaken him.\n'I  knew  it,'  he  muttered  in  confusion,  'I  thought\nso!  That's  the  worst  of  all!  Why,  a  stupid  thing\nlike  this,  the  most  trivial  detail  might  spoil  the\nwhole  plan.  Yes,  my  hat  is  too  noticeable....  It\nlooks  absurd  and  that  makes  it  noticeable....\nWith my rags I ought to wear a cap, any sort of\nold  pancake,  but  not  this  grotesque  thing.\nNobody wears such a hat, it would be noticed a", "mile  off,  it  would  be  remembered....  What\nmatters  is  that  people  would  remember  it,  and\nthat  would  give  them  a  clue.  For  this  business\none  should  be  as  little  conspicuous  as\npossible.... Trifles, trifles are what matter! Why,\nit's  just  such  trifles  that  always  ruin\neverything....'\nHe had not far to go; he knew indeed how many\nsteps it was from the gate of his lodging house:\nexactly  seven  hundred  and  thirty.  He  had\ncounted  them  once  when  he  had  been  lost  in\ndreams. At the time he had put no faith in those\ndreams and was only tantalising himself by their\nhideous but daring recklessness. Now, a month\nlater,  he  had  begun  to  look  upon  them\ndifferently,  and,  in  spite  of  the  monologues  in\nwhich  he  jeered  at  his  own  impotence  and\nindecision, he had involuntarily come to regard\nthis  'hideous'  dream  as  an  exploit  to  be\nattempted,  although  he  still  10  Crime  and\nPunishment did not realise this himself. He was\npositively  going  now  for  a  'rehearsal'  of  his\nproject,  and  at  every  step  his  excitement  grew\nmore and more violent.\nWith  a  sinking  heart  and  a  nervous  tremor,  he", "went  up  to  a  huge  house  which  on  one  side\nlooked on to the canal, and on the other into the\nstreet. This house was let out in tiny tenements\nand  was  inhabited  by  working  people  of  all\nkinds-tailors,  locksmiths,  cooks,  Germans  of\nsorts,  girls  picking  up  a  living  as  best  they\ncould,  petty  clerks,  etc.  There  was  a  continual\ncoming and going through the two gates and in\nthe  two  courtyards  of  the  house.  Three  or  four\ndoorkeepers  were  employed  on  the  building.\nThe young man was very glad to meet none of\nthem,  and  at  once  slipped  unnoticed  through\nthe  door  on  the  right,  and  up  the  staircase.  It\nwas a back staircase, dark and narrow, but he\nwas familiar with it already, and knew his way,\nand  he  liked  all  these  surroundings:  in  such\ndarkness  even  the  most  inquisitive  eyes  were\nnot to be dreaded.\n'If  I  am  so  scared  now,  what  would  it  be  if  it\nsomehow came to pass that I were really going\nto do it?' he could not help asking himself as he\nreached  the  fourth  storey.  There  his  progress\nwas barred by some porters who were engaged\nin  moving  furniture  out  of  a  flat.  He  knew  that\nthe flat had been occupied by a German clerk in\nthe  civil  service,  and  his  family.  This  German", "was moving out then, and so the fourth floor on\nthis  staircase  would  be  untenanted  except  by\nthe old woman. 'That's a good thing anyway,' he\nthought to himself, as he rang the bell of the old\nwoman's  flat.  The  bell  gave  a  faint  tinkle  as\nthough  it  were  made  of  tin  and  not  of  Free\neBooks  at  Planet  eBook.com  11  copper.  The\nlittle flats in such houses always have bells that\nring like that. He had forgotten the note of that\nbell,  and  now  its  peculiar  tinkle  seemed  to\nremind him of something and to bring it clearly\nbefore  him....  He  started,  his  nerves  were\nterribly overstrained by now. In a little while, the\ndoor  was  opened  a  tiny  crack:  the  old  woman\neyed her visitor with evident distrust through the\ncrack,  and  nothing  could  be  seen  but  her  little\neyes,  glittering  in  the  darkness.  But,  seeing  a\nnumber  of  people  on  the  landing,  she  grew\nbolder,  and  opened  the  door  wide.  The  young\nman  stepped  into  the  dark  entry,  which  was\npartitioned  off  from  the  tiny  kitchen.  The  old\nwoman stood facing him in silence and looking\ninquiringly  at  him.  She  was  a  diminutive,\nwithered  up  old  woman  of  sixty,  with  sharp\nmalignant  eyes  and  a  sharp  little  nose.  Her\ncolourless,  somewhat  grizzled  hair  was  thickly\nsmeared with oil, and she wore no kerchief over", "it. Round her thin long neck, which looked like a\nhen's leg, was knotted some sort of flannel rag,\nand, in spite of the heat, there hung flapping on\nher  shoulders,  a  mangy  fur  cape,  yellow  with\nage.  The  old  woman  coughed  and  groaned  at\nevery instant. The young man must have looked\nat  her  with  a  rather  peculiar  expression,  for  a\ngleam of mistrust came into her eyes again.\n'Raskolnikov,  a  student,  I  came  here  a  month\nago,' the young man made haste to mutter, with\na  half  bow,  remembering  that  he  ought  to  be\nmore polite.\n'I remember, my good sir, I remember quite well\nyour  coming  here,'  the  old  woman  said\ndistinctly, still keeping her inquiring eyes on his\nface.1(cid:24) Crime and Punishment 'And here ... I am\nagain  on  the  same  errand,'  Raskolnikov\ncontinued, a little disconcerted and surprised at\nthe  old  woman's  mistrust.  'Perhaps  she  is\nalways  like  that  though,  only  I  did  not  notice  it\nthe  other  time,'  he  thought  with  an  uneasy\nfeeling.The  old  woman  paused,  as  though \nhesitating;    then  stepped  on  one  side,  and\npointing  to  the  door  of  the  room,  she  said,\nletting her visitor pass in front of her:", "'Step in, my good sir.'\nThe  little  room  into  which  the  young  man\nwalked,  with  yellow  paper  on  the  walls,\ngeraniums and muslin curtains in the windows,\nwas  brightly  lighted  up  at  that  moment  by  the\nsetting sun.\n'So the sun will shine like this then too!' flashed\nas  it  were  by  chance  through  Raskolnikov's\nmind,  and  with  a  rapid  glance  he  scanned\neverything in the room, trying as far as possible\nto  notice  and  remember  its  arrangement.  But\nthere  was  nothing  special  in  the  room.  The\nfurniture,  all  very  old  and  of  yellow  wood,\nconsisted  of  a  sofa  with  a  huge  bent  wooden\nback,  an  oval  table  in  front  of  the  sofa,  a\ndressingtable  with  a  looking-glass  fixed  on  it\nbetween  the  windows,  chairs  along  the  walls\nand  two  or  three  half-penny  prints  in  yellow\nframes,  representing  German  damsels  with\nbirds in their hands-that was all. In the corner a\nlight  was  burning  before  a  small  ikon.\nEverything  was  very  clean;  the  floor  and  the\nfurniture  were  brightly  polished;  everything\nshone.", "'Lizaveta's work,' thought the young man. There\nwas not a speck of dust to be seen in the whole\nflat.\n'It's in the houses of spiteful old widows that one\nfinds Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 1(cid:24) such\ncleanliness,' Raskolnikov thought again, and he\nstole a curious glance at the cotton curtain over\nthe door leading into another tiny room, in which\nstood  the  old  woman's  bed  and  chest  of\ndrawers  and  into  which  he  had  never  looked\nbefore.  These  two  rooms  made  up  the  whole\nflat.\n'What  do  you  want?'  the  old  woman  said\nseverely, coming into the room and, as before,\nstanding  in  front  of  him  so  as  to  look  him\nstraight in the face.\n'I've  brought  something  to  pawn  here,'  and  he\ndrew  out  of  his  pocket  an  old-fashioned  flat\nsilver  watch,  on  the  back  of  which  was\nengraved a globe; the chain was of steel.\n'But  the  time  is  up  for  your  last  pledge.  The\nmonth was up the day before yesterday.'", "'I  will  bring  you  the  interest  for  another  month;\nwait a little.'\n'But that's for me to do as I please, my good sir,\nto wait or to sell your pledge at once.'\n'How  much  will  you  give  me  for  the  watch,\nAlyona Ivanovna?'\n'You  come  with  such  trifles,  my  good  sir,  it's\nscarcely worth anything. I gave you two roubles\nlast time for your ring and one could buy it quite\nnew at a jeweler's for a rouble and a half.'\n'Give me four roubles for it, I shall redeem it, it\nwas my father's. I shall be getting some money\nsoon.'\n'A rouble and a half, and interest in advance, if\nyou like!'\n'A rouble and a half!' cried the young man.\n'Please  yourself'-and  the  old  woman  handed\nhim back the watch. The young man took it, and\nwas so angry that he 1(cid:24) Crime and Punishment", "was  on  the  point  of  going  away;  but  checked\nhimself  at  once,  remembering  that  there  was\nnowhere else he could go, and that he had had\nanother object also in coming.\n'Hand it over,' he said roughly.\nThe  old  woman  fumbled  in  her  pocket  for  her\nkeys,  and  disappeared  behind  the  curtain  into\nthe  other  room.  The  young  man,  left  standing\nalone  in  the  middle  of  the  room,  listened\ninquisitively,  thinking.  He  could  hear  her\nunlocking the chest of drawers.\n'It must be the top drawer,' he reflected. 'So she\ncarries the keys in a pocket on the right. All in\none  bunch  on  a  steel  ring....  And  there's  one\nkey  there,  three  times  as  big  as  all  the  others,\nwith deep notches; that can't be the key of the\nchest  of  drawers  ...  then  there  must  be  some\nother  chest  or  strong-box  ...  that's  worth\nknowing.  Strong-boxes  always  have  keys  like\nthat ... but how degrading it all is.'\nThe old woman came back.\n'Here,  sir:  as  we  say  ten  copecks  the  rouble  a", "month,  so  I  must  take  fifteen  copecks  from  a\nrouble and a half for the month in advance. But\nfor  the  two  roubles  I  lent  you  before,  you  owe\nme now twenty copecks on the same reckoning\nin  advance.  That  makes  thirty-five  copecks\naltogether.  So  I  must  give  you  a  rouble  and\nfifteen copecks for the watch. Here it is.'\n'What! only a rouble and fifteen copecks now!'\n'Just so.'\nThe young man did not dispute it and took the\nmoney. He looked at the old woman, and was in\nno hurry to get away, as though there was still\nsomething  he  wanted  to  say  Free  eBooks  at\nPlanet  eBook.com  1(cid:24)  or  to  do,  but  he  did  not\nhimself quite know what.\n'I may be bringing you something else in a day\nor  two,  Alyona  Ivanovna  -a  valuable\nthing-silver-a  cigarettebox,  as  soon  as  I  get  it\nback from a friend ...' he broke off in confusion.\n'Well, we will talk about it then, sir.'\n'Good-bye-are you always at home alone, your", "sister  is  not  here  with  you?'  He  asked  her  as\ncasually  as  possible  as  he  went  out  into  the\npassage.\n'What business is she of yours, my good sir?'\n'Oh, nothing particular, I simply asked. You are\ntoo quick.... Good-day, Alyona Ivanovna.'\nRaskolnikov  went  out  in  complete  confusion.\nThis confusion became more and more intense.\nAs  he  went  down  the  stairs,  he  even  stopped\nshort,  two  or  three  times,  as  though  suddenly\nstruck  by  some  thought.  When  he  was  in  the\nstreet he cried out, 'Oh, God, how loathsome it\nall  is!  and  can  I,  can  I  possibly....  No,  it's\nnonsense,  it's  rubbish!'  he  added  resolutely.\n'And  how  could  such  an  atrocious  thing  come\ninto  my  head?  What  filthy  things  my  heart  is\ncapable  of.  Yes,  filthy  above  all,  disgusting,\nloathsome,  loathsome!-and  for  a  whole  month\nI've  been....'  But  no  words,  no  exclamations,\ncould  express  his  agitation.  The  feeling  of\nintense repulsion, which had begun to oppress\nand torture his heart while he was on his way to\nthe  old  woman,  had  by  now  reached  such  a\npitch and had taken such a definite form that he", "did not know what to do with himself to escape\nfrom  his  wretchedness.  He  walked  along  the\npavement like a drunken man, regardless of the\npassers-by,  and  jostling  against  them,  and  1(cid:24)\nCrime and Punishment only came to his senses\nwhen he was in the next street. Looking round,\nhe  noticed  that  he  was  standing  close  to  a\ntavern which was entered by steps leading from\nthe  pavement  to  the  basement.  At  that  instant\ntwo  drunken  men  came  out  at  the  door,  and\nabusing  and  supporting  one  another,  they\nmounted  the  steps.  Without  stopping  to  think,\nRaskolnikov  went  down  the  steps  at  once.  Till\nthat  moment  he  had  never  been  into  a  tavern,\nbut  now  he  felt  giddy  and  was  tormented  by  a\nburning  thirst.  He  longed  for  a  drink  of  cold\nbeer, and attributed his sudden weakness to the\nwant of food. He sat down at a sticky little table\nin  a  dark  and  dirty  corner;  ordered  some  beer,\nand eagerly drank off the first glassful. At once\nhe felt easier; and his thoughts became clear.\n'All  that's  nonsense,'  he  said  hopefully,  'and\nthere  is  nothing  in  it  all  to  worry  about!  It's\nsimply  physical  derangement.  Just  a  glass  of\nbeer,  a  piece  of  dry  bread-and  in  one  moment\nthe brain is stronger, the mind is clearer and the", "will is firm! Phew, how utterly petty it all is!'\nBut in spite of this scornful reflection, he was by\nnow  looking  cheerful  as  though  he  were\nsuddenly set free from a terrible burden: and he\ngazed  round  in  a  friendly  way  at  the  people  in\nthe  room.  But  even  at  that  moment  he  had  a\ndim  foreboding  that  this  happier  frame  of  mind\nwas also not normal.\nThere were few people at the time in the tavern.\nBesides  the  two  drunken  men  he  had  met  on\nthe steps, a group consisting of about five men\nand a girl with a concertina had gone out at the\nsame  time.  Their  departure  left  the  room  quiet\nand rather empty. The persons still in the tavern\nwere  Free  eBooks  at  Planet  eBook.com  1(cid:24)  a\nman who appeared to be an artisan, drunk, but\nnot  extremely  so,  sitting  before  a  pot  of  beer,\nand  his  companion,  a  huge,  stout  man  with  a\ngrey  beard,  in  a  short  full-skirted  coat.  He  was\nvery  drunk:  and  had  dropped  asleep  on  the\nbench;  every  now  and  then,  he  began  as\nthough  in  his  sleep,  cracking  his  fingers,  with\nhis  arms  wide  apart  and  the  upper  part  of  his\nbody  bounding  about  on  the  bench,  while  he\nhummed  some  meaningless  refrain,  trying  to", "recall some such lines as these:\n'His  wife  a  year  he  fondly  loved  His  wife  a-a\nyear he-fondly loved.'\nOr suddenly waking up again:\n'Walking along the crowded row He met the one\nhe used to know.'\nBut  no  one  shared  his  enjoyment:  his  silent\ncompanion  looked  with  positive  hostility  and\nmistrust  at  all  these  manifestations.  There  was\nanother man in the room who looked somewhat\nlike  a  retired  government  clerk.  He  was  sitting\napart,  now  and  then  sipping  from  his  pot  and\nlooking  round  at  the  company.  He,  too,\nappeared to be in some agitation.1(cid:24) Crime and\nPunishment ", "#$#$Chapter 2#$#$\nRaskolnikov  was  not  used  to  crowds,  and,  as\nwe  said  before,  he  avoided  society  of  every\nsort, more especially of late. But now all at once\nhe  felt  a  desire  to  be  with  other  people.\nSomething  new  seemed  to  be  taking  place\nwithin him, and with it he felt a sort of thirst for\ncompany. He was so weary after a whole month\nof  concentrated  wretchedness  and  gloomy\nexcitement  that  he  longed  to  rest,  if  only  for  a\nmoment, in some other world, whatever it might\nbe;  and,  in  spite  of  the  filthiness  of  the\nsurroundings,  he  was  glad  now  to  stay  in  the\ntavern.\nThe master of the establishment was in another\nroom, but he frequently came down some steps\ninto the main room, his jaunty, tarred boots with\nred  turn-over  tops  coming  into  view  each  time\nbefore the rest of his person. He wore a full coat\nand a horribly greasy black satin waistcoat, with\nno cravat, and his whole face seemed smeared\nwith oil like an iron lock. At the counter stood a\nboy  of  about  fourteen,  and  there  was  another", "boy  somewhat  younger  who  handed  whatever\nwas  wanted.  On  the  counter  lay  some  sliced\ncucumber,  some  pieces  of  dried  black  bread,\nand  some  fish,  chopped  up  small,  all  smelling\nvery  bad.  It  was  insufferably  close,  and  so\nheavy with the fumes of spirits that five minutes\nin such an atmosphere might well make a man\ndrunk.\nThere are chance meetings with strangers that\ninterest Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 1(cid:24) us\nfrom the first moment, before a word is spoken.\nSuch was the impression made on Raskolnikov\nby  the  person  sitting  a  little  distance  from  him,\nwho looked like a retired clerk. The young man\noften  recalled  this  impression  afterwards,  and\neven  ascribed  it  to  presentiment.  He  looked\nrepeatedly at the clerk, partly no doubt because\nthe  latter  was  staring  persistently  at  him,\nobviously anxious to enter into conversation. At\nthe  other  persons  in  the  room,  including  the\ntavern-  keeper,  the  clerk  looked  as  though  he\nwere  used  to  their  company,  and  weary  of  it,\nshowing  a  shade  of  condescending  contempt\nfor  them  as  persons  of  station  and  culture\ninferior  to  his  own,  with  whom  it  would  be\nuseless  for  him  to  converse.  He  was  a  man", "over  fifty,  bald  and  grizzled,  of  medium  height,\nand  stoutly  built.  His  face,  bloated  from\ncontinual  drinking,  was  of  a  yellow,  even\ngreenish,  tinge,  with  swollen  eyelids  out  of\nwhich  keen  reddish  eyes  gleamed  like  little\nchinks. But there was something very strange in\nhim; there was a light in his eyes as though of\nintense  feeling-perhaps  there  were  even\nthought  and  intelligence,  but  at  the  same  time\nthere was a gleam of something like madness.\nHe  was  wearing  an  old  and  hopelessly  ragged\nblack  dress  coat,  with  all  its  buttons  missing\nexcept  one,  and  that  one  he  had  buttoned,\nevidently  clinging  to  this  last  trace  of\nrespectability.  A  crumpled  shirt  front,  covered\nwith  spots  and  stains,  protruded  from  his\ncanvas  waistcoat.  Like  a  clerk,  he  wore  no\nbeard,  nor  moustache,  but  had  been  so  long\nunshaven that his chin looked like a stiff greyish\nbrush.  And  there  was  something  respectable\nand like an official about his manner too. But he\nwas  restless;  he  ruffled  (cid:24)0  Crime  and\nPunishment up his hair and from time to time let\nhis head drop into his hands dejectedly resting\nhis  ragged  elbows  on  the  stained  and  sticky\ntable. At last he looked straight at Raskolnikov,\nand said loudly and resolutely:", "'May  I  venture,  honoured  sir,  to  engage  you  in\npolite  conversation?  Forasmuch  as,  though\nyour  exterior  would  not  command  respect,  my\nexperience admonishes me that you are a man\nof  education  and  not  accustomed  to  drinking.  I\nhave  always  respected  education  when  in\nconjunction  with  genuine  sentiments,  and  I  am\nbesides  a  titular  counsellor  in  rank.\nMarmeladov-such  is  my  name;  titular\ncounsellor.  I  make  bold  to  inquire-have  you\nbeen in the service?'\n'No,  I  am  studying,'  answered  the  young  man,\nsomewhat  surprised  at  the  grandiloquent  style\nof  the  speaker  and  also  at  being  so  directly\naddressed. In spite of the momentary desire he\nhad  just  been  feeling  for  company  of  any  sort,\non being actually spoken to he felt immediately\nhis  habitual  irritable  and  uneasy  aversion  for\nany  stranger  who  approached  or  attempted  to\napproach him.\n'A student then, or formerly a student,' cried the\nclerk.  'Just  what  I  thought!  I'm  a  man  of\nexperience,  immense  experience,  sir,'  and  he\ntapped  his  forehead  with  his  fingers  in", "self-approval.  'You've  been  a  student  or  have\nattended  some  learned  institution!  ...  But  allow\nme....' He got up, staggered, took up his jug and\nglass,  and  sat  down  beside  the  young  man,\nfacing him a little sideways. He was drunk, but\nspoke  fluently  and  boldly,  only  occasionally\nlosing the thread of his sentences and drawling\nhis  words.  He  pounced  upon  Raskolnikov  as\ngreedily as though he too had not spo-1 ken to\na soul for a month.\n'Honoured sir,' he began almost with solemnity,\n'poverty is not a vice, that's a true saying. Yet I\nknow too that drunkenness is not a virtue, and\nthat  that's  even  truer.  But  beggary,  honoured\nsir,  beggary  is  a  vice.  In  poverty  you  may  still\nretain  your  innate  nobility  of  soul,  but  in\nbeggary-never-no  one.  For  beggary  a  man  is\nnot chased out of human society with a stick, he\nis swept out with a broom, so as to make it as\nhumiliating  as  possible;  and  quite  right,  too,\nforasmuch  as  in  beggary  I  am  ready  to  be  the\nfirst  to  humiliate  myself.  Hence  the  pot-house!\nHonoured  sir,  a  month  ago  Mr.  Lebeziatnikov\ngave my wife a beating, and my wife is a very\ndifferent  matter  from  me!  Do  you  understand?\nAllow  me  to  ask  you  another  question  out  of", "simple curiosity: have you ever spent a night on\na hay barge, on the Neva?'\n'No,  I  have  not  happened  to,'  answered\nRaskolnikov. 'What do you mean?'\n'Well,  I've  just  come  from  one  and  it's  the  fifth\nnight I've slept so....' He filled his glass, emptied\nit and paused. Bits of hay were in fact clinging\nto his clothes and sticking to his hair. It seemed\nquite  probable  that  he  had  not  undressed  or\nwashed  for  the  last  five  days.  His  hands,\nparticularly,  were  filthy.  They  were  fat  and  red,\nwith black nails.\nHis  conversation  seemed  to  excite  a  general\nthough languid interest. The boys at the counter\nfell  to  sniggering.  The  innkeeper  came  down\nfrom the upper room, apparently on purpose to\nlisten to the 'funny fellow' and sat down at a little\ndistance,  yawning  lazily,  but  with  dignity.\nEvidently  Marmeladov  was  a  familiar  figure\nhere,  and  he  had  most  likely  acquired  his\nweakness  for  high-flown  speeches  from  the\nhabit  of  frequently  entering  into  conversation\nwith  strangers  of  all  sorts  in  the  tavern.  This\nhabit  develops  into  a  necessity  in  some", "drunkards,  and  especially  in  those  who  are\nlooked after sharply and kept in order at home.\nHence in the company of other drinkers they try\nto justify themselves and even if possible obtain\nconsideration.\n'Funny  fellow!'  pronounced  the  innkeeper.  'And\nwhy don't you work, why aren't you at your duty,\nif you are in the service?'\n'Why  am  I  not  at  my  duty,  honoured  sir,'\nMarmeladov  went  on,  addressing  himself\nexclusively  to  Raskolnikov,  as  though  it  had\nbeen he who put that question to him. 'Why am\nI  not  at  my  duty?  Does  not  my  heart  ache  to\nthink what a useless worm I am? A month ago\nwhen  Mr.  Lebeziatnikov  beat  my  wife  with  his\nown  hands,  and  I  lay  drunk,  didn't  I  suffer?\nExcuse  me,  young  man,  has  it  ever  happened\nto you ... hm ... well, to petition hopelessly for a\nloan?'\n'Yes,  it  has.  But  what  do  you  mean  by\nhopelessly?'\n'Hopelessly in the fullest sense, when you know\nbeforehand  that  you  will  get  nothing  by  it.  You", "know,  for  instance,  beforehand  with  positive\ncertainty that this man, this most reputable and\nexemplary citizen, will on no consideration give\nyou  money;  and  indeed  I  ask  you  why  should\nhe? For he knows of course that I shan't pay it\nback. From compassion? But Mr. Lebeziatnikov\nwho keeps up with modern ideas explained the\nother  day  that  compassion  is  forbidden\nnowadays by science itself, and that that's what\nis done now in England, where there is political\neconomy. Why, I ask (cid:24) you, should he give it to\nme? And yet though I know beforehand that he\nwon't, I set off to him and ...'\n'Why do you go?' put in Raskolnikov.\n'Well, when one has no one, nowhere else one\ncan  go!  For  every  man  must  have  somewhere\nto  go.  Since  there  are  times  when  one\nabsolutely must go somewhere! When my own\ndaughter first went out with a yellow ticket, then\nI  had  to  go  ...  (for  my  daughter  has  a  yellow\npassport),'  he  added  in  parenthesis,  looking\nwith a certain uneasiness at the young man. 'No\nmatter, sir, no matter!' he went on hurriedly and\nwith apparent composure when both the boys at\nthe  counter  guffawed  and  even  the  innkeeper", "smiled-'No matter, I am not confounded by the\nwagging  of  their  heads;  for  everyone  knows\neverything about it already, and all that is secret\nis  made  open.  And  I  accept  it  all,  not  with\ncontempt,  but  with  humility.  So  be  it!  So  be  it!\n'Behold the man!' Excuse me, young man, can\nyou....  No,  to  put  it  more  strongly  and  more\ndistinctly;  not  can  you  but  dare  you,  looking\nupon me, assert that I am not a pig?'\nThe young man did not answer a word.\n'Well,'  the  orator  began  again  stolidly  and  with\neven  increased  dignity,  after  waiting  for  the\nlaughter in the room to subside. 'Well, so be it, I\nam  a  pig,  but  she  is  a  lady!  I  have  the\nsemblance  of  a  beast,  but  Katerina  Ivanovna,\nmy  spouse,  is  a  person  of  education  and  an\nofficer's  daughter.  Granted,  granted,  I  am  a\nscoundrel, but she is a woman of a noble heart,\nfull of sentiments, refined by education. And yet\n...  oh,  if  only  she  felt  for  me!  Honoured  sir,\nhonoured  sir,  you  know  every  man  ought  to\nhave  at  least  one  place  where  people  feel  for\nhim!  But  Katerina  Ivanovna,  though  she  is\nmagnanimous,  she  is  unjust....  And  yet,\nalthough  I  realise  that  when  she  pulls  my  hair", "she  only  does  it  out  of  pity-for  I  repeat  without\nbeing ashamed, she pulls my hair, young man,'\nhe declared with redoubled dignity, hearing the\nsniggering again-'but, my God, if she would but\nonce.... But no, no! It's all in vain and it's no use\ntalking! No use talking! For more than once, my\nwish did come true and more than once she has\nfelt  for  me  but  ...  such  is  my  fate  and  I  am  a\nbeast by nature!'\n'Rather!'  assented  the  innkeeper  yawning.\nMarmeladov  struck  his  fist  resolutely  on  the\ntable.\n'Such  is  my  fate!  Do  you  know,  sir,  do  you\nknow, I have sold her very stockings for drink?\nNot her shoes-that would be more or less in the\norder of things, but her stockings, her stockings\nI have sold for drink! Her mohair shawl I sold for\ndrink,  a  present  to  her  long  ago,  her  own\nproperty,  not  mine;  and  we  live  in  a  cold  room\nand she caught cold this winter and has begun\ncoughing and spitting blood too. We have three\nlittle  children  and  Katerina  Ivanovna  is  at  work\nfrom  morning  till  night;  she  is  scrubbing  and\ncleaning  and  washing  the  children,  for  she's\nbeen  used  to  cleanliness  from  a  child.  But  her", "chest  is  weak  and  she  has  a  tendency  to\nconsumption  and  I  feel  it!  Do  you  suppose  I\ndon't feel it? And the more I drink the more I feel\nit. That's why I drink too. I try to find sympathy\nand feeling in drink.... I drink so that I may suffer\ntwice  as  much!'  And  as  though  in  despair  he\nlaid his head down on the table.\n'Young  man,'  he  went  on,  raising  his  head\nagain,  'in  your  (cid:24)  face  I  seem  to  read  some\ntrouble of mind. When you came in I read it, and\nthat  was  why  I  addressed  you  at  once.  For  in\nunfolding  to  you  the  story  of  my  life,  I  do  not\nwish  to  make  myself  a  laughing-stock  before\nthese idle listeners, who indeed know all about\nit already, but I am looking for a man of feeling\nand  education.  Know  then  that  my  wife  was\neducated  in  a  high-class  school  for  the\ndaughters  of  noblemen,  and  on  leaving  she\ndanced  the  shawl  dance  before  the  governor\nand  other  personages  for  which  she  was\npresented with a gold medal and a certificate of\nmerit.  The  medal  ...  well,  the  medal  of  course\nwas  sold-long  ago,  hm  ...  but  the  certificate  of\nmerit  is  in  her  trunk  still  and  not  long  ago  she\nshowed it to our landlady. And although she is\nmost continually on bad terms with the landlady,", "yet she wanted to tell someone or other of her\npast  honours  and  of  the  happy  days  that  are\ngone.  I  don't  condemn  her  for  it,  I  don't  blame\nher,  for  the  one  thing  left  her  is  recollection  of\nthe past, and all the rest is dust and ashes. Yes,\nyes,  she  is  a  lady  of  spirit,  proud  and\ndetermined.  She  scrubs  the  floors  herself  and\nhas  nothing  but  black  bread  to  eat,  but  won't\nallow  herself  to  be  treated  with  disrespect.\nThat's  why  she  would  not  overlook  Mr.\nLebeziatnikov's  rudeness  to  her,  and  so  when\nhe gave her a beating for it, she took to her bed\nmore from the hurt to her feelings than from the\nblows.  She  was  a  widow  when  I  married  her,\nwith three children, one smaller than the other.\nShe  married  her  first  husband,  an  infantry\nofficer, for love, and ran away with him from her\nfather's house. She was exceedingly fond of her\nhusband;  but  he  gave  way  to  cards,  got  into\ntrouble  and  with  that  he  died.  He  used  to  beat\nher at the end: and although she paid him back,\nof  which  I  have  authentic  documentary\nevidence,  to  this  day  she  speaks  of  him  with\ntears  and  she  throws  him  up  to  me;  and  I  am\nglad, I am glad that, though only in imagination,\nshe should think of herself as having once been\nhappy....  And  she  was  left  at  his  death  with", "three  children  in  a  wild  and  remote  district\nwhere  I  happened  to  be  at  the  time;  and  she\nwas left in such hopeless poverty that, although\nI  have  seen  many  ups  and  downs  of  all  sort,  I\ndon't  feel  equal  to  describing  it  even.  Her\nrelations  had  all  thrown  her  off.  And  she  was\nproud,  too,  excessively  proud....  And  then,\nhonoured  sir,  and  then,  I,  being  at  the  time  a\nwidower, with a daughter of fourteen left me by\nmy  first  wife,  offered  her  my  hand,  for  I  could\nnot  bear  the  sight  of  such  suffering.  You  can\njudge the extremity of her calamities, that she, a\nwoman  of  education  and  culture  and\ndistinguished  family,  should  have  consented  to\nbe my wife. But she did! Weeping and sobbing\nand  wringing  her  hands,  she  married  me!  For\nshe  had  nowhere  to  turn!  Do  you  understand,\nsir, do you understand what it means when you\nhave  absolutely  nowhere  to  turn?  No,  that  you\ndon't understand yet.... And for a whole year, I\nperformed  my  duties  conscientiously  and\nfaithfully, and did not touch this' (he tapped the\njug with his finger), 'for I have feelings. But even\nso,  I  could  not  please  her;  and  then  I  lost  my\nplace too, and that through no fault of mine but\nthrough  changes  in  the  office;  and  then  I  did\ntouch it! ... It will be a year and a half ago soon", "since  we  found  ourselves  at  last  after  many\nwanderings  and  numerous  calamities  in  this\nmagnificent  capital,  adorned  with  innumerable\nmonuments.  Here  I  ob-(cid:24)  tained  a  situation....  I\nobtained  it  and  I  lost  it  again.  Do  you\nunderstand?  This  time  it  was  through  my  own\nfault I lost it: for my weakness had come out....\nWe  have  now  part  of  a  room  at  Amalia\nFyodorovna  Lippevechsel's;  and  what  we  live\nupon and what we pay our rent with, I could not\nsay.  There  are  a  lot  of  people  living  there\nbesides  ourselves.  Dirt  and  disorder,  a  perfect\nBedlam  ...  hm  ...  yes  ...  And  meanwhile  my\ndaughter  by  my  first  wife  has  grown  up;  and\nwhat my daughter has had to put up with from\nher  step-mother  whilst  she  was  growing  up,  I\nwon't  speak  of.  For,  though  Katerina  Ivanovna\nis  full  of  generous  feelings,  she  is  a  spirited\nlady, irritable and short-tempered.... Yes. But it's\nno use going over that! Sonia, as you may well\nfancy,  has  had  no  education.  I  did  make  an\neffort  four  years  ago  to  give  her  a  course  of\ngeography  and  universal  history,  but  as  I  was\nnot  very  well  up  in  those  subjects  myself  and\nwe had no suitable books, and what books we\nhad  ...  hm,  anyway  we  have  not  even  those\nnow, so all our instruction came to an end. We", "stopped  at  Cyrus  of  Persia.  Since  she  has\nattained  years  of  maturity,  she  has  read  other\nbooks of romantic tendency and of late she had\nread with great interest a book she got through\nMr.  Lebeziatnikov,  Lewes'  Physiology-do  you\nknow it?-and even recounted extracts from it to\nus:  and  that's  the  whole  of  her  education.  And\nnow  may  I  venture  to  address  you,  honoured\nsir, on my own account with a private question.\nDo you suppose that a respectable poor girl can\nearn much by honest work? Not fifteen farthings\na  day  can  she  earn,  if  she  is  respectable  and\nhas  no  special  talent  and  that  without  putting\nher work down for an instant! And what's more,\nIvan Ivanitch Klopstock the civil counsellor-have\nyou heard of him?-has not to this day paid her\nfor  the  half-dozen  linen  shirts  she  made  him\nand  drove  her  roughly  away,  stamping  and\nreviling her, on the pretext that the shirt collars\nwere not made like the pattern and were put in\naskew.  And  there  are  the  little  ones  hungry....\nAnd  Katerina  Ivanovna  walking  up  and  down\nand  wringing  her  hands,  her  cheeks  flushed\nred,  as  they  always  are  in  that  disease:  'Here\nyou  live  with  us,'  says  she,  'you  eat  and  drink\nand are kept warm and you do nothing to help.'\nAnd much she gets to eat and drink when there", "is not a crust for the little ones for three days! I\nwas  lying  at  the  time  ...  well,  what  of  it!  I  was\nlying drunk and I heard my Sonia speaking (she\nis a gentle creature with a soft little voice ... fair\nhair and such a pale, thin little face). She said:\n'Katerina Ivanovna, am I really to do a thing like\nthat?'  And  Darya  Frantsovna,  a  woman  of  evil\ncharacter  and  very  well  known  to  the  police,\nhad  two  or  three  times  tried  to  get  at  her\nthrough  the  landlady.  'And  why  not?'  said\nKaterina  Ivanovna  with  a  jeer,  'you  are\nsomething mighty precious to be so careful of!'\nBut don't blame her, don't blame her, honoured\nsir, don't blame her! She was not herself when\nshe  spoke,  but  driven  to  distraction  by  her\nillness  and  the  crying  of  the  hungry  children;\nand  it  was  said  more  to  wound  her  than\nanything  else....  For  that's  Katerina  Ivanovna's\ncharacter,  and  when  children  cry,  even  from\nhunger, she falls to beating them at once. At six\no'clock I saw Sonia get up, put on her kerchief\nand her cape, and go out of the room and about\nnine  o'clock  she  came  back.  She  walked\nstraight  up  to  Katerina  (cid:24)  Ivanovna  and  she  laid\nthirty roubles on the table before her in silence.\nShe did not utter a word, she did not even look\nat her, she simply picked up our big green drap", "de  dames  shawl  (we  have  a  shawl,  made  of\ndrap de dames), put it over her head and face\nand  lay  down  on  the  bed  with  her  face  to  the\nwall; only her little shoulders and her body kept\nshuddering.... And I went on lying there, just as\nbefore....  And  then  I  saw,  young  man,  I  saw\nKaterina Ivanovna, in the same silence go up to\nSonia's little bed; she was on her knees all the\nevening kissing Sonia's feet, and would not get\nup,  and  then  they  both  fell  asleep  in  each\nother's arms ... together, together ... yes ... and I\n... lay drunk.'\nMarmeladov stopped short, as though his voice\nhad  failed  him.  Then  he  hurriedly  filled  his\nglass, drank, and cleared his throat.\n'Since  then,  sir,'  he  went  on  after  a  brief\npause-'Since  then,  owing  to  an  unfortunate\noccurrence  and  through  information  given  by\nevil-  intentioned  persons-in  all  which  Darya\nFrantsovna  took  a  leading  part  on  the  pretext\nthat  she  had  been  treated  with  want  of\nrespect-since  then  my  daughter  Sofya\nSemyonovna  has  been  forced  to  take  a  yellow\nticket, and owing to that she is unable to go on\nliving  with  us.  For  our  landlady,  Amalia", "Fyodorovna  would  not  hear  of  it  (though  she\nhad  backed  up  Darya  Frantsovna  before)  and\nMr.  Lebeziatnikov  too  ...  hm....  All  the  trouble\nbetween  him  and  Katerina  Ivanovna  was  on\nSonia's account. At first he was for making up to\nSonia himself and then all of a sudden he stood\non  his  dignity:  'how,'  said  he,  'can  a  highly\neducated man like me live in the same rooms (cid:24)0\nCrime and Punishment with a girl like that?' And\nKaterina  Ivanovna  would  not  let  it  pass,  she\nstood  up  for  her  ...  and  so  that's  how  it\nhappened. And Sonia comes to us now, mostly\nafter dark; she comforts Katerina Ivanovna and\ngives her all she can.... She has a room at the\nKapernaumovs'  the  tailors,  she  lodges  with\nthem; Kapernaumov is a lame man with a cleft\npalate and all of his numerous family have cleft\npalates too. And his wife, too, has a cleft palate.\nThey  all  live  in  one  room,  but  Sonia  has  her\nown,  partitioned  off....  Hm  ...  yes  ...  very  poor\npeople  and  all  with  cleft  palates  ...  yes.  Then  I\ngot up in the morning, and put on my rags, lifted\nup  my  hands  to  heaven  and  set  off  to  his\nexcellency  Ivan  Afanasyvitch.  His  excellency\nIvan Afanasyvitch, do you know him? No? Well,\nthen,  it's  a  man  of  God  you  don't  know.  He  is\nwax ... wax before the face of the Lord; even as", "wax  melteth!  ...  His  eyes  were  dim  when  he\nheard my story. 'Marmeladov, once already you\nhave  deceived  my  expectations  ...  I'll  take  you\nonce more on my own responsibility'-that's what\nhe said, 'remember,' he said, 'and now you can\ngo.' I kissed the dust at his feet-in thought only,\nfor  in  reality  he  would  not  have  allowed  me  to\ndo it, being a statesman and a man of modern\npolitical and enlightened ideas. I returned home,\nand when I announced that I'd been taken back\ninto  the  service  and  should  receive  a  salary,\nheavens, what a to-do there was ...!'\nMarmeladov  stopped  again  in  violent\nexcitement.  At  that  moment  a  whole  party  of\nrevellers already drunk came in from the street,\nand  the  sounds  of  a  hired  concertina  and  the\ncracked piping voice of a child of seven singing\n'The Hamlet' were heard in the entry. The room\nwas  filled  with  1  noise.  The  tavern-keeper  and\nthe  boys  were  busy  with  the  new-comers.\nMarmeladov  paying  no  attention  to  the  new\narrivals  continued  his  story.  He  appeared  by\nnow  to  be  extremely  weak,  but  as  he  became\nmore  and  more  drunk,  he  became  more  and\nmore  talkative.  The  recollection  of  his  recent\nsuccess  in  getting  the  situation  seemed  to", "revive him, and was positively reflected in a sort\nof  radiance  on  his  face.  Raskolnikov  listened\nattentively.\n'That  was  five  weeks  ago,  sir.  Yes....  As  soon\nas  Katerina  Ivanovna  and  Sonia  heard  of  it,\nmercy on us, it was as though I stepped into the\nkingdom  of  Heaven.  It  used  to  be:  you  can  lie\nlike a beast, nothing but abuse. Now they were\nwalking  on  tiptoe,  hushing  the  children.\n'Semyon  Zaharovitch  is  tired  with  his  work  at\nthe  office,  he  is  resting,  shh!'  They  made  me\ncoffee  before  I  went  to  work  and  boiled  cream\nfor me! They began to get real cream for me, do\nyou  hear  that?  And  how  they  managed  to  get\ntogether  the  money  for  a  decent  outfit-  eleven\nroubles,  fifty  copecks,  I  can't  guess.  Boots,\ncotton shirt- fronts-most magnificent, a uniform,\nthey  got  up  all  in  splendid  style,  for  eleven\nroubles  and  a  half.  The  first  morning  I  came\nback  from  the  office  I  found  Katerina  Ivanovna\nhad  cooked  two  courses  for  dinner-soup  and\nsalt meat with horse radish-which we had never\ndreamed of till then. She had not any dresses ...\nnone  at  all,  but  she  got  herself  up  as  though\nshe  were  going  on  a  visit;  and  not  that  she'd\nanything to do it with, she smartened herself up", "with  nothing  at  all,  she'd  done  her  hair  nicely,\nput  on  a  clean  collar  of  some  sort,  cuffs,  and\nthere she was, quite a different person, she was\nyounger  and  better  looking.  Sonia,  my  little\ndarling,  had  only  helped  with  money  'for  the\ntime,' she said, 'it won't do for me to come and\nsee  you  too  often.  After  dark  maybe  when  no\none can see.' Do you hear, do you hear? I lay\ndown  for  a  nap  after  dinner  and  what  do  you\nthink: though Katerina Ivanovna had quarrelled\nto  the  last  degree  with  our  landlady  Amalia\nFyodorovna  only  a  week  before,  she  could  not\nresist  then  asking  her  in  to  coffee.  For  two\nhours  they  were  sitting,  whispering  together.\n'Semyon  Zaharovitch  is  in  the  service  again,\nnow, and receiving a salary,' says she, 'and he\nwent  himself  to  his  excellency  and  his\nexcellency  himself  came  out  to  him,  made  all\nthe others wait and led Semyon Zaharovitch by\nthe  hand  before  everybody  into  his  study.'  Do\nyou  hear,  do  you  hear?  'To  be  sure,'  says  he,\n'Semyon  Zaharovitch,  remembering  your  past\nservices,'  says  he,  'and  in  spite  of  your\npropensity  to  that  foolish  weakness,  since  you\npromise now and since moreover we've got on\nbadly without you,' (do you hear, do you hear;)\n'and so,' says he, 'I rely now on your word as a", "gentleman.' And all that, let me tell you, she has\nsimply made up for herself, and not simply out\nof  wantonness,  for  the  sake  of  bragging;  no,\nshe  believes  it  all  herself,  she  amuses  herself\nwith her own fancies, upon my word she does!\nAnd  I  don't  blame  her  for  it,  no,  I  don't  blame\nher! ... Six days ago when I brought her my first\nearnings  in  full-twenty-three  roubles  forty\ncopecks  altogether-she  called  me  her  poppet:\n'poppet,'  said  she,  'my  little  poppet.'  And  when\nwe  were  by  ourselves,  you  understand?  You\nwould  not  think  me  a  beauty,  you  would  not\nthink much of me as a husband, would you? ...\nWell,  she  pinched  my  cheek,  'my  little  poppet,'\nsaid she.'(cid:24) Marmeladov broke off, tried to smile,\nbut  suddenly  his  chin  began  to  twitch.  He\ncontrolled  himself  however.  The  tavern,  the\ndegraded  appearance  of  the  man,  the  five\nnights  in  the  hay  barge,  and  the  pot  of  spirits,\nand  yet  this  poignant  love  for  his  wife  and\nchildren  bewildered  his  listener.  Raskolnikov\nlistened  intently  but  with  a  sick  sensation.  He\nfelt vexed that he had come here.\n'Honoured sir, honoured sir,' cried Marmeladov\nrecovering  himself-  'Oh,  sir,  perhaps  all  this\nseems  a  laughing  matter  to  you,  as  it  does  to", "others, and perhaps I am only worrying you with\nthe stupidity of all the trivial details of my home\nlife, but it is not a laughing matter to me. For I\ncan feel it all.... And the whole of that heavenly\nday  of  my  life  and  the  whole  of  that  evening  I\npassed  in  fleeting  dreams  of  how  I  would\narrange  it  all,  and  how  I  would  dress  all  the\nchildren,  and  how  I  should  give  her  rest,  and\nhow  I  should  rescue  my  own  daughter  from\ndishonour  and  restore  her  to  the  bosom  of  her\nfamily....  And  a  great  deal  more....  Quite\nexcusable,  sir.  Well,  then,  sir'  (Marmeladov\nsuddenly  gave  a  sort  of  start,  raised  his  head\nand  gazed  intently  at  his  listener)  'well,  on  the\nvery  next  day  after  all  those  dreams,  that  is  to\nsay, exactly five days ago, in the evening, by a\ncunning  trick,  like  a  thief  in  the  night,  I  stole\nfrom Katerina Ivanovna the key of her box, took\nout  what  was  left  of  my  earnings,  how  much  it\nwas I have forgotten, and now look at me, all of\nyou! It's the fifth day since I left home, and they\nare looking for me there and it's the end of my\nemployment, and my uniform is lying in a tavern\non  the  Egyptian  bridge.  I  exchanged  it  for  the\ngarments  I  have  on  ...  and  it's  the  end  of\neverything!'", "Marmeladov  struck  his  forehead  with  his  fist,\nclenched his teeth, closed his eyes and leaned\nheavily with his elbow on the table. But a minute\nlater  his  face  suddenly  changed  and  with  a\ncertain  assumed  slyness  and  affectation  of\nbravado,  he  glanced  at  Raskolnikov,  laughed\nand said:\n'This morning I went to see Sonia, I went to ask\nher for a pick-me-up! He-he-he!'\n'You don't say she gave it to you?' cried one of\nthe newcomers; he shouted the words and went\noff into a guffaw.\n'This  very  quart  was  bought  with  her  money,'\nMarmeladov  declared,  addressing  himself\nexclusively  to  Raskolnikov.  'Thirty  copecks  she\ngave  me  with  her  own  hands,  her  last,  all  she\nhad,  as  I  saw....  She  said  nothing,  she  only\nlooked at me without a word.... Not on earth, but\nup yonder ... they grieve over men, they weep,\nbut  they  don't  blame  them,  they  don't  blame\nthem! But it hurts more, it hurts more when they\ndon't  blame!  Thirty  copecks  yes!  And  maybe\nshe  needs  them  now,  eh?  What  do  you  think,\nmy dear sir? For now she's got to keep up her", "appearance.  It  costs  money,  that  smartness,\nthat  special  smartness,  you  know?  Do  you\nunderstand?  And  there's  pomatum,  too,  you\nsee, she must have things; petticoats, starched\nones,  shoes,  too,  real  jaunty  ones  to  show  off\nher foot when she has to step over a puddle. Do\nyou understand, sir, do you understand what all\nthat  smartness  means?  And  here  I,  her  own\nfather, here I took thirty copecks of that money\nfor  a  drink!  And  I  am  drinking  it!  And  I  have\nalready drunk it! Come, who will have pity on a\nman like me, eh? Are you sorry for me, sir, or (cid:24)\nnot?  Tell  me,  sir,  are  you  sorry  or  not?\nHe-he-he!'\nHe would have filled his glass, but there was no\ndrink left. The pot was empty.\n'What  are  you  to  be  pitied  for?'  shouted  the\ntavern-keeper who was again near them.\nShouts  of  laughter  and  even  oaths  followed.\nThe  laughter  and  the  oaths  came  from  those\nwho  were  listening  and  also  from  those  who\nhad  heard  nothing  but  were  simply  looking  at\nthe figure of the discharged government clerk.", "'To  be  pitied!  Why  am  I  to  be  pitied?'\nMarmeladov  suddenly  declaimed,  standing  up\nwith  his  arm  outstretched,  as  though  he  had\nbeen only waiting for that question.\n'Why  am  I  to  be  pitied,  you  say?  Yes!  there's\nnothing  to  pity  me  for!  I  ought  to  be  crucified,\ncrucified  on  a  cross,  not  pitied!  Crucify  me,  oh\njudge, crucify me but pity me! And then I will go\nof  myself  to  be  crucified,  for  it's  not\nmerrymaking I seek but tears and tribulation! ...\nDo  you  suppose,  you  that  sell,  that  this  pint  of\nyours has been sweet to me? It was tribulation I\nsought at the bottom of it, tears and tribulation,\nand have found it, and I have tasted it; but He\nwill  pity  us  Who  has  had  pity  on  all  men,  Who\nhas understood all men and all things, He is the\nOne,  He  too  is  the  judge.  He  will  come  in  that\nday and He will ask: 'Where is the daughter who\ngave  herself  for  her  cross,  consumptive\nstepmother and for the little children of another?\nWhere  is  the  daughter  who  had  pity  upon  the\nfilthy  drunkard,  her  earthly  father,  undismayed\nby  his  beastliness?'  And  He  will  say,  'Come  to\nme! I have already forgiven thee once.... I have\nforgiven thee once.... Thy sins which are many\nare  forgiv  en  thee  for  thou  hast  loved  much....'", "And  he  will  forgive  my  Sonia,  He  will  forgive,  I\nknow  it  ...  I  felt  it  in  my  heart  when  I  was  with\nher just now! And He will judge and will forgive\nall,  the  good  and  the  evil,  the  wise  and  the\nmeek....  And  when  He  has  done  with  all  of\nthem,  then  He  will  summon  us.  'You  too  come\nforth,'  He  will  say,  'Come  forth  ye  drunkards,\ncome  forth,  ye  weak  ones,  come  forth,  ye\nchildren of shame!' And we shall all come forth,\nwithout shame and shall stand before him. And\nHe will say unto us, 'Ye are swine, made in the\nImage of the Beast and with his mark; but come\nye  also!'  And  the  wise  ones  and  those  of\nunderstanding will say, 'Oh Lord, why dost Thou\nreceive  these  men?'  And  He  will  say,  'This  is\nwhy  I  receive  them,  oh  ye  wise,  this  is  why  I\nreceive  them,  oh  ye  of  understanding,  that  not\none  of  them  believed  himself  to  be  worthy  of\nthis.' And He will hold out His hands to us and\nwe  shall  fall  down  before  him  ...  and  we  shall\nweep  ...  and  we  shall  understand  all  things!\nThen  we  shall  understand  all!  ...  and  all  will\nunderstand, Katerina Ivanovna even ... she will\nunderstand.... Lord, Thy kingdom come!' And he\nsank  down  on  the  bench  exhausted,  and\nhelpless, looking at no one, apparently oblivious\nof  his  surroundings  and  plunged  in  deep", "thought.  His  words  had  created  a  certain\nimpression; there was a moment of silence; but\nsoon laughter and oaths were heard again.\n'That's his notion!'\n'Talked himself silly!'\n'A fine clerk he is!'\nAnd  so  on,  and  so  on.(cid:24)  'Let  us  go,  sir,'  said\nMarmeladov  all  at  once,  raising  his  head  and\naddressing Raskolnikov-'come along with me ...\nKozel's  house,  looking  into  the  yard.  I'm  going\nto Katerina Ivanovna-time I did.'\nRaskolnikov had for some time been wanting to\ngo and he had meant to help him. Marmeladov\nwas  much  unsteadier  on  his  legs  than  in  his\nspeech  and  leaned  heavily  on  the  young  man.\nThey  had  two  or  three  hundred  paces  to  go.\nThe  drunken  man  was  more  and  more\novercome  by  dismay  and  confusion  as  they\ndrew nearer the house.\n'It's  not  Katerina  Ivanovna  I  am  afraid  of  now,'\nhe muttered in agitation-'and that she will begin", "pulling  my  hair.  What  does  my  hair  matter!\nBother my hair! That's what I say! Indeed it will\nbe better if she does begin pulling it, that's not\nwhat I am afraid of ... it's her eyes I am afraid of\n... yes, her eyes ... the red on her cheeks, too,\nfrightens  me  ...  and  her  breathing  too....  Have\nyou noticed how people in that disease breathe\n... when they are excited? I am frightened of the\nchildren's  crying,  too....  For  if  Sonia  has  not\ntaken  them  food  ...  I  don't  know  what's\nhappened!  I  don't  know!  But  blows  I  am  not\nafraid of.... Know, sir, that such blows are not a\npain  to  me,  but  even  an  enjoyment.  In  fact  I\ncan't  get  on  without  it....  It's  better  so.  Let  her\nstrike me, it relieves her heart ... it's better so ...\nThere  is  the  house.  The  house  of  Kozel,  the\ncabinet-maker  ...  a  German,  well-to-do.  Lead\nthe way!'\nThey went in from the yard and up to the fourth\nstorey.  The  staircase  got  darker  and  darker  as\nthey  went  up.  It  was  nearly  eleven  o'clock  and\nalthough  in  summer  in  Peters  burg  there  is  no\nreal night, yet it was quite dark at the top of the\nstairs.\nA  grimy  little  door  at  the  very  top  of  the  stairs", "stood ajar. A very poor-looking room about ten\npaces long was lighted up by a candle-end; the\nwhole of it was visible from the entrance. It was\nall in disorder, littered up with rags of all sorts,\nespecially  children's  garments.  Across  the\nfurthest  corner  was  stretched  a  ragged  sheet.\nBehind  it  probably  was  the  bed.  There  was\nnothing  in  the  room  except  two  chairs  and  a\nsofa  covered  with  American  leather,  full  of\nholes,  before  which  stood  an  old  deal\nkitchen-table,  unpainted  and  uncovered.  At  the\nedge  of  the  table  stood  a  smoldering\ntallow-candle in an iron candlestick. It appeared\nthat  the  family  had  a  room  to  themselves,  not\npart of a room, but their room was practically a\npassage. The door leading to the other rooms,\nor  rather  cupboards,  into  which  Amalia\nLippevechsel's flat was divided stood half open,\nand  there  was  shouting,  uproar  and  laughter\nwithin. People seemed to be playing cards and\ndrinking  tea  there.  Words  of  the  most\nunceremonious kind flew out from time to time.\nRaskolnikov  recognised  Katerina  Ivanovna  at\nonce.  She  was  a  rather  tall,  slim  and  graceful\nwoman,  terribly  emaciated,  with  magnificent\ndark  brown  hair  and  with  a  hectic  flush  in  her", "cheeks.  She  was  pacing  up  and  down  in  her\nlittle  room,  pressing  her  hands  against  her\nchest; her lips were parched and her breathing\ncame  in  nervous  broken  gasps.  Her  eyes\nglittered  as  in  fever  and  looked  about  with  a\nharsh  immovable  stare.  And  that  consumptive\nand  excited  face  with  the  last  flickering  light  of\nthe  candle-end  playing  upon  (cid:24)  it  made  a\nsickening  impression.  She  seemed  to\nRaskolnikov  about  thirty  years  old  and  was\ncertainly a strange wife for Marmeladov.... She\nhad  not  heard  them  and  did  not  notice  them\ncoming  in.  She  seemed  to  be  lost  in  thought,\nhearing  and  seeing  nothing.  The  room  was\nclose,  but  she  had  not  opened  the  window;  a\nstench rose from the staircase, but the door on\nto  the  stairs  was  not  closed.  From  the  inner\nrooms clouds of tobacco smoke floated in, she\nkept  coughing,  but  did  not  close  the  door.  The\nyoungest child, a girl of six, was asleep, sitting\ncurled up on the floor with her head on the sofa.\nA boy a year older stood crying and shaking in\nthe corner, probably he had just had a beating.\nBeside  him  stood  a  girl  of  nine  years  old,  tall\nand  thin,  wearing  a  thin  and  ragged  chemise\nwith an ancient cashmere pelisse flung over her\nbare  shoulders,  long  outgrown  and  barely", "reaching her knees. Her arm, as thin as a stick,\nwas round her brother's neck. She was trying to\ncomfort him, whispering something to him, and\ndoing  all  she  could  to  keep  him  from\nwhimpering  again.  At  the  same  time  her  large\ndark  eyes,  which  looked  larger  still  from  the\nthinness  of  her  frightened  face,  were  watching\nher  mother  with  alarm.  Marmeladov  did  not\nenter the door, but dropped on his knees in the\nvery  doorway,  pushing  Raskolnikov  in  front  of\nhim.  The  woman  seeing  a  stranger  stopped\nindifferently  facing  him,  coming  to  herself  for  a\nmoment and apparently wondering what he had\ncome for. But evidently she decided that he was\ngoing  into  the  next  room,  as  he  had  to  pass\nthrough  hers  to  get  there.  Taking  no  further\nnotice  of  him,  she  walked  towards  the  outer\ndoor to close it and uttered a sudden scream on\n(cid:24)0  Crime  and  Punishment  seeing  her  husband\non his knees in the doorway.\n'Ah!'  she  cried  out  in  a  frenzy,  'he  has  come\nback!  The  criminal!  the  monster!  ...  And  where\nis the money? What's in your pocket, show me!\nAnd  your  clothes  are  all  different!  Where  are\nyour clothes? Where is the money! Speak!'", "And  she  fell  to  searching  him.  Marmeladov\nsubmissively and obediently held up both arms\nto facilitate the search. Not a farthing was there.\n'Where  is  the  money?'  she  cried-'Mercy  on  us,\ncan  he  have  drunk  it  all?  There  were  twelve\nsilver roubles left in the chest!' and in a fury she\nseized him by the hair and dragged him into the\nroom.  Marmeladov  seconded  her  efforts  by\nmeekly crawling along on his knees.\n'And this is a consolation to me! This does not\nhurt  me,  but  is  a  positive  con-so-la-tion,\nho-nou-red sir,' he called out, shaken to and fro\nby  his  hair  and  even  once  striking  the  ground\nwith his forehead. The child asleep on the floor\nwoke  up,  and  began  to  cry.  The  boy  in  the\ncorner  losing  all  control  began  trembling  and\nscreaming  and  rushed  to  his  sister  in  violent\nterror,  almost  in  a  fit.  The  eldest  girl  was\nshaking like a leaf.'He's  drunk  it!  he's  drunk  it\n  all,'    the    poor    woman  screamed  in  despair\n-'and his clothes are gone! And they are hungry,\nhungry!'-and wringing her hands she pointed to\nthe  children.  'Oh,  accursed  life!  And  you,  are\nyou  not  ashamed?'-she  pounced  all  at  once\nupon  Raskolnikov-'from  the  tavern!  Have  you", "been drinking with him? You have been drinking\nwith him, too! Go away!'\nThe  young  man  was  hastening  away  without\nuttering  a  1  word.  The  inner  door  was  thrown\nwide open and inquisitive faces were peering in\nat  it.  Coarse  laughing  faces  with  pipes  and\ncigarettes  and  heads  wearing  caps  thrust\nthemselves  in  at  the  doorway.  Further  in  could\nbe  seen  figures  in  dressing  gowns  flung  open,\nin  costumes  of  unseemly  scantiness,  some  of\nthem  with  cards  in  their  hands.  They  were\nparticularly  diverted,  when  Marmeladov,\ndragged about by his hair, shouted that it was a\nconsolation  to  him.  They  even  began  to  come\ninto the room; at last a sinister shrill outcry was\nheard:  this  came  from  Amalia  Lippevechsel\nherself  pushing  her  way  amongst  them  and\ntrying to restore order after her own fashion and\nfor  the  hundredth  time  to  frighten  the  poor\nwoman  by  ordering  her  with  coarse  abuse  to\nclear out of the room next day. As he went out,\nRaskolnikov  had  time  to  put  his  hand  into  his\npocket,  to  snatch  up  the  coppers  he  had\nreceived in exchange for his rouble in the tavern\nand  to  lay  them  unnoticed  on  the  window.\nAfterwards  on  the  stairs,  he  changed  his  mind", "and would have gone back.\n'What  a  stupid  thing  I've  done,'  he  thought  to\nhimself, 'they have Sonia and I want it myself.'\nBut reflecting that it would be impossible to take\nit back now and that in any case he would not\nhave taken it, he dismissed it with a wave of his\nhand and went back to his lodging. 'Sonia wants\npomatum  too,'  he  said  as  he  walked  along  the\nstreet,  and  he  laughed  malignantly-'such\nsmartness  costs  money....  Hm!  And  maybe\nSonia  herself  will  be  bankrupt  to-day,  for  there\nis always a risk, hunting big game ... digging for\ngold  ...  then  they  would  all  be  without  a  crust\nto-morrow  except  for  my  money.  Hurrah  for\nSonia!  What  a  mine  they've  dug  there!  And\nthey're  making  the  most  of  it!  Yes,  they  are\nmaking the most of it! They've wept over it and\ngrown used to it. Man grows used to everything,\nthe scoundrel!'\nHe sank into thought.\n'And what if I am wrong,' he cried suddenly after\na moment's thought. 'What if man is not really a\nscoundrel,  man  in  general,  I  mean,  the  whole\nrace  of  mankind-then  all  the  rest  is  prejudice,", "simply artificial terrors and there are no barriers\nand it's all as it should be.'(cid:24) ", "#$#$Chapter 3#$#$\nHe waked up late next day after a broken sleep.\nBut his sleep had not refreshed him; he waked\nup  bilious,  irritable,  ill-tempered,  and  looked\nwith hatred at his room. It was a tiny cupboard\nof  a  room  about  six  paces  in  length.  It  had  a\npoverty-stricken  appearance  with  its  dusty\nyellow paper peeling off the walls, and it was so\nlow-pitched  that  a  man  of  more  than  average\nheight was ill at ease in it and felt every moment\nthat  he  would  knock  his  head  against  the\nceiling.  The  furniture  was  in  keeping  with  the\nroom: there were three old chairs, rather rickety;\na painted table in the corner on which lay a few\nmanuscripts  and  books;  the  dust  that  lay  thick\nupon  them  showed  that  they  had  been  long\nuntouched.  A  big  clumsy  sofa  occupied  almost\nthe whole of one wall and half the floor space of\nthe  room;  it  was  once  covered  with  chintz,  but\nwas  now  in  rags  and  served  Raskolnikov  as  a\nbed.  Often  he  went  to  sleep  on  it,  as  he  was,\nwithout undressing, without sheets, wrapped in\nhis old student's overcoat, with his head on one\nlittle  pillow,  under  which  he  heaped  up  all  the", "linen  he  had,  clean  and  dirty,  by  way  of  a\nbolster. A little table stood in front of the sofa.\nIt  would  have  been  difficult  to  sink  to  a  lower\nebb  of  disorder,  but  to  Raskolnikov  in  his\npresent  state  of  mind  this  was  positively\nagreeable.  He  had  got  completely  away  from\neveryone,  like  a  tortoise  in  its  shell,  and  even\nthe sight of a servant girl who had to wait upon\nhim and looked sometimes into his room made\nhim writhe with nervous irritation. He was in the\ncondition  that  overtakes  some  monomaniacs\nentirely  concentrated  upon  one  thing.  His\nlandlady  had  for  the  last  fortnight  given  up\nsending  him  in  meals,  and  he  had  not  yet\nthought  of  expostulating  with  her,  though  he\nwent without his dinner. Nastasya, the cook and\nonly servant, was rather pleased at the lodger's\nmood  and  had  entirely  given  up  sweeping  and\ndoing  his  room,  only  once  a  week  or  so  she\nwould  stray  into  his  room  with  a  broom.  She\nwaked him up that day.\n'Get up, why are you asleep?' she called to him.\n'It's past nine, I have brought you some tea; will\nyou  have  a  cup?  I  should  think  you're  fairly\nstarving?'", "Raskolnikov  opened  his  eyes,  started  and\nrecognised Nastasya.\n'From  the  landlady,  eh?'  he  asked,  slowly  and\nwith a sickly face sitting up on the sofa.\n'From the landlady, indeed!'\nShe set before him her own cracked teapot full\nof weak and stale tea and laid two yellow lumps\nof sugar by the side of it.\n'Here,  Nastasya,  take  it  please,'  he  said,\nfumbling  in  his  pocket  (for  he  had  slept  in  his\nclothes)  and  taking  out  a  handful  of\ncoppers-'run and buy me a loaf. And get me a\nlittle  sausage,  the  cheapest,  at  the\npork-butcher's.'\n'The  loaf  I'll  fetch  you  this  very  minute,  but\nwouldn't  you  rather  have  some  cabbage  soup\ninstead  of  sausage?  It's  capital  soup,\nyesterday's.  I  saved  it  for  you  yesterday,  but\nyou (cid:24) came in late. It's fine soup.'\nWhen the soup had been brought, and he had", "begun  upon  it,  Nastasya  sat  down  beside  him\non  the  sofa  and  began  chatting.  She  was  a\ncountry  peasant-woman  and  a  very  talkative\none.\n'Praskovya Pavlovna means to complain to the\npolice about you,' she said.\nHe scowled.\n'To the police? What does she want?'\n'You  don't  pay  her  money  and  you  won't  turn\nout  of  the  room.  That's  what  she  wants,  to  be\nsure.'\n'The  devil,  that's  the  last  straw,'  he  muttered,\ngrinding his teeth, 'no, that would not suit me ...\njust now. She is a fool,' he added aloud. 'I'll go\nand talk to her to-day.'\n'Fool  she  is  and  no  mistake,  just  as  I  am.  But\nwhy, if you are so clever, do you lie here like a\nsack and have nothing to show for it? One time\nyou used to go out, you say, to teach children.\nBut why is it you do nothing now?'", "'I  am  doing  ...'  Raskolnikov  began  sullenly  and\nreluctantly.\n'What are you doing?''Work ...'\n'What sort of work?'\n'I  am  thinking,'  he  answered  seriously  after  a\npause.\nNastasya  was  overcome  with  a  fit  of  laughter.\nShe  was  given  to  laughter  and  when  anything\namused  her,  she  laughed  inaudibly,  quivering\nand shaking all over till she felt ill.\n'And  have  you  made  much  money  by  your\nthinking?'  she  managed  to  articulate  at  last.\n'One can't go out to give lessons without boots.\nAnd I'm sick of it.'\n'Don't quarrel with your bread and butter.'\n'They pay so little for lessons. What's the use of\na  few  coppers?'  he  answered,  reluctantly,  as\nthough replying to his own thought.\n'And you want to get a fortune all at once?'", "He looked at her strangely.\n'Yes, I want a fortune,' he answered firmly, after\na brief pause.\n'Don't be in such a hurry, you quite frighten me!\nShall I get you the loaf or not?'\n'As you please.'\n'Ah,  I  forgot!  A  letter  came  for  you  yesterday\nwhen you were out.'\n'A letter? for me! from whom?'\n'I can't say. I gave three copecks of my own to\nthe postman for it. Will you pay me back?'\n'Then  bring  it  to  me,  for  God's  sake,  bring  it,'\ncried Raskolnikov greatly excited-'good God!'\nA minute later the letter was brought him. That\nwas  it:  from  his  mother,  from  the  province  of\nR--.  He  turned  pale  when  he  took  it.  It  was  a\nlong  while  since  he  had  received  a  letter,  but\nanother feeling also suddenly stabbed his heart.", "'Nastasya, leave me alone, for goodness' sake;\nhere are your three copecks, but for goodness'\nsake, make haste and go!'\nThe letter was quivering in his hand; he did not\nwant (cid:24) to open it in her presence; he wanted to\nbe  left  alone  with  this  letter.  When  Nastasya\nhad gone out, he lifted it quickly to his lips and\nkissed it; then he gazed intently at the address,\nthe  small,  sloping  handwriting,  so  dear  and\nfamiliar, of the mother who had once taught him\nto  read  and  write.  He  delayed;  he  seemed\nalmost afraid of something. At last he opened it;\nit  was  a  thick  heavy  letter,  weighing  over  two\nounces,  two  large  sheets  of  note  paper  were\ncovered with very small handwriting.\n'My  dear  Rodya,'  wrote  his  mother-'it's  two\nmonths since I last had a talk with you by letter\nwhich  has  distressed  me  and  even  kept  me\nawake at night, thinking. But I am sure you will\nnot  blame  me  for  my  inevitable  silence.  You\nknow  how  I  love  you;  you  are  all  we  have  to\nlook  to,  Dounia  and  I,  you  are  our  all,  our  one\nhope,  our  one  stay.  What  a  grief  it  was  to  me\nwhen  I  heard  that  you  had  given  up  the", "university some months ago, for want of means\nto  keep  yourself  and  that  you  had  lost  your\nlessons and your other work! How could I help\nyou  out  of  my  hundred  and  twenty  roubles  a\nyear  pension?  The  fifteen  roubles  I  sent  you\nfour  months  ago  I  borrowed,  as  you  know,  on\nsecurity of my pension, from Vassily Ivanovitch\nVahrushin  a  merchant  of  this  town.  He  is  a\nkind-hearted  man  and  was  a  friend  of  your\nfather's  too.  But  having  given  him  the  right  to\nreceive  the  pension,  I  had  to  wait  till  the  debt\nwas paid off and that is only just done, so that\nI've  been  unable  to  send  you  anything  all  this\ntime.  But  now,  thank  God,  I  believe  I  shall  be\nable to send you something more and in fact we\nmay congratulate ourselves on our good fortune\nnow, of which I hasten to inform you. In the first\nplace,  would  you  have  guessed,  dear  Rodya,\nthat your sister has been living with me for the\nlast six weeks and we shall not be separated in\nthe future. Thank God, her sufferings are over,\nbut I will tell you everything in order, so that you\nmay know just how everything  has  happened \nand  all  that  we  have  hitherto concealed from\nyou.  When  you  wrote  to  me  two  months  ago\nthat you had heard that Dounia had a great deal\nto put up with in the Svidrigraïlovs' house, when", "you  wrote  that  and  asked  me  to  tell  you  all\nabout it-what could I write in answer to you? If I\nhad  written  the  whole  truth  to  you,  I  dare  say\nyou would have thrown up everything and have\ncome to us, even if you had to walk all the way,\nfor I know your character and your feelings, and\nyou would not let your sister be insulted. I was\nin  despair  myself,  but  what  could  I  do?  And,\nbesides,  I  did  not  know  the  whole  truth  myself\nthen.  What  made  it  all  so  difficult  was  that\nDounia received a hundred roubles in advance\nwhen  she  took  the  place  as  governess  in  their\nfamily,  on  condition  of  part  of  her  salary  being\ndeducted every month, and so it was impossible\nto  throw  up  the  situation  without  repaying  the\ndebt. This sum (now I can explain it all to you,\nmy precious Rodya) she took chiefly in order to\nsend  you  sixty  roubles,  which  you  needed  so\nterribly  then  and  which  you  received  from  us\nlast  year.  We  deceived  you  then,  writing  that\nthis  money  came  from  Dounia's  savings,  but\nthat was not so, and now I tell you all about it,\nbecause,  thank  God,  things  have  suddenly\nchanged for the better, and that you may know\nhow  Dounia  loves  you  and  what  a  heart  she\nhas. At (cid:24) first indeed Mr. Svidrigaïlov treated her\nvery rudely and used to make disrespectful and", "jeering remarks at table.... But I don't want to go\ninto all those painful details, so as not to worry\nyou for nothing when it is now all over. In short,\nin  spite  of  the  kind  and  generous  behaviour  of\nMarfa  Petrovna,  Mr.  Svidrigaïlov's  wife,  and  all\nthe  rest  of  the  household,  Dounia  had  a  very\nhard  time,  especially  when  Mr.  Svidrigaïlov,\nrelapsing  into  his  old  regimental  habits,  was\nunder  the  influence  of  Bacchus.  And  how  do\nyou  think  it  was  all  explained  later  on?  Would\nyou believe that the crazy fellow had conceived\na  passion  for  Dounia  from  the  beginning,  but\nhad concealed it under a show of rudeness and\ncontempt.  Possibly  he  was  ashamed  and\nhorrified  himself  at  his  own  flighty  hopes,\nconsidering his years and his being the father of\na family; and that made him angry with Dounia.\nAnd  possibly,  too,  he  hoped  by  his  rude  and\nsneering  behaviour  to  hide  the  truth  from\nothers. But at last he lost all control and had the\nface  to  make  Dounia  an  open  and  shameful\nproposal, promising her all sorts of inducements\nand  offering,  besides,  to  throw  up  everything\nand  take  her  to  another  estate  of  his,  or  even\nabroad. You can imagine all she went through!\nTo  leave  her  situation  at  once  was  impossible\nnot only on account of the money debt, but also", "to spare the feelings of Marfa Petrovna, whose\nsuspicions would have been aroused: and then\nDounia would have been the cause of a rupture\nin the family. And it would have meant a terrible\nscandal  for  Dounia  too;  that  would  have  been\ninevitable.  There  were  various  other  reasons\nowing  to  which  Dounia  could  not  hope  to\nescape  from  that  awful  (cid:24)0  Crime  and\nPunishment  house  for  another  six  weeks.  You\nknow  Dounia,  of  course;  you  know  how  clever\nshe  is  and  what  a  strong  will  she  has.  Dounia\ncan  endure  a  great  deal  and  even  in  the  most\ndifficult cases she has the fortitude to maintain\nher  firmness.  She  did  not  even  write  to  me\nabout  everything  for  fear  of  upsetting  me,\nalthough we were constantly in communication. \nIt    all    ended    very    unexpectedly.    Marfa \nPetrovna  accidentally  overheard  her  husband\nimploring  Dounia  in  the  garden,  and,  putting\nquite  a  wrong  interpretation  on  the  position,\nthrew  the  blame  upon  her,  believing  her  to  be\nthe  cause  of  it  all.  An  awful  scene  took  place\nbetween them on the spot in the garden; Marfa\nPetrovna  went  so  far  as  to  strike  Dounia,\nrefused  to  hear  anything  and  was  shouting  at\nher for a whole hour and then gave orders that\nDounia should be packed off at once to me in a", "plain peasant's cart, into which they flung all her\nthings,  her  linen  and  her  clothes,  all  pell-mell,\nwithout folding it up and packing it. And a heavy\nshower  of  rain  came  on,  too,  and  Dounia,\ninsulted  and  put  to  shame,  had  to  drive  with  a\npeasant in an open cart all the seventeen versts\ninto  town.  Only  think  now  what  answer  could  I\nhave  sent  to  the  letter  I  received  from  you  two\nmonths  ago  and  what  could  I  have  written?  I\nwas in despair; I dared not write to you the truth\nbecause  you  would  have  been  very  unhappy,\nmortified and indignant, and yet what could you\ndo? You could only perhaps ruin yourself, and,\nbesides,  Dounia  would  not  allow  it;  and  fill  up\nmy letter with trifles when my heart was so full\nof  sorrow,  I  could  not.  For  a  whole  month  the\ntown was full of gossip about this scandal, and\nit  came  to  such  a  pass  that  1  Dounia  and  I\ndared not even go to church on account of the\ncontemptuous  looks,  whispers,  and  even\nremarks  made  aloud  about  us.  All  our\nacquaintances avoided us, nobody even bowed\nto  us  in  the  street,  and  I  learnt  that  some\nshopmen and clerks were intending to insult us\nin  a  shameful  way,  smearing  the  gates  of  our\nhouse with pitch, so that the landlord began to\ntell us we must leave. All this was set going by", "Marfa  Petrovna  who  managed  to  slander\nDounia  and  throw  dirt  at  her  in  every  family.\nShe knows everyone in the neighbourhood, and\nthat month she was continually coming into the\ntown, and as she is rather talkative and fond of\ngossiping  about  her  family  affairs  and\nparticularly of complaining to all and each of her\nhusband-which  is  not  at  all  right  -so  in  a  short\ntime  she  had  spread  her  story  not  only  in  the\ntown, but over the whole surrounding district. It\nmade me ill, but Dounia bore it better than I did,\nand  if  only  you  could  have  seen  how  she\nendured it all and tried to comfort me and cheer\nme  up!  She  is  an  angel!  But  by  God's  mercy,\nour  sufferings  were  cut  short:  Mr.  Svidrigaïlov\nreturned  to  his  senses  and  repented  and,\nprobably feeling sorry for Dounia, he laid before\nMarfa  Petrovna  a  complete  and  unmistakable\nproof  of  Dounia's  innocence,  in  the  form  of  a\nletter Dounia had been forced to write and give\nto him, before Marfa Petrovna came upon them\nin the garden. This letter, which remained in Mr.\nSvidrigaïlov's  hands  after  her  departure,  she\nhad written to refuse personal explanations and\nsecret  interviews,  for  which  he  was  entreating\nher. In that letter she reproached him with great\nheat  and  indignation  for  the  baseness  of  his", "behaviour  in  regard  to  Marfa  Petrovna,\nreminding him that he was the father and head\nof a family and telling him how infamous it was\nof  him  to  torment  and  make  unhappy  a\ndefenceless  girl,  unhappy  enough  already.\nIndeed, dear Rodya, the letter was so nobly and\ntouchingly  written  that  I  sobbed  when  I  read  it\nand  to  this  day  I  cannot  read  it  without  tears.\nMoreover,  the  evidence  of  the  servants,  too,\ncleared Dounia's reputation; they had seen and\nknown  a  great  deal  more  than  Mr.  Svidrigaïlov\nhad himself supposed -as indeed is always the\ncase  with  servants.  Marfa  Petrovna  was\ncompletely taken aback, and 'again crushed' as\nshe said herself to us, but she was completely\nconvinced of Dounia's innocence. The very next\nday,  being  Sunday,  she  went  straight  to  the\nCathedral, knelt down and prayed with tears to\nOur Lady to give her strength to bear this new\ntrial and to do her duty. Then she came straight\nfrom  the  Cathedral  to  us,  told  us  the  whole\nstory,  wept  bitterly  and,  fully  penitent,  she\nembraced  Dounia  and  besought  her  to  forgive\nher. The same morning without any delay, she\nwent  round  to  all  the  houses  in  the  town  and\neverywhere, shedding tears, she asserted in the\nmost  flattering  terms  Dounia's  innocence  and", "the  nobility  of  her  feelings  and  her  behavior.\nWhat  was  more,  she  showed  and  read  to\neveryone the letter in Dounia's own handwriting\nto  Mr.  Svidrigaïlov  and  even  allowed  them  to\ntake  copies  of  it-which  I  must  say  I  think  was\nsuperfluous.  In  this  way  she  was  busy  for\nseveral  days  in  driving  about  the  whole  town,\nbecause  some  people  had  taken  offence\nthrough  precedence  having  been  given  to\nothers. And therefore they had to take turns, so\nthat  in  every  house  she  was  expected  before\nshe ar-(cid:24) rived, and everyone knew that on such\nand  such  a  day  Marfa  Petrovna  would  be\nreading the letter in such and such a place and\npeople assembled for every reading of it, even\nmany  who  had  heard  it  several  times  already\nboth in their own houses and in other people's.\nIn my opinion a great deal, a very great deal of\nall  this  was  unnecessary;  but  that's  Marfa\nPetrovna's character. Anyway she succeeded in\ncompletely  re-establishing  Dounia's  reputation\n and  the whole ignominy of this affair rested as\nan indelible disgrace upon her husband, as the\nonly  person  to  blame,  so  that  I  really  began  to\nfeel sorry for him; it was really treating the crazy\nfellow too harshly. Dounia was at once asked to\ngive  lessons  in  several  families,  but  she", "refused.  All  of  a  sudden  everyone  began  to\ntreat  her  with  marked  respect  and  all  this  did\nmuch  to  bring  about  the  event  by  which,  one\nmay  say,  our  whole  fortunes  are  now\ntransformed. You must know, dear Rodya, that\nDounia  has  a  suitor  and  that  she  has  already\nconsented to marry him. I hasten to tell you all\nabout  the  matter,  and  though  it  has  been\narranged  without  asking  your  consent,  I  think\nyou  will  not  be  aggrieved  with  me  or  with  your\nsister  on  that  account,  for  you  will  see  that  we\ncould  not  wait  and  put  off  our  decision  till  we\nheard from you. And you could not have judged\nall the facts without being on the spot. This was\nhow it happened. He is already of the rank of a\ncounsellor,  Pyotr  Petrovitch  Luzhin,  and  is\ndistantly  related  to  Marfa  Petrovna,  who  has\nbeen very active in bringing the match about. It\nbegan  with  his  expressing  through  her  his\ndesire  to  make  our  acquaintance.  He  was\nproperly received, drank coffee with us and the\nvery  next  day  he  sent  us  a  letter  in  which  he\nvery courteously made an offer and begged for\na  speedy  and  decided  answer.  He  is  a  very\nbusy  man  and  is  in  a  great  hurry  to  get  to\nPetersburg, so that every moment is precious to\nhim.  At  first,  of  course,  we  were  greatly", "surprised, as it had all happened so quickly and\nunexpectedly. We thought and talked it over the\nwhole  day.  He  is  a  well-to-do  man,  to  be\ndepended  upon,  he  has  two  posts  in  the\ngovernment and has already made his fortune.\nIt is true that he is forty-five years old, but he is\nof a fairly prepossessing appearance and might\nstill  be  thought  attractive  by  women,  and  he  is\naltogether  a  very  respectable  and  presentable\nman,  only  he  seems  a  little  morose  and\nsomewhat conceited. But possibly that may only\nbe  the  impression  he  makes  at  first  sight.  And\nbeware,  dear  Rodya,  when  he  comes  to\nPetersburg,  as  he  shortly  will  do,  beware  of\njudging  him  too  hastily  and  severely,  as  your\nway is, if there is anything you do not like in him\nat first sight. I give you this warning, although I\nfeel  sure  that  he  will  make  a  favourable\nimpression  upon  you.  Moreover,  in  order  to\nunderstand  any  man  one  must  be  deliberate\nand  careful  to  avoid  forming  prejudices  and\nmistaken  ideas,  which  are  very  difficult  to\ncorrect  and  get  over  afterwards.  And  Pyotr\nPetrovitch,  judging  by  many  indications,  is  a\nthoroughly  estimable  man.  At  his  first  visit,\nindeed, he told us that he was a practical man,\nbut still he shares, as he expressed it, many of", "the  convictions  'of  our  most  rising  generation'\nand he is an opponent of all prejudices. He said\na  good  deal  more,  for  he  seems  a  little\nconceited and likes to be listened to, but this is\nscarcely  a  vice.  I,  of  course,  understood  very\nlittle  of  (cid:24)  it,  but  Dounia  explained  to  me  that,\nthough he is not a man of great education, he is\nclever  and  seems  to  be  good-natured.  You\nknow  your  sister's  character,  Rodya.  She  is  a\nresolute, sensible, patient and generous girl, but\nshe has a passionate heart, as I know very well.\nOf  course,  there  is  no  great  love  either  on  his\nside, or on hers, but Dounia is a clever girl and\nhas the heart of an angel, and will make it her\nduty  to  make  her  husband  happy  who  on  his\nside  will  make  her  happiness  his  care.  Of  that\nwe  have  no  good  reason  to  doubt,  though  it\nmust be admitted the matter has been arranged\nin  great  haste.  Besides  he  is  a  man  of  great\nprudence and he will see, to be sure, of himself,\nthat his own happiness will be the more secure,\nthe happier Dounia is with him. And as for some\ndefects of character, for some habits and even\ncertain differences of opinion -which indeed are\ninevitable  even  in  the  happiest  marriages-\nDounia  has  said  that,  as  regards  all  that,  she\nrelies  on  herself,  that  there  is  nothing  to  be", "uneasy  about,  and  that  she  is  ready  to  put  up\nwith a great deal, if only their future relationship\ncan be an honourable and straightforward one.\nHe  struck  me,  for  instance,  at  first,  as  rather\nabrupt,  but  that  may  well  come  from  his  being\nan outspoken man, and that is no doubt how it\nis. For instance, at his second visit, after he had\nreceived  Dounia's  consent,  in  the  course  of\nconversation,  he  declared  that  before  making\nDounia's  acquaintance,  he  had  made  up  his\nmind to marry a girl of good reputation, without\ndowry and, above all, one who had experienced\npoverty, because, as he explained, a man ought\nnot to be indebted to his wife, but that it is better\nfor  a  wife  to  look  upon  her  husband  as  her\nbenefactor.  I  must  add  that  he  expressed  it\nmore nicely and politely than I have done, for I\nhave  forgotten  his  actual  phrases  and  only\nremember  the  meaning.  And,  besides,  it  was\nobviously not said of design, but slipped out in\nthe  heat  of  conversation,  so  that  he  tried\nafterwards  to  correct  himself  and  smooth  it\nover,  but  all  the  same  it  did  strike  me  as\nsomewhat  rude,  and  I  said  so  afterwards  to\nDounia.  But  Dounia  was  vexed,  and  answered\nthat 'words are not deeds,' and that, of course,\nis  perfectly  true.  Dounia  did  not  sleep  all  night", "before she made up her mind, and, thinking that\nI  was  asleep,  she  got  out  of  bed  and  was\nwalking up and down the room all night; at last\nshe knelt down before the ikon and prayed long\nand  fervently  and  in  the  morning  she  told  me\nthat she had decided.\n'I have mentioned already that Pyotr Petrovitch\nis just setting off for Petersburg, where he has a\ngreat deal of business, and he wants to open a\nlegal  bureau.  He  has  been  occupied  for  many\nyears  in  conducting  civil  and  commercial\nlitigation,  and  only  the  other  day  he  won  an\nimportant  case.  He  has  to  be  in  Petersburg\nbecause  he  has  an  important  case  before  the\nSenate.  So,  Rodya  dear,  he  may  be  of  the\ngreatest  use  to  you,  in  every  way  indeed,  and\nDounia  and  I  have  agreed  that  from  this  very\nday you could definitely enter upon your career\nand  might  consider  that  your  future  is  marked\nout and assured for you. Oh, if only this comes\nto  pass!  This  would  be  such  a  benefit  that  we\ncould  only  look  upon  it  as  a  providential\nblessing.  Dounia  is  dreaming  of  nothing  else.\nWe  have  even  ventured  already  to  drop  a  few\nwords  on  the  subject  to  Pyotr  Petrovitch.  He\nwas  cautious  in  (cid:24)  his  answer,  and  said  that,  of", "course,  as  he  could  not  get  on  without  a\nsecretary,  it  would  be  better  to  be  paying  a\nsalary to a relation than to a stranger, if only the\nformer  were  fitted  for  the  duties  (as  though\nthere  could  be  doubt  of  your  being  fitted!)  but\nthen he expressed doubts whether your studies\nat the university would leave you time for work\nat  his  office.  The  matter  dropped  for  the  time,\nbut Dounia is thinking of nothing else now. She\nhas been in a sort of fever for the last few days,\nand  has  already  made  a  regular  plan  for  your\nbecoming  in  the  end  an  associate  and  even  a\npartner  in  Pyotr  Petrovitch's  business,  which\nmight well be, seeing that you are a student of\nlaw.  I  am  in  complete  agreement  with  her,\nRodya, and share all her plans and hopes, and\nthink there is every probability of realising them.\nAnd  in  spite  of  Pyotr  Petrovitch's  evasiveness,\nvery natural at present (since he does not know\nyou),  Dounia  is  firmly  persuaded  that  she  will\ngain everything by her good influence over her\nfuture  husband;  this  she  is  reckoning  upon.  Of\ncourse we are careful not to talk of any of these\nmore  remote  plans  to  Pyotr  Petrovitch,\nespecially of your becoming his partner. He is a\npractical man and might take this very coldly, it\nmight all seem to him simply a day-dream. Nor", "has either Dounia or I breathed a word to him of\nthe  great  hopes  we  have  of  his  helping  us  to\npay  for  your  university  studies;  we  have  not\nspoken  of  it  in  the  first  place,  because  it  will\ncome  to  pass  of  itself,  later  on,  and  he  will  no\ndoubt  without  wasting  words  offer  to  do  it  of\nhimself, (as though he could refuse Dounia that)\nthe  more  readily  since  you  may  by  your  own\nefforts become his right hand in the office, and\nreceive this assistance not as a charity, but as a\nsalary earned by your own work. Dounia wants\nto  arrange  it  all  like  this  and  I  quite  agree  with\nher.  And  we  have  not  spoken  of  our  plans  for\nanother  reason,  that  is,  because  I  particularly\nwanted  you  to  feel  on  an  equal  footing  when\nyou first meet him. When Dounia spoke to him\nwith  enthusiasm  about  you,  he  answered  that\none could never judge of a man without seeing\nhim  close,  for  oneself,  and  that  he  looked\nforward  to  forming  his  own  opinion  when  he\nmakes  your  acquaintance.  Do  you  know,  my\nprecious  Rodya,  I  think  that  perhaps  for  some\nreasons  (nothing  to  do  with  Pyotr  Petrovitch\nthough,  simply  for  my  own  personal,  perhaps\nold- womanish, fancies) I should do better to go\non living by myself, apart, than with them, after\nthe  wedding.  I  am  convinced  that  he  will  be", "generous and delicate enough to invite me and\nto  urge  me  to  remain  with  my  daughter  for  the\nfuture,  and  if  he  has  said  nothing  about  it\nhitherto, it is simply because it has been taken\nfor  granted;  but  I  shall  refuse.  I  have  noticed\nmore  than  once  in  my  life  that  husbands  don't\nquite  get  on  with  their  mothers-in-  law,  and  I\ndon't  want  to  be  the  least  bit  in  anyone's  way,\nand for my own sake, too, would rather be quite\nindependent, so long as I have a crust of bread\nof  my  own,  and  such  children  as  you  and\nDounia.  If  possible,  I  would  settle  somewhere\nnear you, for the most joyful piece of news, dear\nRodya,  I  have  kept  for  the  end  of  my  letter:\nknow then, my dear boy, that we may, perhaps,\nbe  all  together  in  a  very  short  time  and  may\nembrace  one  another  again  after  a  separation\nof  almost  three  years!  It  is  settled  for  certain\nthat Dounia and I are to set off for Petersburg,\nexactly when I (cid:24) don't know, but very, very soon,\npossibly  in  a  week.  It  all  depends  on  Pyotr\nPetrovitch  who  will  let  us  know  when  he  has\nhad  time  to  look  round  him  in  Petersburg.  To\nsuit  his  own  arrangements  he  is  anxious  to\nhave  the  ceremony  as  soon  as  possible,  even\nbefore  the  fast  of  Our  Lady,  if  it  could  be\nmanaged,  or  if  that  is  too  soon  to  be  ready,", "immediately  after.  Oh,  with  what  happiness  I\nshall  press  you  to  my  heart!  Dounia  is  all\nexcitement  at  the  joyful  thought  of  seeing  you,\nshe  said  one  day  in  joke  that  she  would  be\nready  to  marry  Pyotr  Petrovitch  for  that  alone.\nShe  is  an  angel!  She  is  not  writing  anything  to\nyou now, and has only told me to write that she\nhas so much, so much to tell you that she is not\ngoing  to  take  up  her  pen  now,  for  a  few  lines\nwould tell you nothing, and it would only mean\nupsetting  herself;  she  bids  me  send  you  her\nlove  and  innumerable  kisses.  But  although  we\nshall be meeting so soon, perhaps I shall send\nyou  as  much  money  as  I  can  in  a  day  or  two.\nNow that everyone has heard that Dounia is to\nmarry Pyotr Petrovitch, my credit has suddenly\nimproved  and  I  know  that  Afanasy  Ivanovitch\nwill  trust  me  now  even  to  seventy-five  roubles\non the security of my pension, so that perhaps I\nshall  be  able  to  send  you  twenty-five  or  even\nthirty roubles. I would send you more, but I am\nuneasy  about  our  travelling  expenses;  for\nthough Pyotr Petrovitch has been so kind as to\nundertake  part  of  the  expenses  of  the  journey,\nthat  is  to  say,  he  has  taken  upon  himself  the\nconveyance  of  our  bags  and  big  trunk  (which\nwill  be  conveyed  through  some  acquaintances", "of his), we must reckon upon some expense on\nour arrival in Petersburg, where we can't be left\nwithout  a  halfpenny,  (cid:24)0  Crime  and  Punishment\nat  least  for  the  first  few  days.  But  we  have\ncalculated it all, Dounia and I, to the last penny,\nand  we  see  that  the  journey  will  not  cost  very\nmuch.  It  is  only  ninety  versts  from  us  to  the\nrailway  and  we  have  come  to  an  agreement\nwith a driver we know, so as to be in readiness;\nand  from  there  Dounia  and  I  can  travel  quite\ncomfortably third class. So that I may very likely\nbe able to send to you not twenty-five, but thirty\nroubles. But enough; I have covered two sheets\nalready and there is no space left for more; our\nwhole  history,  but  so  many  events  have\nhappened!  And  now,  my  precious  Rodya,  I\nembrace you and send you a mother's blessing\ntill  we  meet.  Love  Dounia  your  sister,  Rodya;\nlove her as she loves you and understand that\nshe  loves  you  beyond  everything,  more  than\nherself.  She  is  an  angel  and  you,  Rodya,  you\nare  everything  to  us-our  one  hope,  our  one\nconsolation. If only you are happy, we shall be\nhappy.  Do  you  still  say  your  prayers,  Rodya,\nand believe in the mercy of our Creator and our\nRedeemer?  I  am  afraid  in  my  heart  that  you\nmay  have  been  visited  by  the  new  spirit  of", "infidelity  that  is  abroad  today;  If  it  is  so,  I  pray\nfor  you.  Remember,  dear  boy,  how  in  your\nchildhood,  when  your  father  was  living,  you\nused to lisp your prayers at my knee, and how\nhappy we all were in those days. Good-bye, till\nwe  meet  then-  I  embrace  you  warmly,  warmly,\nwith many kisses.\n'Yours till death,\n'PULCHERIA RASKOLNIKOV.'\nAlmost  from  the  first,  while  he  read  the  letter,\nRaskolnikov's face was wet with tears; but when\nhe  finished  it,  his  face  was  pale  and  distorted\nand  a  bitter,  wrathful  and  ma-1  lignant  smile\nwas  on  his  lips.  He  laid  his  head  down  on  his\nthreadbare dirty pillow and pondered, pondered\na long time. His heart was beating violently, and\nhis  brain  was  in  a  turmoil.  At  last  he  felt\ncramped and stifled in the little yellow room that\nwas like a cupboard or a box. His eyes and his\nmind craved for space. He took up his hat and\nwent  out,  this  time  without  dread  of  meeting\nanyone;  he  had  forgotten  his  dread.  He  turned\nin  the  direction  of  the  Vassilyevsky  Ostrov,\nwalking along Vassilyevsky Prospect, as though", "hastening on some business, but he walked, as\nhis  habit  was,  without  noticing  his  way,\nmuttering  and  even  speaking  aloud  to  himself,\nto the astonishment of the passers-by. Many of\nthem took him to be drunk. ", "#$#$Chapter 4#$#$\nHis  mother's  letter  had  been  a  torture  to  him,\nbut as regards the chief fact in it, he had felt not\none  moment's  hesitation,  even  whilst  he  was\nreading  the  letter.  The  essential  question  was\nsettled,  and  irrevocably  settled,  in  his  mind:\n'Never such a marriage while I am alive and Mr.\nLuzhin be damned!' 'The thing is perfectly clear,'\nhe  muttered  to  himself,  with  a  malignant  smile\nanticipating  the  triumph  of  his  decision.  'No,\nmother, no, Dounia, you won't deceive me! and\nthen  they  apologise  for  not  asking  my  advice\nand  for  taking  the  decision  without  me!  I  dare\nsay! They imagine it is arranged now and can't\nbe broken off; but we will see whether it can or\nnot!  A  magnificent  excuse:  'Pyotr  Petrovitch  is\nsuch a busy man that even his wedding has to\nbe  in  post-haste,  almost  by  express.'  No,\nDounia, I see it all and I know what you want to\nsay  to  me;  and  I  know  too  what  you  were\nthinking  about,  when  you  walked  up  and  down\nall night, and what your prayers were like before\nthe  Holy  Mother  of  Kazan  who  stands  in\nmother's  bedroom.  Bitter  is  the  ascent  to", "Golgotha....  Hm  ...  so  it  is  finally  settled;  you\nhave  determined  to  marry  a  sensible  business\nman,  Avdotya  Romanovna,  one  who  has  a\nfortune (has already made his fortune, that is so\nmuch  more  solid  and  impressive)  a  man  who\nholds  two  government  posts  and  who  shares\nthe  ideas  of  our  most  rising  generation,  as\nmother writes, and who (cid:24) seems to be kind, as\nDounia  herself  observes.  That  seems  beats\neverything!  And  that  very  Dounia  for  that  very\n'seems' is marrying him! Splendid! splendid!\n'...  But  I  should  like  to  know  why  mother  has\nwritten to me about 'our most rising generation'?\nSimply  as  a  descriptive  touch,  or  with  the  idea\nof  prepossessing  me  in  favour  of  Mr.  Luzhin?\nOh,  the  cunning  of  them!  I  should  like  to  know\none  thing  more:  how  far  they  were  open  with\none another that day and night and all this time\nsince?  Was  it  all  put  into  words  or  did  both\nunderstand  that  they  had  the  same  thing  at\nheart  and  in  their  minds,  so  that  there  was  no\nneed  to  speak  of  it  aloud,  and  better  not  to\nspeak  of  it.  Most  likely  it  was  partly  like  that,\nfrom mother's letter it's evident: he struck her as\nrude a little and mother in her simplicity took her\nobservations to Dounia. And she was sure to be", "vexed and 'answered her angrily.' I should think\nso!  Who  would  not  be  angered  when  it  was\nquite  clear  without  any  naïve  questions  and\nwhen  it  was  understood  that  it  was  useless  to\ndiscuss it. And why does she write to me, 'love\nDounia,  Rodya,  and  she  loves  you  more  than\nherself'?  Has  she  a  secret  conscience-prick  at\nsacrificing  her  daughter  to  her  son?  'You  are\nour one comfort, you are everything to us.' Oh,\nmother!'\nHis bitterness grew more and more intense, and\nif  he  had  happened  to  meet  Mr.  Luzhin  at  the\nmoment, he might have murdered him.\n'Hm  ...  yes,  that's  true,'  he  continued,  pursuing\nthe whirling ideas that chased each other in his\nbrain,  'it  is  true  that  'it  needs  time  and  care  to\nget  to  know  a  man,'  but  there  is  no  mistake\nabout Mr. Luzhin. The chief thing is he is 'a man\nof  business  and  seems  kind,'  that  was\nsomething,  wasn't  it,  to  send  the  bags  and  big\nbox  for  them!  A  kind  man,  no  doubt  after  that!\nBut  his  bride  and  her  mother  are  to  drive  in  a\npeasant's  cart  covered  with  sacking  (I  know,  I\nhave  been  driven  in  it).  No  matter!  It  is  only\nninety  versts  and  then  they  can  'travel  very", "comfortably,  third  class,'  for  a  thousand  versts!\nQuite  right,  too.  One  must  cut  one's  coat\naccording  to  one's  cloth,  but  what  about  you,\nMr. Luzhin? She is your bride.... And you must\nbe aware that her mother has to raise money on\nher  pension  for  the  journey.  To  be  sure  it's  a\nmatter  of  business,  a  partnership  for  mutual\nbenefit,  with  equal  shares  and  expenses;-food\nand  drink  provided,  but  pay  for  your  tobacco.\nThe  business  man  has  got  the  better  of  them,\ntoo.  The  luggage  will  cost  less  than  their  fares\nand very likely go for nothing. How is it that they\ndon't  both  see  all  that,  or  is  it  that  they  don't\nwant  to  see?  And  they  are  pleased,  pleased!\nAnd  to  think  that  this  is  only  the  first\nblossoming, and that the real fruits are to come!\nBut what really matters is not the stinginess, is\nnot  the  meanness,  but  the  tone  of  the  whole\nthing.  For  that  will  be  the  tone  after  marriage,\nit's a foretaste of it. And mother too, why should\nshe  be  so  lavish?  What  will  she  have  by  the\ntime  she  gets  to  Petersburg?  Three  silver\nroubles or two 'paper ones' as she says.... that\nold woman ... hm. What does she expect to live\nupon  in  Petersburg  afterwards?  She  has  her\nreasons already for guessing that she could not\nlive with Dounia after the marriage, even for the", "first  few  months.  The  good  man  has  no  doubt\nlet slip something on that sub-(cid:24) ject also, though\nmother would deny it: 'I shall refuse,' says she.\nOn  whom  is  she  reckoning  then?  Is  she\ncounting  on  what  is  left  of  her  hundred  and\ntwenty  roubles  of  pension  when  Afanasy\nIvanovitch's  debt  is  paid?  She  knits  woollen\nshawls  and  embroiders  cuffs,  ruining  her  old\neyes.  And  all  her  shawls  don't  add  more  than\ntwenty  roubles  a  year  to  her  hundred  and\ntwenty,  I  know  that.  So  she  is  building  all  her\nhopes  all  the  time  on  Mr.  Luzhin's  generosity;\n'he will offer it of himself, he will press it on me.'\nYou may wait a long time for that! That's how it\nalways is with these Schilleresque noble hearts;\ntill the last moment every goose is a swan with\nthem,  till  the  last  moment,  they  hope  for  the\nbest  and  will  see  nothing  wrong,  and  although\nthey  have  an  inkling  of  the  other  side  of  the\npicture, yet they won't face the truth till they are\nforced  to;  the  very  thought  of  it  makes  them\nshiver;  they  thrust  the  truth  away  with  both\nhands,  until  the  man  they  deck  out  in  false\ncolours puts a fool's cap on them with his own\nhands. I should like to know whether Mr. Luzhin\nhas any orders of merit; I bet he has the Anna\nin his buttonhole and that he puts it on when he", "goes to dine with contractors or merchants. He\nwill  be  sure  to  have  it  for  his  wedding,  too!\nEnough of him, confound him!\n'Well,  ...  mother  I  don't  wonder  at,  it's  like  her,\nGod  bless  her,  but  how  could  Dounia?  Dounia\ndarling, as though I did not know you! You were\nnearly twenty when I saw you last: I understood\nyou then. Mother writes that 'Dounia can put up\nwith a great deal.' I know that very well. I knew\nthat  two  years  and  a  half  ago,  and  for  the  last\ntwo and a half years I have been thinking about\nit,  thinking  of  just  that,  that  'Dounia  can  put  up\nwith  a  great  deal.'  If  she  could  put  up  with  Mr.\nSvidrigaïlov  and  all  the  rest  of  it,  she  certainly\ncan  put  up  with  a  great  deal.  And  now  mother\nand she have taken it into their heads that she\ncan put up with Mr. Luzhin, who propounds the\ntheory  of  the  superiority  of  wives  raised  from\ndestitution  and  owing  everything  to  their\nhusband's bounty-who propounds it, too, almost\nat the first interview. Granted that he 'let it slip,'\nthough he is a sensible man, (yet maybe it was\nnot  a  slip  at  all,  but  he  meant  to  make  himself\nclear as soon as possible) but Dounia, Dounia?\nShe  understands  the  man,  of  course,  but  she\nwill have to live with the man. Why! she'd live on", "black  bread  and  water,  she  would  not  sell  her\nsoul,  she  would  not  barter  her  moral  freedom\nfor  comfort;  she  would  not  barter  it  for  all\nSchleswig-Holstein,  much  less  Mr.  Luzhin's\nmoney.  No,  Dounia  was  not  that  sort  when  I\nknew her and ... she is still the same, of course!\nYes, there's no denying, the Svidrigaïlovs are a\nbitter pill! It's a bitter thing to spend one's life a\ngoverness  in  the  provinces  for  two  hundred\nroubles,  but  I  know  she  would  rather  be  a\nnigger on a plantation or a Lett with a German\nmaster  than  degrade  her  soul,  and  her  moral\ndignity,  by  binding  herself  for  ever  to  a  man\nwhom she does not respect and with whom she\nhas nothing in common-for her own advantage.\nAnd if Mr. Luzhin had been of unalloyed gold, or\none  huge  diamond,  she  would  never  have\nconsented to become his legal concubine. Why\nis she consenting then? What's the point of it?\nWhat's  the  answer?  It's  clear  enough:  for\nherself,  for  her  comfort,  to  save  her  life  she\nwould not sell herself, but for someone else she\nis  doing  (cid:24)  it!  For  one  she  loves,  for  one  she\nadores,  she  will  sell  herself!  That's  what  it  all\namounts to; for her brother, for her mother, she\nwill sell herself! She will sell everything! In such\ncases,  'we  overcome  our  moral  feeling  if", "necessary,'  freedom,  peace,  conscience  even,\nall,  all  are  brought  into  the  market.  Let  my  life\ngo,  if  only  my  dear  ones  may  be  happy!  More\nthan  that,  we  become  casuists,  we  learn  to  be\nJesuitical and for a time maybe we can soothe\nourselves, we can persuade ourselves that it is\none's duty for a good object. That's just like us,\nit's  as  clear  as  daylight.  It's  clear  that  Rodion\nRomanovitch Raskolnikov is the central figure in\nthe  business,  and  no  one  else.  Oh,  yes,  she\ncan  ensure  his  happiness,  keep  him  in  the\nuniversity,  make  him  a  partner  in  the  office,\nmake his whole future secure; perhaps he may\neven  be  a  rich  man  later  on,  prosperous,\nrespected, and may even end his life a famous\nman!  But  my  mother?  It's  all  Rodya,  precious\nRodya, her first born! For such a son who would\nnot  sacrifice  such  a  daughter!  Oh,  loving,\nover-partial hearts! Why, for his sake we would\nnot shrink even from Sonia's fate. Sonia, Sonia\nMarmeladov,  the  eternal  victim  so  long  as  the\nworld  lasts.  Have  you  taken  the  measure  of\nyour sacrifice, both of you? Is it right? Can you\nbear it? Is it any use? Is there sense in it? And\nlet me tell you, Dounia, Sonia's life is no worse\nthan  life  with  Mr.  Luzhin.  'There  can  be  no\nquestion  of  love,'  mother  writes.  And  what  if", "there can be no respect either, if on the contrary\nthere  is  aversion,  contempt,  repulsion,  what\nthen?  So  you  will  have  to  'keep  up  your\nappearance,'  too.  Is  not  that  so?  Do  you\nunderstand  what  that  smartness  means?  Do\nyou  understand  that  the  Luzhin  smartness  is\njust  the  same  thing  as  Sonia's  and  may  be\nworse,  viler,  baser,  because  in  your  case,\nDounia,  it's  a  bargain  for  luxuries,  after  all,  but\nwith Sonia it's simply a question of starvation. It\nhas to be paid for, it has to be paid for, Dounia,\nthis  smartness.  And  what  if  it's  more  than  you\ncan  bear  afterwards,  if  you  regret  it?  The\nbitterness,  the  misery,  the  curses,  the  tears\nhidden  from  all  the  world,  for  you  are  not  a\nMarfa  Petrovna.  And  how  will  your  mother  feel\nthen? Even now she is uneasy, she is worried,\nbut  then,  when  she  sees  it  all  clearly?  And  I?\nYes,  indeed,  what  have  you  taken  me  for?  I\nwon't have your sacrifice, Dounia, I won't have\nit, mother! It shall not be, so long as I am alive,\nit shall not, it shall not! I won't accept it!'\nHe suddenly paused in his reflection and stood\nstill.\n'It shall not be? But what are you going to do to", "prevent it? You'll forbid it? And what right have\nyou? What can you promise them on your side\nto  give  you  such  a  right?  Your  whole  life,  your\nwhole future, you will devote to them when you\nhave finished your studies and obtained a post?\nYes, we have heard all that before, and that's all\nwords but now? Now something must be done,\nnow, do you understand that? And what are you\ndoing  now?  You  are  living  upon  them.  They\nborrow on their hundred roubles pension. They\nborrow  from  the  Svidrigaïlovs.  How  are  you\ngoing  to  save  them  from  Svidrigaïlovs,  from\nAfanasy  Ivanovitch  Vahrushin,  oh,  future\nmillionaire  Zeus  who  would  arrange  their  lives\nfor them? In another ten years? In another ten\nyears, mother will be blind with knitting shawls,\nmaybe with weeping too. She will be worn to a\nshadow with fasting; and my sister? Imagine for\na  moment  what  may  have  become  of  your  (cid:24)\nsister  in  ten  years?  What  may  happen  to  her\nduring those ten years? Can you fancy?'\nSo he tortured himself, fretting himself with such\nquestions, and finding a kind of enjoyment in it.\nAnd yet all these questions were not new ones\nsuddenly confronting him, they were old familiar\naches. It was long since they had first begun to", "grip  and  rend  his  heart.  Long,  long  ago  his\npresent  anguish  had  its  first  beginnings;  it  had\nwaxed  and  gathered  strength,  it  had  matured\nand concentrated, until it had taken the form of\na fearful, frenzied and fantastic question, which\ntortured  his  heart  and  mind,  clamouring\ninsistently  for  an  answer.  Now  his  mother's\nletter had burst on him like a thunderclap. It was\nclear  that  he  must  not  now  suffer  passively,\nworrying  himself  over  unsolved  questions,  but\nthat  he  must  do  something,  do  it  at  once,  and\ndo  it  quickly.  Anyway  he  must  decide  on\nsomething, or else ...\n'Or throw up life altogether!' he cried suddenly,\nin  a  frenzy-'accept  one's  lot  humbly  as  it  is,\nonce  for  all  and  stifle  everything  in  oneself,\ngiving up all claim to activity, life and love!'\n'Do  you  understand,  sir,  do  you  understand\nwhat  it  means  when  you  have  absolutely\nnowhere to turn?' Marmeladov's question came\nsuddenly  into  his  mind,  'for  every  man  must\nhave somewhere to turn....'\nHe  gave  a  sudden  start;  another  thought,  that\nhe  had  had  yesterday,  slipped  back  into  his", "mind.  But  he  did  not  start  at  the  thought\nrecurring  to  him,  for  he  knew,  he  had  felt\nbeforehand  that  it  must  come  back,  he  was\nexpecting it; besides it was not only yesterday's\nthought. The difference was that a (cid:24)0 Crime and\nPunishment  month  ago,  yesterday  even,  the\nthought  was  a  mere  dream:  but  now  ...  now  it\nappeared not a dream at all, it had taken a new\nmenacing  and  quite  unfamiliar  shape,  and  he\nsuddenly  became  aware  of  this  himself....  He\nfelt  a  hammering  in  his  head,  and  there  was  a\ndarkness before his eyes.\nHe looked round hurriedly, he was searching for\nsomething.  He  wanted  to  sit  down  and  was\nlooking for a seat; he was walking along the K--\nBoulevard.  There  was  a  seat  about  a  hundred\npaces  in  front  of  him.  He  walked  towards  it  as\nfast he could; but on the way he met with a little\nadventure  which  absorbed  all  his  attention.\nLooking  for  the  seat,  he  had  noticed  a  woman\nwalking some twenty paces in front of him, but\nat  first  he  took  no  more  notice  of  her  than  of\nother  objects  that  crossed  his  path.  It  had\nhappened to him many times going home not to\nnotice the road by which he was going, and he\nwas accustomed to walk like that. But there was", "at  first  sight  something  so  strange  about  the\nwoman  in  front  of  him,  that  gradually  his\nattention  was  riveted  upon  her,  at  first\nreluctantly and, as it were, resentfully, and then\nmore and more intently. He felt a sudden desire\nto  find  out  what  it  was  that  was  so  strange\nabout  the  woman.  In  the  first  place,  she\nappeared to be a girl quite young, and she was\nwalking  in  the  great  heat  bareheaded  and  with\nno parasol or gloves, waving her arms about in\nan  absurd  way.  She  had  on  a  dress  of  some\nlight  silky  material,  but  put  on  strangely  awry,\nnot  properly  hooked  up,  and  torn  open  at  the\ntop of the skirt, close to the waist: a great piece\nwas  rent  and  hanging  loose.  A  little  kerchief\nwas flung about her bare throat, but lay slanting\non one 1 side. The girl was walking unsteadily,\ntoo, stumbling and staggering from side to side.\nShe drew Raskolnikov's whole attention at last.\nHe  overtook  the  girl  at  the  seat,  but,  on\nreaching  it,  she  dropped  down  on  it,  in  the\ncorner; she let her head sink on the back of the\nseat and closed her eyes, apparently in extreme\nexhaustion.  Looking  at  her  closely,  he  saw  at\nonce  that  she  was  completely  drunk.  It  was  a\nstrange  and  shocking  sight.  He  could  hardly\nbelieve  that  he  was  not  mistaken.  He  saw", "before him the face of a quite young, fairhaired\ngirl-sixteen,  perhaps  not  more  than  fifteen,\nyears  old,  pretty  little  face,  but  flushed  and\nheavy looking and, as it were, swollen. The girl\nseemed  hardly  to  know  what  she  was  doing;\nshe  crossed  one  leg  over  the  other,  lifting  it\nindecorously,  and  showed  every  sign  of  being\nunconscious that she was in the street.\nRaskolnikov  did  not  sit  down,  but  he  felt\nunwilling  to  leave  her,  and  stood  facing  her  in\nperplexity.  This  boulevard  was  never  much\nfrequented;  and  now,  at  two  o'clock,  in  the\nstifling  heat,  it  was  quite  deserted.  And  yet  on\nthe  further  side  of  the  boulevard,  about  fifteen\npaces away, a gentleman was standing on the\nedge  of  the  pavement.  He,  too,  would\napparently  have  liked  to  approach  the  girl  with\nsome  object  of  his  own.  He,  too,  had  probably\nseen her in the distance and had followed her,\nbut  found  Raskolnikov  in  his  way.  He  looked\nangrily  at  him,  though  he  tried  to  escape  his\nnotice, and stood impatiently biding his time, till\nthe unwelcome man in rags should have moved\naway.  His  intentions  were  unmistakable.  The\ngentleman was a plump, thickly-set man, about\nthirty,  fashionably  dressed,  with  a  high  colour,", "red  lips  and  moustaches.  Raskolnikov  felt\nfurious;  he  had  a  sudden  longing  to  insult  this\nfat  dandy  in  some  way.  He  left  the  girl  for  a\nmoment and walked towards the gentleman.\n'Hey!  You  Svidrigaïlov!  What  do  you  want\nhere?'  he  shouted,  clenching  his  fists  and\nlaughing, spluttering with rage.\n'What  do  you  mean?'  the  gentleman  asked\nsternly, scowling in haughty astonishment.\n'Get away, that's what I mean.'\n'How dare you, you low fellow!'\nHe raised his cane. Raskolnikov rushed at him\nwith  his  fists,  without  reflecting  that  the  stout\ngentleman  was  a  match  for  two  men  like\nhimself. But at that instant someone seized him\nfrom  behind,  and  a  police  constable  stood\nbetween them.\n'That's  enough,  gentlemen,  no  fighting,  please,\nin a public place. What do you want? Who are\nyou?' he asked Raskolnikov sternly, noticing his\nrags.", "Raskolnikov  looked  at  him  intently.  He  had  a\nstraightforward,  sensible,  soldierly  face,  with\ngrey moustaches and whiskers.\n'You are just the man I want,' Raskolnikov cried,\ncatching  at  his  arm.  'I  am  a  student,\nRaskolnikov.... You may as well know that too,'\nhe  added,  addressing  the  gentleman,  'come\nalong, I have something to show you.'\nAnd taking the policeman by the hand he drew\nhim towards the seat.\n'Look here, hopelessly drunk, and she has just\ncome  down  the  boulevard.  There  is  no  telling\nwho and what she (cid:24) is, she does not look like a\nprofessional. It's more likely she has been given\ndrink  and  deceived  somewhere  ...  for  the  first\ntime ... you understand? and they've put her out\ninto  the  street  like  that.  Look  at  the  way  her\ndress  is  torn,  and  the  way  it  has  been  put  on:\nshe  has  been  dressed  by  somebody,  she  has\nnot  dressed  herself,  and  dressed  by\nunpractised  hands,  by  a  man's  hands;  that's\nevident.  And  now  look  there:  I  don't  know  that\ndandy with whom I was going to fight, I see him", "for  the  first  time,  but  he,  too,  has  seen  her  on\nthe road, just now, drunk, not knowing what she\nis doing, and now he is very eager to get hold of\nher, to get her away somewhere while she is in\nthis state ... that's certain, believe me, I am not\nwrong.  I  saw  him  myself  watching  her  and\nfollowing her, but I prevented him, and he is just\nwaiting for me to go away. Now he has walked\naway a little, and is standing still, pretending to\nmake a cigarette.... Think how can we keep her\nout  of  his  hands,  and  how  are  we  to  get  her\nhome?'\nThe  policeman  saw  it  all  in  a  flash.  The  stout\ngentleman  was  easy  to  understand,  he  turned\nto consider the girl. The policeman bent over to\nexamine her more closely, and his face worked\nwith genuine compassion.\n'Ah,  what  a  pity!'  he  said,  shaking  his\nhead-'why,  she  is  quite  a  child!  She  has  been\ndeceived,  you  can  see  that  at  once.  Listen,\nlady,'  he  began  addressing  her,  'where  do  you\nlive?'  The  girl  opened  her  weary  and\nsleepy-looking  eyes,  gazed  blankly  at  the\nspeaker and waved her hand.", "'Here,'  said  Raskolnikov  feeling  in  his  pocket\nand  finding  twenty  copecks,  'here,  call  a  cab\nand  tell  him  to  drive  her  to  her  address.  The\nonly thing is to find out her address!'\n'Missy,  missy!'  the  policeman  began  again,\ntaking the money. 'I'll fetch you a cab and take\nyou  home  myself.  Where  shall  I  take  you,  eh?\nWhere do you live?'\n'Go  away!  They  won't  let  me  alone,'  the  girl\nmuttered, and once more waved her hand.'Ach, \nach,  how  shocking!  It's  shameful,  missy,  it's \na  shame!'  He  shook  his  head  again,  shocked,\nsympathetic and indignant.\n'It's  a  difficult  job,'  the  policeman  said  to\nRaskolnikov,  and  as  he  did  so,  he  looked  him\nup  and  down  in  a  rapid  glance.  He,  too,  must\nhave  seemed  a  strange  figure  to  him:  dressed\nin rags and handing him money!\n'Did you meet her far from here?' he asked him.\n'I  tell  you  she  was  walking  in  front  of  me,\nstaggering, just here, in the boulevard. She only\njust reached the seat and sank down on it.'", "'Ah,  the  shameful  things  that  are  done  in  the\nworld  nowadays,  God  have  mercy  on  us!  An\ninnocent  creature  like  that,  drunk  already!  She\nhas been deceived, that's a sure thing. See how\nher dress has been torn too.... Ah, the vice one\nsees  nowadays!  And  as  likely  as  not  she\nbelongs  to  gentlefolk  too,  poor  ones  maybe....\nThere are many like that nowadays. She looks\nrefined, too, as though she were a lady,' and he\nbent over her once more.\nPerhaps he had daughters growing up like that,\n'looking like ladies and refined' with pretensions\nto gentility and smartness....\n'The  chief  thing  is,'  Raskolnikov  persisted,  'to\nkeep  her  (cid:24)  out  of  this  scoundrel's  hands!  Why\nshould he outrage her! It's as clear as day what\nhe is after; ah, the brute, he is not moving off!'\nRaskolnikov  spoke  aloud  and  pointed  to  him.\nThe  gentleman  heard  him,  and  seemed  about\nto fly into a rage again, but thought better of it,\nand  confined  himself  to  a  contemptuous  look.\nHe then walked slowly another ten paces away\nand again halted.", "'Keep  her  out  of  his  hands  we  can,'  said  the\nconstable  thoughtfully,  'if  only  she'd  tell  us\nwhere  to  take  her,  but  as  it  is....  Missy,  hey,\nmissy!' he bent over her once more.\nShe  opened  her  eyes  fully  all  of  a  sudden,\nlooked  at  him  intently,  as  though  realising\nsomething,  got  up  from  the  seat  and  walked\naway in the direction from which she had come.\n'Oh  shameful  wretches,  they  won't  let  me\nalone!'  she  said,  waving  her  hand  again.  She\nwalked  quickly,  though  staggering  as  before.\nThe  dandy  followed  her,  but  along  another\navenue, keeping his eye on her.\n'Don't be anxious, I won't let him have her,' the\npoliceman  said  resolutely,  and  he  set  off  after\nthem.\n'Ah, the vice one sees nowadays!' he repeated\naloud, sighing.\nAt  that  moment  something  seemed  to  sting\nRaskolnikov; in an instant a complete revulsion\nof feeling came over him.", "'Hey, here!' he shouted after the policeman.\nThe latter turned round.\n'Let them be! What is it to do with you? Let her\ngo!  Let  him  amuse  himself.'  He  pointed  at  the\ndandy, 'What is it to do with you?'\nThe  policeman  was  bewildered,  and  stared  at\nhim openeyed. Raskolnikov laughed.\n'Well!'    ejaculated    the    policeman,    with    a \ngesture    of  contempt,  and  he  walked  after  the\ndandy and the girl, probably taking Raskolnikov\nfor a madman or something even worse.\n'He  has  carried  off  my  twenty  copecks,'\nRaskolnikov murmured angrily when he was left\nalone.  'Well,  let  him  take  as  much  from  the\nother fellow to allow him to have the girl and so\nlet it end. And why did I want to interfere? Is it\nfor  me  to  help?  Have  I  any  right  to  help?  Let\nthem  devour  each  other  alive-what  is  to  me?\nHow  did  I  dare  to  give  him  twenty  copecks?\nWere they mine?'\nIn  spite  of  those  strange  words  he  felt  very", "wretched.  He  sat  down  on  the  deserted  seat.\nHis  thoughts  strayed  aimlessly....  He  found  it\nhard to fix his mind on anything at that moment.\nHe longed to forget himself altogether, to forget\neverything, and then to wake up and begin life\nanew....\n'Poor girl!' he said, looking at the empty corner\nwhere  she  had  sat-  'She  will  come  to  herself\nand  weep,  and  then  her  mother  will  find  out....\nShe will give her a beating, a horrible, shameful\nbeating  and  then  maybe,  turn  her  out  of\ndoors....  And  even  if  she  does  not,  the  Darya\nFrantsovnas  will  get  wind  of  it,  and  the  girl  will\nsoon be slipping out on the sly here and there.\nThen  there  will  be  the  hospital  directly  (that's\nalways  the  luck  of  those  girls  with  respectable\nmothers, who go wrong on the sly) and then ...\nagain the hospital ... drink ... the taverns ... and\nmore  hospital,  in  (cid:24)  two  or  three  years-a  wreck,\nand  her  life  over  at  eighteen  or  nineteen....\nHave not I seen cases like that? And how have\nthey been brought to it? Why, they've all come\nto  it  like  that.  Ugh!  But  what  does  it  matter?\nThat's  as  it  should  be,  they  tell  us.  A  certain\npercentage, they tell us, must every year go ...\nthat  way  ...  to  the  devil,  I  suppose,  so  that  the", "rest  may  remain  chaste,  and  not  be  interfered\nwith.  A  percentage!  What  splendid  words  they\nhave;  they  are  so  scientific,  so  consolatory....\nOnce  you've  said  'percentage'  there's  nothing\nmore to worry about. If we had any other word\n...  maybe  we  might  feel  more  uneasy....  But\nwhat if Dounia were one of the percentage! Of\nanother one if not that one?\n'But  where  am  I  going?'  he  thought  suddenly.\n'Strange, I came out for something. As soon as I\nhad read the letter I came out.... I was going to\nVassilyevsky Ostrov, to Razumihin. That's what\nit  was  ...  now  I  remember.  What  for,  though?\nAnd  what  put  the  idea  of  going  to  Razumihin\ninto my head just now? That's curious.'\nHe wondered at himself. Razumihin was one of\nhis  old  comrades  at  the  university.  It  was\nremarkable  that  Raskolnikov  had  hardly  any\nfriends  at  the  university;  he  kept  aloof  from\neveryone,  went  to  see  no  one,  and  did  not\nwelcome  anyone  who  came  to  see  him,  and\nindeed everyone soon gave him up. He took no\npart in the students' gatherings, amusements or\nconversations.  He  worked  with  great  intensity\nwithout  sparing  himself,  and  he  was  respected", "for this, but no one liked him. He was very poor,\nand  there  was  a  sort  of  haughty  pride  and\nreserve about him, as though he were keeping\nsomething  to  himself.  He  seemed  to  some  of\nhis  comrades  to  look  down  upon  them  all  as\nchildren,  as  though  he  were  superior  in\ndevelopment,  knowledge  and  convictions,  as\nthough their beliefs and interests were beneath\nhim.\nWith Razumihin he had got on, or, at least, he\nwas  more  unreserved  and  communicative  with\nhim.  Indeed  it  was  impossible  to  be  on  any\nother  terms  with  Razumihin.  He  was  an\nexceptionally good-humoured and candid youth,\ngood-natured  to  the  point  of  simplicity,  though\nboth depth and dignity lay concealed under that\nsimplicity.  The  better  of  his  comrades\nunderstood  this,  and  all  were  fond  of  him.  He\nwas  extremely  intelligent,  though  he  was\ncertainly rather a simpleton at times. He was of\nstriking  appearance-tall,  thin,  blackhaired  and\nalways  badly  shaved.  He  was  sometimes\nuproarious  and  was  reputed  to  be  of  great\nphysical  strength.  One  night,  when  out  in  a\nfestive  company,  he  had  with  one  blow  laid  a\ngigantic  policeman  on  his  back.  There  was  no", "limit to his drinking powers, but he could abstain\nfrom  drink  altogether;  he  sometimes  went  too\nfar in his pranks; but he could do without pranks\naltogether.  Another  thing  striking  about\nRazumihin,  no  failure  distressed  him,  and  it\nseemed  as  though  no  unfavourable\ncircumstances could crush him. He could lodge\nanywhere,  and  bear  the  extremes  of  cold  and\nhunger.  He  was  very  poor,  and  kept  himself\nentirely  on  what  he  could  earn  by  work  of  one\nsort or another. He knew of no end of resources\nby  which  to  earn  money.  He  spent  one  whole\nwinter  without  lighting  his  stove,  and  used  to\ndeclare that he liked it better, because one slept\nmore  soundly  in  the  cold.  For  the  present  he,\ntoo, (cid:24) had been obliged to give up the university,\nbut it was only for a time, and he was working\nwith all his might to save enough to return to his\nstudies again. Raskolnikov had not been to see\nhim for the last four months, and Razumihin did\nnot  even  know  his  address.  About  two  months\nbefore,  they  had  met  in  the  street,  but\nRaskolnikov had turned away and even crossed\nto the other side that he might not be observed.\nAnd though Razumihin noticed him, he passed\nhim  by,  as  he  did  not  want  to  annoy  him.(cid:24)0\nCrime and Punishment ", "#$#$Chapter 5#$#$\n'Of  course,  I've  been  meaning  lately  to  go  to\nRazumihin's  to  ask  for  work,  to  ask  him  to  get\nme  lessons  or  something  ...'  Raskolnikov\nthought,  'but  what  help  can  he  be  to  me  now?\nSuppose  he  gets  me  lessons,  suppose  he\nshares  his  last  farthing  with  me,  if  he  has  any\nfarthings,  so  that  I  could  get  some  boots  and\nmake myself tidy enough to give lessons ... hm\n... Well and what then? What shall I do with the\nfew coppers I earn? That's not what I want now.\nIt's really absurd for me to go to Razumihin....'\nThe  question  why  he  was  now  going  to\nRazumihin agitated him even more than he was\nhimself  aware;  he  kept  uneasily  seeking  for\nsome  sinister  significance  in  this  apparently\nordinary action.\n'Could I have expected to set it all straight and\nto  find  a  way  out  by  means  of  Razumihin\nalone?' he asked himself in perplexity.\nHe  pondered  and  rubbed  his  forehead,  and,", "strange to say, after long musing, suddenly, as\nif  it  were  spontaneously  and  by  chance,  a\nfantastic thought came into his head.\n'Hm  ...  to  Razumihin's,'  he  said  all  at  once,\ncalmly,  as  though  he  had  reached  a  final\ndetermination.  'I  shall  go  to  Razumihin's  of\ncourse,  but  ...  not  now.  I  shall  go  to  him  ...  on\nthe  next  day  after  It,  when  It  will  be  over  and\neverything  will  begin  afresh....'1  And  suddenly\nhe realised what he was thinking.\n'After It,' he shouted, jumping up from the seat,\n'but is It really going to happen? Is it possible it\nreally  will  happen?'  He  left  the  seat,  and  went\noff  almost  at  a  run;  he  meant  to  turn  back,\nhomewards,  but  the  thought  of  going  home\nsuddenly filled him with intense loathing; in that\nhole, in that awful little cupboard of his, all this\nhad  for  a  month  past  been  growing  up  in  him;\nand he walked on at random.\nHis  nervous  shudder  had  passed  into  a  fever\nthat made him feel shivering; in spite of the heat\nhe  felt  cold.  With  a  kind  of  effort  he  began\nalmost unconsciously, from some inner craving,\nto stare at all the objects before him, as though", "looking  for  something  to  distract  his  attention;\nbut  he  did  not  succeed,  and  kept  dropping\nevery moment into brooding. When with a start\nhe  lifted  his  head  again  and  looked  round,  he\nforgot  at  once  what  he  had  just  been  thinking\nabout  and  even  where  he  was  going.  In  this\nway  he  walked  right  across  Vassilyevsky\nOstrov,  came  out  on  to  the  Lesser  Neva,\ncrossed  the  bridge  and  turned  towards  the\nislands.  The  greenness  and  freshness  were  at\nfirst  restful  to  his  weary  eyes  after  the  dust  of\nthe  town  and  the  huge  houses  that  hemmed\nhim in and weighed upon him. Here there were\nno taverns, no stifling closeness, no stench. But\nsoon  these  new  pleasant  sensations  passed\ninto  morbid  irritability.  Sometimes  he  stood  still\nbefore a brightly painted summer villa standing\namong  green  foliage,  he  gazed  through  the\nfence,  he  saw  in  the  distance  smartly  dressed\nwomen  on  the  verandahs  and  balconies,  and\nchildren  running  in  the  gardens.  The  flowers\nespecially  caught  his  attention;  he  gazed  at\nthem longer than at anything. He was met, too,\nby luxurious carriages and by men and women\non  horseback;  he  watched  them  with  curious\neyes  and  forgot  about  them  before  they  had\nvanished from his sight. Once he stood still and", "counted  his  money;  he  found  he  had  thirty\ncopecks.  'Twenty  to  the  policeman,  three  to\nNastasya  for  the  letter,  so  I  must  have  given\nforty-seven  or  fifty  to  the  Marmeladovs\nyesterday,' he thought, reckoning it up for some\nunknown  reason,  but  he  soon  forgot  with  what\nobject  he  had  taken  the  money  out  of  his\npocket.  He  recalled  it  on  passing  an\neatinghouse  or  tavern,  and  felt  that  he  was\nhungry....  Going  into  the  tavern  he  drank  a\nglass  of  vodka  and  ate  a  pie  of  some  sort.  He\nfinished  eating  it  as  he  walked  away.  It  was  a\nlong while since he had taken vodka and it had\nan  effect  upon  him  at  once,  though  he  only\ndrank  a  wineglassful.  His  legs  felt  suddenly\nheavy and a great drowsiness came upon him.\nHe  turned  homewards,  but  reaching  Petrovsky\nOstrov  he  stopped  completely  exhausted,\nturned off the road into the bushes, sank down\nupon the grass and instantly fell asleep.\nIn a morbid condition of the brain, dreams often\nhave  a  singular  actuality,  vividness,  and\nextraordinary  semblance  of  reality.  At  times\nmonstrous  images  are  created,  but  the  setting\nand the whole picture are so truthlike and filled\nwith details so delicate, so unexpectedly, but so", "artistically consistent, that the dreamer, were he\nan  artist  like  Pushkin  or  Turgenev  even,  could\nnever  have  invented  them  in  the  waking  state.\nSuch  sick  dreams  always  remain  long  in  the\nmemory  and  make  a  powerful  impression  on\nthe  overwrought  and  deranged  nervous\nsystem.(cid:24)  Raskolnikov  had  a  fearful  dream.  He\ndreamt he was back in his childhood in the little\ntown  of  his  birth.  He  was  a  child  about  seven\nyears  old,  walking  into  the  country  with  his\nfather on the evening of a holiday. It was a grey\nand  heavy  day,  the  country  was  exactly  as  he\nremembered  it;  indeed  he  recalled  it  far  more\nvividly  in  his  dream  than  he  had  done  in\nmemory. The little town stood on a level flat as\nbare as the hand, not even a willow near it; only\nin the far distance, a copse lay, a dark blur on\nthe  very  edge  of  the  horizon.  A  few  paces\nbeyond the last market garden stood a tavern, a\nbig tavern, which had always aroused in him a\nfeeling  of  aversion,  even  of  fear,  when  he\nwalked by it with his father. There was always a\ncrowd  there,  always  shouting,  laughter  and\nabuse,  hideous  hoarse  singing  and  often\nfighting.  Drunken  and  horrible-looking  figures\nwere hanging about the tavern. He used to cling\nclose  to  his  father,  trembling  all  over  when  he", "met  them.  Near  the  tavern  the  road  became  a\ndusty track, the dust of which was always black.\nIt  was  a  winding  road,  and  about  a  hundred\npaces  further  on,  it  turned  to  the  right  to  the\ngraveyard. In the middle of the graveyard stood\na  stone  church  with  a  green  cupola  where  he\nused  to  go  to  mass  two  or  three  times  a  year\nwith his father and mother, when a service was\nheld  in  memory  of  his  grandmother,  who  had\nlong been dead, and whom he had never seen.\nOn  these  occasions  they  used  to  take  on  a\nwhite  dish  tied  up  in  a  table  napkin  a  special\nsort of rice pudding with raisins stuck in it in the\nshape  of  a  cross.  He  loved  that  church,  the\nold-fashioned,  unadorned  ikons  and  the  old\npriest  with  the  shaking  head.  Near  his\ngrandmoth  er's  grave,  which  was  marked  by  a\nstone, was the little grave of his younger brother\nwho  had  died  at  six  months  old.  He  did  not\nremember him at all, but he had been told about\nhis  little  brother,  and  whenever  he  visited  the\ngraveyard he used religiously and reverently to\ncross  himself  and  to  bow  down  and  kiss  the\nlittle  grave.  And  now  he  dreamt  that  he  was\nwalking  with  his  father  past  the  tavern  on  the\nway  to  the  graveyard;  he  was  holding  his\nfather's  hand  and  looking  with  dread  at  the", "tavern.  A  peculiar  circumstance  attracted  his\nattention:  there  seemed  to  be  some  kind  of\nfestivity  going  on,  there  were  crowds  of  gaily\ndressed  townspeople,  peasant  women,  their\nhusbands,  and  riff-raff  of  all  sorts,  all  singing\nand all more or less drunk. Near the entrance of\nthe  tavern  stood  a  cart,  but  a  strange  cart.  It\nwas  one  of  those  big  carts  usually  drawn  by\nheavy cart-horses and laden with casks of wine\nor  other  heavy  goods.  He  always  liked  looking\nat  those  great  cart-  horses,  with  their  long\nmanes, thick legs, and slow even pace, drawing\nalong a perfect mountain with no appearance of\neffort, as though it were easier going with a load\nthan  without  it.  But  now,  strange  to  say,  in  the\nshafts  of  such  a  cart  he  saw  a  thin  little  sorrel\nbeast,  one  of  those  peasants'  nags  which  he\nhad  often  seen  straining  their  utmost  under  a\nheavy load of wood or hay, especially when the\nwheels  were  stuck  in  the  mud  or  in  a  rut.  And\nthe  peasants  would  beat  them  so  cruelly,\nsometimes even about the nose and eyes, and\nhe felt so sorry, so sorry for them that he almost\ncried,  and  his  mother  always  used  to  take  him\naway  from  the  window.  All  of  a  sudden  there\nwas a great uproar of shouting, singing and the\nbalalaïka, and from the (cid:24) tavern a number of big", "and  very  drunken  peasants  came  out,  wearing\nred and blue shirts and coats thrown over their\nshoulders.\n'Get  in,  get  in!'  shouted  one  of  them,  a  young\nthicknecked peasant with a fleshy face red as a\ncarrot. 'I'll take you all, get in!'\nBut  at  once  there  was  an  outbreak  of  laughter\nand exclamations in the crowd.\n'Take us all with a beast like that!'\n'Why,  Mikolka,  are  you  crazy  to  put  a  nag  like\nthat in such a cart?'\n'And this mare is twenty if she is a day, mates!'\n'Get in, I'll take you all,' Mikolka shouted again,\nleaping  first  into  the  cart,  seizing  the  reins  and\nstanding straight up in front. 'The bay has gone\nwith Matvey,' he shouted from the cart-'and this\nbrute, mates, is just breaking my heart, I feel as\nif I could kill her. She's just eating her head off.\nGet  in,  I  tell  you!  I'll  make  her  gallop!  She'll\ngallop!'  and  he  picked  up  the  whip,  preparing\nhimself with relish to flog the little mare.", "'Get  in!  Come  along!'  The  crowd  laughed.\n'D'you hear, she'll gallop!'\n'Gallop indeed! She has not had a gallop in her\nfor the last ten years!'\n'She'll jog along!'\n'Don't  you  mind  her,  mates,  bring  a  whip  each\nof you, get ready!'\n'All right! Give it to her!'\nThey all clambered into Mikolka's cart, laughing\nand making jokes. Six men got in and there was\nstill  room  for  more.  They  hauled  in  a  fat,\nrosy-cheeked  woman.  She  was  dressed  in  red\ncotton,  in  a  pointed,  beaded  headdress  and\nthick leather shoes; she was cracking nuts and\nlaughing.  The  crowd  round  them  was  laughing\ntoo and indeed, how could they help laughing?\nThat wretched nag was to drag all the cartload\nof  them  at  a  gallop!  Two  young  fellows  in  the\ncart  were  just  getting  whips  ready  to  help\nMikolka. With the cry of 'now,' the mare tugged\nwith all her might, but far from galloping, could", "scarcely  move  forward;  she  struggled  with  her\nlegs,  gasping  and  shrinking  from  the  blows  of\nthe three whips which were showered upon her\nlike  hail.  The  laughter  in  the  cart  and  in  the\ncrowd  was  redoubled,  but  Mikolka  flew  into  a\nrage and furiously thrashed the mare, as though\nhe supposed she really could gallop.\n'Let  me  get  in,  too,  mates,'  shouted  a  young\nman in the crowd whose appetite was aroused.\n'Get  in,  all  get  in,'  cried  Mikolka,  'she  will  draw\nyou all. I'll beat her to death!' And he thrashed\nand  thrashed  at  the  mare,  beside  himself  with\nfury.\n'Father,  father,'  he  cried,  'father,  what  are  they\ndoing? Father, they are beating the poor horse!'\n'Come along, come along!' said his father. 'They\nare  drunken  and  foolish,  they  are  in  fun;  come\naway,  don't  look!'  and  he  tried  to  draw  him\naway,  but  he  tore  himself  away  from  his  hand,\nand,  beside  himself  with  horror,  ran  to  the\nhorse.  The  poor  beast  was  in  a  bad  way.  She\nwas  gasping,  standing  still,  then  tugging  again\nand almost falling.", "'Beat  her  to  death,'  cried  Mikolka,  'it's  come  to\nthat. I'll (cid:24) do for her!'\n'What  are  you  about,  are  you  a  Christian,  you\ndevil?' shouted an old man in the crowd.\n'Did anyone ever see the like? A wretched nag\nlike that pulling such a cartload,' said another.\n'You'll kill her,' shouted the third.\n'Don't  meddle!  It's  my  property,  I'll  do  what  I\nchoose. Get in, more of you! Get in, all of you! I\nwill have her go at a gallop! ...'\nAll  at  once  laughter  broke  into  a  roar  and\ncovered  everything:  the  mare,  roused  by  the\nshower of blows, began feebly kicking. Even the\nold  man  could  not  help  smiling.  To  think  of  a\nwretched little beast like that trying to kick!\nTwo  lads  in  the  crowd  snatched  up  whips  and\nran to the mare to beat her about the ribs. One\nran each side.\n'Hit  her  in  the  face,  in  the  eyes,  in  the  eyes,'", "cried Mikolka.\n'Give  us  a  song,  mates,'  shouted  someone  in\nthe  cart  and  everyone  in  the  cart  joined  in  a\nriotous  song,  jingling  a  tambourine  and\nwhistling.  The  woman  went  on  cracking  nuts\nand laughing.\n...  He  ran  beside  the  mare,  ran  in  front  of  her,\nsaw her being whipped across the eyes, right in\nthe  eyes!  He  was  crying,  he  felt  choking,  his\ntears were streaming. One of the men gave him\na cut with the whip across the face, he did not\nfeel  it.  Wringing  his  hands  and  screaming,  he\nrushed up to the grey-headed old man with the\ngrey  beard,  who  was  shaking  his  head  in\ndisapproval.  One  woman  seized  him  by  the\nhand  and  would  have  taken  him  away,  but  he\ntore him self from her and ran back to the mare.\nShe  was  almost  at  the  last  gasp,  but  began\nkicking once more.\n'I'll  teach  you  to  kick,'  Mikolka  shouted\nferociously.  He  threw  down  the  whip,  bent\nforward  and  picked  up  from  the  bottom  of  the\ncart a long, thick shaft, he took hold of one end\nwith both hands and with an effort brandished it", "over the mare.\n'He'll  crush  her,'  was  shouted  round  him.  'He'll\nkill her!'\n'It's  my  property,'  shouted  Mikolka  and  brought\nthe shaft down with a swinging blow. There was\na sound of a heavy thud.\n'Thrash  her,  thrash  her!  Why  have  you\nstopped?' shouted voices in the crowd.\nAnd Mikolka swung the shaft a second time and\nit fell a second time on the spine of the luckless\nmare.  She  sank  back  on  her  haunches,  but\nlurched forward and tugged forward with all her\nforce, tugged first on one side and then on the\nother, trying to move the cart. But the six whips\nwere  attacking  her  in  all  directions,  and  the\nshaft was raised again and fell upon her a third\ntime, then a fourth, with heavy measured blows.\nMikolka was in a fury that he could not kill her at\none blow.\n'She's a tough one,' was shouted in the crowd.\n'She'll fall in a minute, mates, there will soon be", "an end of her,' said an admiring spectator in the\ncrowd.\n'Fetch an axe to her! Finish her off,' shouted a\nthird.\n'I'll  show  you!  Stand  off,'  Mikolka  screamed\nfrantically;  he  threw  down  the  shaft,  stooped\ndown in the cart and picked up an iron crowbar.\n'Look  out,'  he  shouted,  and  with  (cid:24)  all  his  might\nhe dealt a stunning blow at the poor mare. The\nblow  fell;  the  mare  staggered,  sank  back,  tried\nto  pull,  but  the  bar  fell  again  with  a  swinging\nblow on her back and she fell on the ground like\na log.\n'Finish  her  off,'  shouted  Mikolka  and  he  leapt\nbeside  himself,  out  of  the  cart.  Several  young\nmen,  also  flushed  with  drink,  seized  anything\nthey  could  come  across-whips,  sticks,  poles,\nand  ran  to  the  dying  mare.  Mikolka  stood  on\none side and began dealing random blows with\nthe crowbar. The mare stretched out her head,\ndrew a long breath and died.\n'You  butchered  her,'  someone  shouted  in  the\ncrowd.", "'Why wouldn't she gallop then?'\n'My  property!'  shouted  Mikolka,  with  bloodshot\neyes,  brandishing  the  bar  in  his  hands.  He\nstood  as  though  regretting  that  he  had  nothing\nmore to beat.\n'No  mistake  about  it,  you  are  not  a  Christian,'\nmany voices were shouting in the crowd.\nBut the poor boy, beside himself, made his way,\nscreaming, through the crowd to the sorrel nag,\nput his arms round her bleeding dead head and\nkissed it, kissed the eyes and kissed the lips....\nThen he jumped up and flew in a frenzy with his\nlittle  fists  out  at  Mikolka.  At  that  instant  his\nfather,  who  had  been  running  after  him,\nsnatched  him  up  and  carried  him  out  of  the\ncrowd.\n'Come along, come! Let us go home,' he said to\nhim.\n'Father! Why did they ... kill ... the poor horse!'\nhe  sobbed,  but  his  voice  broke  and  the  words\ncame in shrieks from his panting chest.(cid:24)0 Crime", "and  Punishment  'They  are  drunk....  They  are\nbrutal  ...  it's  not  our  business!'  said  his  father.\nHe  put  his  arms  round  his  father  but  he  felt\nchoked,  choked.  He  tried  to  draw  a  breath,  to\ncry out-and woke up.\nHe  waked  up,  gasping  for  breath,  his  hair\nsoaked with perspiration, and stood up in terror.\n'Thank  God,  that  was  only  a  dream,'  he  said,\nsitting  down  under  a  tree  and  drawing  deep\nbreaths. 'But what is it? Is it some fever coming\non? Such a hideous dream!'\nHe  felt  utterly  broken:  darkness  and  confusion\nwere  in  his  soul.  He  rested  his  elbows  on  his\nknees and leaned his head on his hands.\n'Good God!' he cried, 'can it be, can it be, that I\nshall really take an axe, that I shall strike her on\nthe head, split her skull open ... that I shall tread\nin  the  sticky  warm  blood,  break  the  lock,  steal\nand  tremble;  hide,  all  spattered  in  the  blood  ...\nwith the axe.... Good God, can it be?'\nHe was shaking like a leaf as he said this.", "'But why am I going on like this?' he continued,\nsitting  up  again,  as  it  were  in  profound\namazement.  'I  knew  that  I  could  never  bring\nmyself  to  it,  so  what  have  I  been  torturing\nmyself for till now? Yesterday, yesterday, when\nI  went  to  make  that  ...  experiment  yesterday  I\nrealised completely that I could never bear to do\nit....  Why  am  I  going  over  it  again,  then?  Why\nam  I  hesitating?  As  I  came  down  the  stairs\nyesterday,  I  said  myself  that  it  was  base,\nloathsome,  vile,  vile  ...  the  very  thought  of  it\nmade me feel sick and filled me with horror.\n'No,  I  couldn't  do  it,  I  couldn't  do  it!  Granted,\ngranted  that  1  there  is  no  flaw  in  all  that\nreasoning,  that  all  that  I  have  concluded  this\nlast month is clear as day, true as arithmetic....\nMy  God!  Anyway  I  couldn't  bring  myself  to  it!  I\ncouldn't do it, I couldn't do it! Why, why then am\nI still ... ?'\nHe rose to his feet, looked round in wonder as\nthough surprised at finding himself in this place,\nand went towards the bridge. He was pale, his\neyes  glowed,  he  was  exhausted  in  every  limb,\nbut  he  seemed  suddenly  to  breathe  more\neasily. He felt he had cast off that fearful burden", "that had so long been weighing upon him, and\nall  at  once  there  was  a  sense  of  relief  and\npeace  in  his  soul.  'Lord,'  he  prayed,  'show  me\nmy  path-I  renounce  that  accursed  ...  dream  of\nmine.'\nCrossing  the  bridge,  he  gazed  quietly  and\ncalmly  at  the  Neva,  at  the  glowing  red  sun\nsetting  in  the  glowing  sky.  In  spite  of  his\nweakness  he  was  not  conscious  of  fatigue.  It\nwas  as  though  an  abscess  that  had  been\nforming  for  a  month  past  in  his  heart  had\nsuddenly  broken.  Freedom,  freedom!  He  was\nfree  from  that  spell,  that  sorcery,  that\nobsession!\nLater on, when he recalled that time and all that\nhappened to him during those days, minute by\nminute,  point  by  point,  he  was  superstitiously\nimpressed by one circumstance, which, though\nin itself not very exceptional, always seemed to\nhim  afterwards  the  predestined  turning-point  of\nhis fate. He could never understand and explain\nto himself why, when he was tired and worn out,\nwhen  it  would  have  been  more  convenient  for\nhim to go home by the shortest and most direct\nway, he had returned by the Hay Market where", "he  had  no  need  to  go.  It  was  obviously  and\nquite  unnecessarily  out  of  his  way,  though  not\nmuch  so.  It  is  true  that  it  happened  to  him\ndozens of times to return home without noticing\nwhat  streets  he  passed  through.  But  why,  he\nwas  always  asking  himself,  why  had  such  an\nimportant, such a decisive and at the same time\nsuch  an  absolutely  chance  meeting  happened\nin the Hay Market (where he had moreover no\nreason to go) at the very hour, the very minute\nof  his  life  when  he  was  just  in  the  very  mood\nand  in  the  very  circumstances  in  which  that\nmeeting was able to exert the gravest and most\ndecisive  influence  on  his  whole  destiny?  As\nthough  it  had  been  lying  in  wait  for  him  on\npurpose!\nIt was about nine o'clock when he crossed the\nHay  Market.  At  the  tables  and  the  barrows,  at\nthe booths and the shops, all the market people\nwere  closing  their  establishments  or  clearing\naway and packing up their wares and, like their\ncustomers, were going home. Rag pickers and\ncostermongers of all kinds were crowding round\nthe  taverns  in  the  dirty  and  stinking  courtyards\nof the Hay Market. Raskolnikov particularly liked\nthis place and the neighbouring alleys, when he", "wandered aimlessly in the streets. Here his rags\ndid not attract contemptuous attention, and one\ncould  walk  about  in  any  attire  without\nscandalising people. At the corner of an alley a\nhuckster  and  his  wife  had  two  tables  set  out\nwith  tapes,  thread,  cotton  handkerchiefs,  etc.\nThey,  too,  had  got  up  to  go  home,  but  were\nlingering in conversation with a friend, who had\njust come up to them. This friend was Lizaveta\nIvanovna, or, as everyone called her, Lizaveta,\nthe  younger  sister  of  the  old  pawnbroker,\nAlyona  Ivanovna,  whom  Raskolnikov  had\nvisited the previous day to pawn his watch and\nmake  his  experiment....  He  already  (cid:24)  knew  all\nabout  Lizaveta  and  she  knew  him  a  little  too.\nShe  was  a  single  woman  of  about  thirty-five,\ntall,  clumsy,  timid,  submissive  and  almost\nidiotic.  She  was  a  complete  slave  and  went  in\nfear and trembling of her sister, who made her\nwork  day  and  night,  and  even  beat  her.  She\nwas standing with a bundle before the huckster\nand his wife, listening earnestly and doubtfully.\nThey  were  talking  of  something  with  special\nwarmth. The moment Raskolnikov caught sight\nof her, he was overcome by a strange sensation\nas it were of intense astonishment, though there\nwas nothing astonishing about this meeting.", "'You  could  make  up  your  mind  for  yourself,\nLizaveta  Ivanovna,'  the  huckster  was  saying\naloud.  'Come  round  tomorrow  about  seven.\nThey will be here too.'\n'To-morrow?'  said  Lizaveta  slowly  and\nthoughtfully,  as  though  unable  to  make  up  her\nmind.\n'Upon  my  word,  what  a  fright  you  are  in  of\nAlyona Ivanovna,' gabbled the huckster's wife, a\nlively  little  woman.  'I  look  at  you,  you  are  like\nsome little babe. And she is not your own sister\neither-nothing but a step-sister and what a hand\nshe keeps over you!'\n'But  this  time  don't  say  a  word  to  Alyona\nIvanovna,'  her  husband  interrupted;  'that's  my\nadvice, but come round to us without asking. It\nwill  be  worth  your  while.  Later  on  your  sister\nherself may have a notion.'\n'Am I to come?'\n'About  seven  o'clock  to-morrow.  And  they  will\nbe here. You will be able to decide for yourself.'", "'And we'll have a cup of tea,' added his wife. 'All\nright,  I'll  come,'  said  Lizaveta,  still  pondering,\nand she began slowly moving away.\nRaskolnikov  had  just  passed  and  heard  no\nmore. He passed softly, unnoticed, trying not to\nmiss a word. His first amazement was followed\nby  a  thrill  of  horror,  like  a  shiver  running  down\nhis spine. He had learnt, he had suddenly quite\nunexpectedly learnt, that the next day at seven\no'clock  Lizaveta,  the  old  woman's  sister  and\nonly companion, would be away from home and\nthat therefore at seven o'clock precisely the old\nwoman would be left alone.\nHe  was  only  a  few  steps  from  his  lodging.  He\nwent  in  like  a  man  condemned  to  death.  He\nthought  of  nothing  and  was  incapable  of\nthinking; but he felt suddenly in his whole being\nthat he had no more freedom of thought, no will,\nand  that  everything  was  suddenly  and\nirrevocably decided.\nCertainly,  if  he  had  to  wait  whole  years  for  a\nsuitable  opportunity,  he  could  not  reckon  on  a\nmore  certain  step  towards  the  success  of  the", "plan than that which had just presented itself. In\nany case, it would have been difficult to find out\nbeforehand  and  with  certainty,  with  greater\nexactness and less risk, and without dangerous\ninquiries  and  investigations,  that  next  day  at  a\ncertain  time  an  old  woman,  on  whose  life  an\nattempt  was  contemplated,  would  be  at  home\nand entirely alone.(cid:24) ", "#$#$Chapter 6#$#$\nLater on Raskolnikov happened to find out why\nthe huckster and his wife had invited Lizaveta. It\nwas  a  very  ordinary  matter  and  there  was\nnothing  exceptional  about  it.  A  family  who  had\ncome to the town and been reduced to poverty\nwere selling their household goods and clothes,\nall  women's  things.  As  the  things  would  have\nfetched little in the market, they were looking for\na  dealer.  This  was  Lizaveta's  business.  She\nundertook  such  jobs  and  was  frequently\nemployed, as she was very honest and always\nfixed a fair price and stuck to it. She spoke as a\nrule little and, as we have said already, she was\nvery submissive and timid.\nBut  Raskolnikov  had  become  superstitious  of\nlate. The traces of superstition remained in him\nlong after, and were almost ineradicable. And in\nall  this  he  was  always  afterwards  disposed  to\nsee  something  strange  and  mysterious,  as  it\nwere, the presence of some peculiar influences\nand  coincidences.  In  the  previous  winter  a\nstudent  he  knew  called  Pokorev,  who  had  left", "for Harkov, had chanced in conversation to give\nhim  the  address  of  Alyona  Ivanovna,  the  old\npawnbroker,  in  case  he  might  want  to  pawn\nanything. For a long while he did not go to her,\nfor  he  had  lessons  and  managed  to  get  along\nsomehow.  Six  weeks  ago  he  had  remembered\nthe  address;  he  had  two  articles  that  could  be\npawned: his father's old silver watch and a little\ngold ring with three red stones, a present from\nhis sister at parting. He decided to take the ring.\nWhen  he  found  the  old  woman  he  had  felt  an\ninsurmountable  repulsion  for  her  at  the  first\nglance,  though  he  knew  nothing  special  about\nher. He got two roubles from her and went into\na  miserable  little  tavern  on  his  way  home.  He\nasked  for  tea,  sat  down  and  sank  into  deep\nthought. A strange idea was pecking at his brain\nlike  a  chicken  in  the  egg,  and  very,  very  much\nabsorbed him.\nAlmost  beside  him  at  the  next  table  there  was\nsitting  a  student,  whom  he  did  not  know  and\nhad  never  seen,  and  with  him  a  young  officer.\nThey had played a game of billiards and began\ndrinking  tea.  All  at  once  he  heard  the  student\nmention  to  the  officer  the  pawnbroker  Alyona\nIvanovna  and  give  him  her  address.  This  of", "itself  seemed  strange  to  Raskolnikov;  he  had\njust come from her and here at once he heard\nher  name.  Of  course  it  was  a  chance,  but  he\ncould  not  shake  off  a  very  extraordinary\nimpression,  and  here  someone  seemed  to  be\nspeaking  expressly  for  him;  the  student  began\ntelling  his  friend  various  details  about  Alyona\nIvanovna.\n'She  is  first-rate,'  he  said.  'You  can  always  get\nmoney  from  her.  She  is  as  rich  as  a  Jew,  she\ncan  give  you  five  thousand  roubles  at  a  time\nand  she  is  not  above  taking  a  pledge  for  a\nrouble.  Lots  of  our  fellows  have  had  dealings\nwith her. But she is an awful old harpy....'\nAnd  he  began  describing  how  spiteful  and\nuncertain she was, how if you were only a day\nlate with your interest the pledge was lost; how\nshe gave a quarter of the value of an article and\ntook five and even seven percent a month on it\nand  (cid:24)  so  on.  The  student  chattered  on,  saying\nthat  she  had  a  sister  Lizaveta,  whom  the\nwretched little creature was continually beating,\nand kept in complete bondage like a small child,\nthough Lizaveta was at least six feet high.", "'There's  a  phenomenon  for  you,'  cried  the\nstudent and he laughed.\nThey began talking about Lizaveta. The student\nspoke about her with a peculiar relish and was\ncontinually laughing and the officer listened with\ngreat interest and asked him to send Lizaveta to\ndo some mending for him. Raskolnikov did not\nmiss a word and learned everything about her.\nLizaveta was younger than the old woman and\nwas her half-sister, being the child of a different\nmother.  She  was  thirty-five.  She  worked  day\nand  night  for  her  sister,  and  besides  doing  the\ncooking  and  the  washing,  she  did  sewing  and\nworked as a charwoman and gave her sister all\nshe earned. She did not dare to accept an order\nor  job  of  any  kind  without  her  sister's\npermission.  The  old  woman  had  already  made\nher will, and Lizaveta knew of it, and by this will\nshe  would  not  get  a  farthing;  nothing  but  the\nmovables, chairs and so on; all the money was\nleft  to  a  monastery  in  the  province  of  N--,  that\nprayers  might  be  said  for  her  in  perpetuity.\nLizaveta  was  of  lower  rank  than  her  sister,\nunmarried  and  awfully  uncouth  in  appearance,\nremarkably  tall  with  long  feet  that  looked  as  if\nthey  were  bent  outwards.  She  always  wore", "battered  goatskin  shoes,  and  was  clean  in  her\nperson.  What  the  student  expressed  most\nsurprise  and  amusement  about  was  the  fact\nthat Lizaveta was continually with child. 'But you\nsay she is hideous?' observed the officer.\n'Yes,  she  is  so  dark-skinned  and  looks  like  a\nsoldier dressed up, but you know she is not at\nall hideous. She has such a good-natured face\nand  eyes.  Strikingly  so.  And  the  proof  of  it  is\nthat  lots  of  people  are  attracted  by  her.  She  is\nsuch  a  soft,  gentle  creature,  ready  to  put  up\nwith  anything,  always  willing,  willing  to  do\nanything. And her smile is really very sweet.'\n'You  seem  to  find  her  attractive  yourself,'\nlaughed the officer.\n'From  her  queerness.  No,  I'll  tell  you  what.  I\ncould kill that damned old woman and make off\nwith  her  money,  I  assure  you,  without  the\nfaintest  conscience-prick,'  the  student  added\nwith  warmth.  The  officer  laughed  again  while\nRaskolnikov shuddered. How strange it was!\n'Listen,  I  want  to  ask  you  a  serious  question,'\nthe  student  said  hotly.  'I  was  joking  of  course,", "but  look  here;  on  one  side  we  have  a  stupid,\nsenseless,  worthless,  spiteful,  ailing,  horrid  old\nwoman,  not  simply  useless  but  doing  actual\nmischief, who has not an idea what she is living\nfor  herself,  and  who  will  die  in  a  day  or  two  in\nany case. You understand? You understand?'\n'Yes,  yes,  I  understand,'  answered  the  officer,\nwatching his excited companion attentively.\n'Well, listen then. On the other side, fresh young\nlives  thrown  away  for  want  of  help  and  by\nthousands, on every side! A hundred thousand\ngood deeds could be done and helped, on that\nold  woman's  money  which  will  be  buried  in  a\nmonastery!  Hundreds,  thousands  perhaps,\nmight  be  set  (cid:24)  on  the  right  path;  dozens  of\nfamilies  saved  from  destitution,  from  ruin,  from\nvice,  from  the  Lock  hospitals-and  all  with  her\nmoney.  Kill  her,  take  her  money  and  with  the\nhelp  of  it  devote  oneself  to  the  service  of\nhumanity  and  the  good  of  all.  What  do  you\nthink, would not one tiny crime be wiped out by\nthousands  of  good  deeds?  For  one  life\nthousands would be saved from corruption and\ndecay.  One  death,  and  a  hundred  lives  in\nexchange-it's  simple  arithmetic!  Besides,  what", "value  has  the  life  of  that  sickly,  stupid,\nill-natured  old  woman  in  the  balance  of\nexistence! No more than the life of a louse, of a\nblack-beetle,  less  in  fact  because  the  old\nwoman  is  doing  harm.  She  is  wearing  out  the\nlives of others; the other day she bit Lizaveta's\nfinger  out  of  spite;  it  almost  had  to  be\namputated.'\n'Of  course  she  does  not  deserve  to  live,'\nremarked the officer, 'but there it is, it's nature.'\n'Oh,  well,  brother,  but  we  have  to  correct  and\ndirect nature, and, but for that, we should drown\nin  an  ocean  of  prejudice.  But  for  that,  there\nwould  never  have  been  a  single  great  man.\nThey talk of duty, conscience-I don't want to say\nanything against duty and conscience; -but the\npoint is, what do we mean by them. Stay, I have\nanother question to ask you. Listen!'\n'No,  you  stay,  I'll  ask  you  a  question.\nListen!''Well?'\n'You are talking and speechifying away, but tell\nme, would you kill the old woman yourself?'", "'Of course not! I was only arguing the justice of\nit.... It's nothing to do with me....'100 Crime and\nPunishment  'But  I  think,  if  you  would  not  do  it\nyourself,  there's  no  justice  about  it....  Let  us\nhave another game.'\nRaskolnikov was violently agitated. Of course, it\nwas all ordinary youthful talk and thought, such\nas he had often heard before in different forms\nand  on  different  themes.  But  why  had  he\nhappened  to  hear  such  a  discussion  and  such\nideas  at  the  very  moment  when  his  own  brain\nwas  just  conceiving  ...  the  very  same  ideas?\nAnd  why,  just  at  the  moment  when  he  had\nbrought  away  the  embryo  of  his  idea  from  the\nold  woman  had  he  dropped  at  once  upon  a\nconversation  about  her?  This  coincidence\nalways  seemed  strange  to  him.  This  trivial  talk\nin a tavern had an immense influence on him in\nhis later action; as though there had really been\nin  it  something  preordained,  some  guiding\nhint....\nOn  returning  from  the  Hay  Market  he  flung\nhimself  on  the  sofa  and  sat  for  a  whole  hour\nwithout  stirring.  Meanwhile  it  got  dark;  he  had\nno candle and, indeed, it did not occur to him to", "light  up.  He  could  never  recollect  whether  he\nhad  been  thinking  about  anything  at  that  time.\nAt last he was conscious of his former fever and\nshivering,  and  he  realised  with  relief  that  he\ncould lie down on the sofa. Soon heavy, leaden\nsleep came over him, as it were crushing him.\nHe  slept  an  extraordinarily  long  time  and\nwithout  dreaming.  Nastasya,  coming  into  his\nroom  at  ten  o'clock  the  next  morning,  had\ndifficulty in rousing him. She brought him in tea\nand bread. The tea was again the second brew\nand again in her own tea-pot.\n'My  goodness,  how  he  sleeps!'  she  cried\nindignantly.  'And  Free  eBooks  at  Planet\neBook.com 101 he is always asleep.'\nHe  got  up  with  an  effort.  His  head  ached,  he\nstood  up,  took  a  turn  in  his  garret  and  sank\nback on the sofa again.\n'Going to sleep again,' cried Nastasya. 'Are you\nill, eh?'\nHe made no reply.", "'Do you want some tea?'\n'Afterwards,'  he  said  with  an  effort,  closing  his\neyes again and turning to the wall.\nNastasya stood over him.\n'Perhaps  he  really  is  ill,'  she  said,  turned  and\nwent out. She came in again at two o'clock with\nsoup.  He  was  lying  as  before.  The  tea  stood\nuntouched.  Nastasya  felt  positively  offended\nand began wrathfully rousing him.\n'Why  are  you  lying  like  a  log?'  she  shouted,\nlooking at him with repulsion.\nHe got up, and sat down again, but said nothing\nand stared at the floor.\n'Are  you  ill  or  not?'  asked  Nastasya  and  again\nreceived  no  answer.  'You'd  better  go  out  and\nget a breath of air,' she said after a pause. 'Will\nyou eat it or not?'\n'Afterwards,' he said weakly.

Then he took the bread, took up a spoon\nand began to eat.\nHe  ate  a  little,  three  or  four  spoonfuls,  without\nappetite,  as  it  were  mechanically.  His  head\nached  less.  After  his  meal  10(cid:24)  Crime  and\nPunishment  he  stretched  himself  on  the  sofa\nagain,  but  now  he  could  not  sleep;  he  lay\nwithout  stirring,  with  his  face  in  the  pillow.  He\nwas  haunted  by  day-dreams  and  such  strange\nday-dreams;  in  one,  that  kept  recurring,  he\nfancied that he was in Africa, in Egypt, in some\nsort  of  oasis.  The  caravan  was  resting,  the\ncamels  were  peacefully  lying  down;  the  palms\nstood  all  around  in  a  complete  circle;  all  the\nparty were at dinner. But he was drinking water\nfrom  a  spring  which  flowed  gurgling  close  by.\nAnd it was so cool, it was wonderful, wonderful,\nblue,  cold  water  running  among  the\nparti-coloured  stones  and  over  the  clean  sand\nwhich  glistened  here  and  there  like  gold....", "Suddenly  he  heard  a  clock  strike.  He  started,\nroused  himself,  raised  his  head,  looked  out  of\nthe  window,  and  seeing  how  late  it  was,\nsuddenly  jumped  up  wide  awake  as  though\nsomeone had pulled him off the sofa. He crept\non  tiptoe  to  the  door,  stealthily  opened  it  and\nbegan listening on the staircase. His heart beat\nterribly.  But  all  was  quiet  on  the  stairs  as  if\neveryone  was  asleep....  It  seemed  to  him\nstrange and monstrous that he could have slept\nin such forgetfulness from the previous day and\nhad  done  nothing,  had  prepared  nothing  yet....\nAnd  meanwhile  perhaps  it  had  struck  six.  And\nhis  drowsiness  and  stupefaction  were  followed\nby  an  extraordinary,  feverish,  as  it  were\ndistracted  haste.  But  the  preparations  to  be\nmade  were  few.  He  concentrated  all  his\nenergies  on  thinking  of  everything  and\nforgetting  nothing;  and  his  heart  kept  beating\nand  thumping  so  that  he  could  hardly  breathe.\nFirst he had to make a noose and sew it into his\novercoat-a  work  of  a  moment.  He  rummaged\nunder his pillow and picked out Free eBooks at\nPlanet eBook.com 10(cid:24) amongst the linen stuffed\naway  under  it,  a  worn  out,  old  unwashed  shirt.\nFrom  its  rags  he  tore  a  long  strip,  a  couple  of\ninches wide and about sixteen inches long. He", "folded this strip in two, took off his wide, strong\nsummer overcoat of some stout cotton material\n(his only outer garment) and began sewing the\ntwo ends of the rag on the inside, under the left\narmhole. His hands shook as he sewed, but he\ndid  it  successfully  so  that  nothing  showed\noutside  when  he  put  the  coat  on  again.  The\nneedle and thread he had got ready long before\nand they lay on his table in a piece of paper. As\nfor the noose, it was a very ingenious device of\nhis own; the noose was intended for the axe. It\nwas impossible for him to carry the axe through\nthe street in his hands. And if hidden under his\ncoat  he  would  still  have  had  to  support  it  with\nhis  hand,  which  would  have  been  noticeable.\nNow he had only to put the head of the axe in\nthe  noose,  and  it  would  hang  quietly  under  his\narm  on  the  inside.  Putting  his  hand  in  his  coat\npocket, he could hold the end of the handle all\nthe way, so that it did not swing; and as the coat\nwas very full, a regular sack in fact, it could not\nbe  seen  from  outside  that  he  was  holding\nsomething with the hand that was in the pocket.\nThis  noose,  too,  he  had  designed  a  fortnight\nbefore.\nWhen  he  had  finished  with  this,  he  thrust  his", "hand into a little opening between his sofa and\nthe floor, fumbled in the left corner and drew out\nthe pledge which he had got ready long before\nand  hidden  there.  This  pledge  was,  however,\nonly a smoothly planed piece of wood the size\nand  thickness  of  a  silver  cigarette  case.  He\npicked  up  this  piece  of  wood  in  one  of  his\nwanderings  in  a  courtyard  where  there  10(cid:24)\nCrime  and  Punishment  was  some  sort  of  a\nworkshop.  Afterwards  he  had  added  to  the\nwood a thin smooth piece of iron, which he had\nalso  picked  up  at  the  same  time  in  the  street.\nPutting the iron which was a little the smaller on\nthe piece of wood, he fastened them very firmly,\ncrossing and re-crossing the thread round them;\nthen  wrapped  them  carefully  and  daintily  in\nclean white paper and tied up the parcel so that\nit would be very difficult to untie it. This was in\norder to divert the attention of the old woman for\na  time,  while  she  was  trying  to  undo  the  knot,\nand  so  to  gain  a  moment.  The  iron  strip  was\nadded to give weight, so that the woman might\nnot  guess  the  first  minute  that  the  'thing'  was\nmade of wood. All this had been stored by him\nbeforehand under the sofa. He had only just got\nthe  pledge  out  when  he  heard  someone\nsuddenly about in the yard.", "'It struck six long ago.'\n'Long ago! My God!'\nHe  rushed  to  the  door,  listened,  caught  up  his\nhat  and  began  to  descend  his  thirteen  steps\ncautiously,  noiselessly,  like  a  cat.  He  had  still\nthe  most  important  thing  to  do-to  steal  the  axe\nfrom  the  kitchen.  That  the  deed  must  be  done\nwith  an  axe  he  had  decided  long  ago.  He  had\nalso  a  pocket  pruning-knife,  but  he  could  not\nrely  on  the  knife  and  still  less  on  his  own\nstrength, and so resolved finally on the axe. We\nmay note in passing, one peculiarity in regard to\nall  the  final  resolutions  taken  by  him  in  the\nmatter; they had one strange characteristic: the\nmore final they were, the more hideous and the\nmore absurd they at once became in his eyes.\nIn spite of all his agonising inward struggle, he\nnever Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 10(cid:24) for\na single instant all that time could believe in the\ncarrying out of his plans.\nAnd,  indeed,  if  it  had  ever  happened  that\neverything  to  the  least  point  could  have  been\nconsidered  and  finally  settled,  and  no", "uncertainty of any kind had remained, he would,\nit  seems,  have  renounced  it  all  as  something\nabsurd, monstrous and impossible. But a whole\nmass  of  unsettled  points  and  uncertainties\nremained.  As  for  getting  the  axe,  that  trifling\nbusiness cost him no anxiety, for nothing could\nbe  easier.  Nastasya  was  continually  out  of  the\nhouse,  especially  in  the  evenings;  she  would\nrun  in  to  the  neighbours  or  to  a  shop,  and\nalways  left  the  door  ajar.  It  was  the  one  thing\nthe  landlady  was  always  scolding  her  about.\nAnd  so,  when  the  time  came,  he  would  only\nhave  to  go  quietly  into  the  kitchen  and  to  take\nthe  axe,  and  an  hour  later  (when  everything\nwas over) go in and put it back again. But these\nwere doubtful points. Supposing he returned an\nhour  later  to  put  it  back,  and  Nastasya  had\ncome  back  and  was  on  the  spot.  He  would  of\ncourse have to go by and wait till she went out\nagain. But supposing she were in the meantime\nto miss the axe, look for it, make an outcry -that\nwould  mean  suspicion  or  at  least  grounds  for\nsuspicion.\nBut those were all trifles which he had not even\nbegun to consider, and indeed he had no time.\nHe  was  thinking  of  the  chief  point,  and  put  off", "trifling details, until he could believe in it all. But\nthat seemed utterly unattainable. So it seemed\nto  himself  at  least.  He  could  not  imagine,  for\ninstance,  that  he  would  sometime  leave  off\nthinking, get up and simply go there.... Even his\nlate  experiment  (i.e.  his  vis10(cid:24)  Crime  and\nPunishment it with the object of a final survey of\nthe  place)  was  simply  an  attempt  at  an\nexperiment,  far  from  being  the  real  thing,  as\nthough one should say 'come, let us go and try\nit-why  dream  about  it!'-and  at  once  he  had\nbroken  down  and  had  run  away  cursing,  in  a\nfrenzy  with  himself.  Meanwhile  it  would  seem,\nas regards the moral question, that his analysis\nwas  complete;  his  casuistry  had  become  keen\nas  a  razor,  and  he  could  not  find  rational\nobjections  in  himself.  But  in  the  last  resort  he\nsimply  ceased  to  believe  in  himself,  and\ndoggedly,  slavishly  sought  arguments  in  all\ndirections,  fumbling  for  them,  as  though\nsomeone were forcing and drawing him to it.\nAt  first-long  before  indeed-he  had  been  much\noccupied  with  one  question;  why  almost  all\ncrimes  are  so  badly  concealed  and  so  easily\ndetected,  and  why  almost  all  criminals  leave\nsuch obvious traces? He had come gradually to", "many  different  and  curious  conclusions,  and  in\nhis opinion the chief reason lay not so much in\nthe  material  impossibility  of  concealing  the\ncrime,  as  in  the  criminal  himself.  Almost  every\ncriminal  is  subject  to  a  failure  of  will  and\nreasoning power by a childish and phenomenal\nheedlessness,  at  the  very  instant  when\nprudence and caution are most essential. It was\nhis  conviction  that  this  eclipse  of  reason  and\nfailure  of  will  power  attacked  a  man  like  a\ndisease,  developed  gradually  and  reached  its\nhighest point just before the perpetration of the\ncrime,  continued  with  equal  violence  at  the\nmoment  of  the  crime  and  for  longer  or  shorter\ntime after, according to the individual case, and\nthen  passed  off  like  any  other  disease.  The\nquestion  whether  the  disease  Free  eBooks  at\nPlanet eBook.com 10(cid:24) gives rise to the crime, or\nwhether the crime from its own peculiar nature\nis  always  accompanied  by  something  of  the\nnature  of  disease,  he  did  not  yet  feel  able  to\ndecide.\nWhen  he  reached  these  conclusions,  he\ndecided that in his own case there could not be\nsuch a morbid reaction, that his reason and will\nwould remain unimpaired at the time of carrying", "out  his  design,  for  the  simple  reason  that  his\ndesign was 'not a crime....' We will omit all the\nprocess  by  means  of  which  he  arrived  at  this\nlast  conclusion;  we  have  run  too  far  ahead\nalready....  We  may  add  only  that  the  practical,\npurely material difficulties of the affair occupied\na secondary position in his mind. 'One has but\nto keep all one's will-power and reason to deal\nwith them, and they will all be overcome at the\ntime  when  once  one  has  familiarised  oneself\nwith the minutest details of the business....' But\nthis preparation had never been begun. His final\ndecisions were what he came to trust least, and\nwhen the hour struck, it all came to pass quite\ndifferently,  as  it  were  accidentally  and\nunexpectedly.\nOne trifling circumstance upset his calculations,\nbefore he had even left the staircase. When he\nreached  the  landlady's  kitchen,  the  door  of\nwhich was open as usual, he glanced cautiously\nin  to  see  whether,  in  Nastasya's  absence,  the\nlandlady herself was there, or if not, whether the\ndoor  to  her  own  room  was  closed,  so  that  she\nmight not peep out when he went in for the axe.\nBut  what  was  his  amazement  when  he\nsuddenly  saw  that  Nastasya  was  not  only  at", "home  in  the  kitchen,  but  was  occupied  there,\ntaking linen out of a basket and hanging it on a\nline.  Seeing  him,  she  left  off  hanging  the\nclothes, turned to him and stared at him all the\n10(cid:24)  Crime  and  Punishment  time  he  was\npassing. He turned away his eyes, and walked\npast  as  though  he  noticed  nothing.  But  it  was\nthe  end  of  everything;  he  had  not  the  axe!  He\nwas overwhelmed.\n'What made me think,' he reflected, as he went\nunder  the  gateway,  'what  made  me  think  that\nshe  would  be  sure  not  to  be  at  home  at  that\nmoment!  Why,  why,  why  did  I  assume  this  so\ncertainly?'\nHe was crushed and even humiliated. He could\nhave  laughed  at  himself  in  his  anger....  A  dull\nanimal rage boiled within him.\nHe  stood  hesitating  in  the  gateway.  To  go  into\nthe  street,  to  go  a  walk  for  appearance'  sake\nwas  revolting;  to  go  back  to  his  room,  even\nmore revolting. 'And what a chance I have lost\nfor ever!' he muttered, standing aimlessly in the\ngateway,  just  opposite  the  porter's  little  dark\nroom,  which  was  also  open.  Suddenly  he", "started.  From  the  porter's  room,  two  paces\naway  from  him,  something  shining  under  the\nbench  to  the  right  caught  his  eye....  He  looked\nabout him-nobody. He approached the room on\ntiptoe, went down two steps into it and in a faint\nvoice  called  the  porter.  'Yes,  not  at  home!\nSomewhere  near  though,  in  the  yard,  for  the\ndoor is wide open.' He dashed to the axe (it was\nan axe) and pulled it out from under the bench,\nwhere  it  lay  between  two  chunks  of  wood;  at\nonce,  before  going  out,  he  made  it  fast  in  the\nnoose,  he  thrust  both  hands  into  his  pockets\nand  went  out  of  the  room;  no  one  had  noticed\nhim!  'When  reason  fails,  the  devil  helps!'  he\nthought with a strange grin. This chance raised\nhis spirits extraordinarily.\nHe  walked  along  quietly  and  sedately,  without\nhurry, to Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 10(cid:24)\navoid awakening suspicion. He scarcely looked\nat  the  passers-by,  tried  to  escape  looking  at\ntheir faces at all, and to be as little noticeable as\npossible. Suddenly he thought of his hat. 'Good\nheavens!  I  had  the  money  the  day  before\nyesterday  and  did  not  get  a  cap  to  wear\ninstead!'  A  curse  rose  from  the  bottom  of  his\nsoul.", "Glancing  out  of  the  corner  of  his  eye  into  a\nshop, he saw by a clock on the wall that it was\nten minutes past seven. He had to make haste\nand at the same time to go someway round, so\nas to approach the house from the other side....\nWhen  he  had  happened  to  imagine  all  this\nbeforehand, he had sometimes thought that he\nwould be very much afraid. But he was not very\nmuch  afraid  now,  was  not  afraid  at  all,  indeed.\nHis  mind  was  even  occupied  by  irrelevant\nmatters, but by nothing for long. As he passed\nthe  Yusupov  garden,  he  was  deeply  absorbed\nin  considering  the  building  of  great  fountains,\nand of their refreshing effect on the atmosphere\nin all the squares. By degrees he passed to the\nconviction  that  if  the  summer  garden  were\nextended  to  the  field  of  Mars,  and  perhaps\njoined to the garden of the Mihailovsky Palace,\nit would be a splendid thing and a great benefit\nto  the  town.  Then  he  was  interested  by  the\nquestion  why  in  all  great  towns  men  are  not\nsimply driven by necessity, but in some peculiar\nway  inclined  to  live  in  those  parts  of  the  town\nwhere  there  are  no  gardens  nor  fountains;\nwhere there is most dirt and smell and all sorts", "of  nastiness.  Then  his  own  walks  through  the\nHay  Market  came  back  to  his  mind,  and  for  a\nmoment  he  waked  up  to  reality.  'What\nnonsense!' he thought, 'better think of nothing at\nall!'110  Crime  and  Punishment  'So  probably\nmen  led  to  execution  clutch  mentally  at  every\nobject  that  meets  them  on  the  way,'  flashed\nthrough  his  mind,  but  simply  flashed,  like\nlightning;  he  made  haste  to  dismiss  this\nthought....  And  by  now  he  was  near;  here  was\nthe house, here was the gate. Suddenly a clock\nsomewhere  struck  once.  'What!  can  it  be\nhalf-past seven? Impossible, it must be fast!'\nLuckily  for  him,  everything  went  well  again  at\nthe  gates.  At  that  very  moment,  as  though\nexpressly for his benefit, a huge waggon of hay\nhad  just  driven  in  at  the  gate,  completely\nscreening him as he passed under the gateway,\nand the waggon had scarcely had time to drive\nthrough into the yard, before he had slipped in a\nflash  to  the  right.  On  the  other  side  of  the\nwaggon he could hear shouting and quarrelling;\nbut  no  one  noticed  him  and  no  one  met  him.\nMany  windows  looking  into  that  huge\nquadrangular  yard  were  open  at  that  moment,\nbut  he  did  not  raise  his  head-he  had  not  the", "strength  to.  The  staircase  leading  to  the  old\nwoman's room was close by, just on the right of\nthe gateway. He was already on the stairs....\nDrawing a breath, pressing his hand against his\nthrobbing  heart,  and  once  more  feeling  for  the\naxe and setting it straight, he began softly and\ncautiously  ascending  the  stairs,  listening  every\nminute. But the stairs, too, were quite deserted;\nall the doors were shut; he met no one. One flat\nindeed  on  the  first  floor  was  wide  open  and\npainters  were  at  work  in  it,  but  they  did  not\nglance  at  him.  He  stood  still,  thought  a  minute\nand  went  on.

For one instant\nthe thought floated through his mind 'Shall I go\nback?'  But  he  made  no  answer  and  began\nlistening  at  the  old  woman's  door,  a  dead\nsilence.

On the contrary,\nas  though  to  spite  him,  it  throbbed  more  and\nmore  violently.  He  could  stand  it  no  longer,  he\nslowly put out his hand to the bell and rang.

Seeing  this  she  did  not  pull  the  door\nback, but she did not let go the handle so that\nhe  almost  dragged  her  out  with  it  on  to  the\nstairs.  Seeing  that  she  was  standing  in  the\ndoorway not allowing him to pass, he advanced\nstraight  upon  her.  She  stepped  back  in  alarm,\ntried  to  say  something,  but  seemed  unable  to\nspeak and stared with open eyes at him.\n'Good  evening,  Alyona  Ivanovna,'  he  began,\ntrying  to  speak  easily,  but  his  voice  would  not", "obey him, it broke and shook.

Her\neyes seemed to be starting out of their sockets,", "the  brow  and  the  whole  face  were  drawn  and\ncontorted convulsively.\nHe  laid  the  axe  on  the  ground  near  the  dead\nbody  and  felt  at  once  in  her  pocket  (trying  to\navoid the streaming body)-the same right-hand\npocket from which she had taken the key on his\nlast  visit.  He  was  in  full  possession  of  his\nfaculties,  free  from  confusion  or  giddiness,  but\nhis hands were still trembling. He remembered\nafterwards  that  he  had  been  particularly\ncollected  and  careful,  trying  all  the  time  not  to\nget  smeared  with  blood....  He  pulled  out  the\nkeys  at  once,  they  were  all,  as  before,  in  one\nbunch  on  a  steel  ring.  He  ran  at  once  into  the\nbedroom  with  them.  It  was  a  very  small  room\nwith a whole shrine of holy images. Against the\nother  wall  stood  a  big  bed,  very  clean  and\ncovered  with  a  silk  patchwork  wadded  quilt.\nAgainst  a  third  wall  was  a  chest  of  drawers.\nStrange to say, so soon as he began to fit the\nkeys  into  the  chest,  so  soon  as  he  heard  their\njingling, a convulsive shudder passed over him.\nHe suddenly felt tempted again to give it all up\nand go away. But that was only for an instant; it\nwas too late to go back. He positively smiled at\nhimself,  when  suddenly  another  terrifying  idea", "occurred to his mind. He suddenly fancied that\nthe  old  woman  might  be  still  alive  and  might\nrecover  her  Free  eBooks  at  Planet  eBook.com\n11(cid:24)  senses.  Leaving  the  keys  in  the  chest,  he\nran back to the body, snatched up the axe and\nlifted it once more over the old woman, but did\nnot bring it down. There was no doubt that she\nwas  dead.  Bending  down  and  examining  her\nagain more closely, he saw clearly that the skull\nwas  broken  and  even  battered  in  on  one  side.\nHe was about to feel it with his finger, but drew\nback his hand and indeed it was evident without\nthat.  Meanwhile  there  was  a  perfect  pool  of\nblood.  All  at  once  he  noticed  a  string  on  her\nneck; he tugged at it, but the string was strong\nand  did  not  snap  and  besides,  it  was  soaked\nwith blood. He tried to pull it out from the front of\nthe dress, but something held it and prevented\nits coming. In his impatience he raised the axe\nagain to cut the string from above on the body,\nbut  did  not  dare,  and  with  difficulty,  smearing\nhis  hand  and  the  axe  in  the  blood,  after  two\nminutes'  hurried  effort,  he  cut  the  string  and\ntook  it  off  without  touching  the  body  with  the\naxe;  he  was  not  mistaken-it  was  a  purse.  On\nthe  string  were  two  crosses,  one  of  Cyprus\nwood and one of copper, and an image in silver", "filigree,  and  with  them  a  small  greasy  chamois\nleather  purse  with  a  steel  rim  and  ring.  The\npurse was stuffed very full; Raskolnikov thrust it\nin  his  pocket  without  looking  at  it,  flung  the\ncrosses  on  the  old  woman's  body  and  rushed\nback into the bedroom, this time taking the axe\nwith him.\nHe was in terrible haste, he snatched the keys,\nand  began  trying  them  again.  But  he  was\nunsuccessful. They would not fit in the locks. It\nwas not so much that his hands were shaking,\nbut  that  he  kept  making  mistakes;  though  he\nsaw  for  instance  that  a  key  was  not  the  right\none  and  would  not  11(cid:24)  Crime  and  Punishment\nfit,  still  he  tried  to  put  it  in.  Suddenly  he\nremembered and realised that the big key with\nthe deep notches, which was hanging there with\nthe small keys could not possibly belong to the\nchest of drawers (on his last visit this had struck\nhim),  but  to  some  strong  box,  and  that\neverything perhaps was hidden in that box. He\nleft the chest of drawers, and at once felt under\nthe  bedstead,  knowing  that  old  women  usually\nkeep  boxes  under  their  beds.  And  so  it  was;\nthere  was  a  good-sized  box  under  the  bed,  at\nleast  a  yard  in  length,  with  an  arched  lid", "covered with red leather and studded with steel\nnails.  The  notched  key  fitted  at  once  and\nunlocked it. At the top, under a white sheet, was\na coat of red brocade lined with hareskin; under\nit was a silk dress, then a shawl and it seemed\nas though there was nothing below but clothes.\nThe  first  thing  he  did  was  to  wipe  his  blood-\nstained hands on the red brocade. 'It's red, and\non red blood will be less noticeable,' the thought\npassed  through  his  mind;  then  he  suddenly\ncame to himself. 'Good God, am I going out of\nmy senses?' he thought with terror.\nBut  no  sooner  did  he  touch  the  clothes  than  a\ngold watch slipped from under the fur coat. He\nmade haste to turn them all over. There turned\nout  to  be  various  articles  made  of  gold  among\nthe  clothes-probably  all  pledges,  unredeemed\nor  waiting  to  be  redeemed-bracelets,  chains,\near-rings,  pins  and  such  things.  Some  were  in\ncases,  others  simply  wrapped  in  newspaper,\ncarefully and exactly folded, and tied round with\ntape. Without any delay, he began filling up the\npockets  of  his  trousers  and  overcoat  without\nexamining  or  undoing  the  parcels  and  cases;\nbut  he  had  not  Free  eBooks  at  Planet\neBook.com 11(cid:24) time to take many....", "He suddenly heard steps in the room where the\nold  woman  lay.  He  stopped  short  and  was  still\nas  death.  But  all  was  quiet,  so  it  must  have\nbeen his fancy. All at once he heard distinctly a\nfaint cry, as though someone had uttered a low\nbroken  moan.  Then  again  dead  silence  for  a\nminute or two. He sat squatting on his heels by\nthe box and waited holding his breath. Suddenly\nhe jumped up, seized the axe and ran out of the\nbedroom.\nIn the middle of the room stood Lizaveta with a\nbig  bundle  in  her  arms.  She  was  gazing  in\nstupefaction at her murdered sister, white as a\nsheet  and  seeming  not  to  have  the  strength  to\ncry out. Seeing him run out of the bedroom, she\nbegan  faintly  quivering  all  over,  like  a  leaf,  a\nshudder ran down her face; she lifted her hand,\nopened her mouth, but still did not scream. She\nbegan  slowly  backing  away  from  him  into  the\ncorner,  staring  intently,  persistently  at  him,  but\nstill uttered no sound, as though she could not\nget breath to scream. He rushed at her with the\naxe; her mouth twitched piteously, as one sees\nbabies'  mouths,  when  they  begin  to  be\nfrightened, stare intently at what frightens them", "and  are  on  the  point  of  screaming.  And  this\nhapless  Lizaveta  was  so  simple  and  had  been\nso thoroughly crushed and scared that she did\nnot even raise a hand to guard her face, though\nthat was the most necessary and natural action\nat the moment, for the axe was raised over her\nface.  She  only  put  up  her  empty  left  hand,  but\nnot to her face, slowly holding it out before her\nas though motioning him away. The axe fell with\nthe sharp edge just on the skull and split at one\n1(cid:24)0  Crime  and  Punishment  blow  all  the  top  of\nthe head. She fell heavily at once. Raskolnikov\ncompletely  lost  his  head,  snatching  up  her\nbundle, dropped it again and ran into the entry.\nFear gained more and more mastery over him,\nespecially  after  this  second,  quite  unexpected\nmurder.  He  longed  to  run  away  from  the  place\nas  fast  as  possible.  And  if  at  that  moment  he\nhad  been  capable  of  seeing  and  reasoning\nmore correctly, if he had been able to realise all\nthe difficulties of his position, the hopelessness,\nthe  hideousness  and  the  absurdity  of  it,  if  he\ncould  have  understood  how  many  obstacles\nand,  perhaps,  crimes  he  had  still  to  overcome\nor  to  commit,  to  get  out  of  that  place  and  to\nmake his way home, it is very possible that he", "would  have  flung  up  everything,  and  would\nhave gone to give himself up, and not from fear,\nbut from simple horror and loathing of what he\nhad  done.  The  feeling  of  loathing  especially\nsurged  up  within  him  and  grew  stronger  every\nminute. He would not now have gone to the box\nor even into the room for anything in the world.\nBut a sort of blankness, even dreaminess, had\nbegun by degrees to take possession of him; at\nmoments  he  forgot  himself,  or  rather,  forgot\nwhat  was  of  importance,  and  caught  at  trifles.\nGlancing, however, into the kitchen and seeing\na  bucket  half  full  of  water  on  a  bench,  he\nbethought  him  of  washing  his  hands  and  the\naxe.  His  hands  were  sticky  with  blood.  He\ndropped  the  axe  with  the  blade  in  the  water,\nsnatched  a  piece  of  soap  that  lay  in  a  broken\nsaucer  on  the  window,  and  began  washing  his\nhands in the bucket. When they were clean, he\ntook out the axe, washed the blade and spent a\nlong  time,  about  three  minutes,  washing  the\nwood  Free  eBooks  at  Planet  eBook.com  1(cid:24)1\nwhere  there  were  spots  of  blood  rubbing  them\nwith soap. Then he wiped it all with some linen\nthat was hanging to dry on a line in the kitchen\nand  then  he  was  a  long  while  attentively", "examining the axe at the window. There was no\ntrace left on it, only the wood was still damp. He\ncarefully  hung  the  axe  in  the  noose  under  his\ncoat.  Then  as  far  as  was  possible,  in  the  dim\nlight in the kitchen, he looked over his overcoat,\nhis  trousers  and  his  boots.  At  the  first  glance\nthere  seemed  to  be  nothing  but  stains  on  the\nboots. He wetted the rag and rubbed the boots.\nBut he knew he was not looking thoroughly, that\nthere  might  be  something  quite  noticeable  that\nhe  was  overlooking.  He  stood  in  the  middle  of\nthe room, lost in thought. Dark agonising ideas\nrose in his mind-the idea that he was mad and\nthat  at  that  moment  he  was  incapable  of\nreasoning,  of  protecting  himself,  that  he  ought\nperhaps to be doing something utterly different\nfrom  what  he  was  now  doing.  'Good  God!'  he\nmuttered 'I must fly, fly,' and he rushed into the\nentry.  But  here  a  shock  of  terror  awaited  him\nsuch as he had never known before.\nHe  stood  and  gazed  and  could  not  believe  his\neyes: the door, the outer door from the stairs, at\nwhich he had not long before waited and rung,\nwas standing unfastened and at least six inches\nopen. No lock, no bolt, all the time, all that time!\nThe  old  woman  had  not  shut  it  after  him", "perhaps as a precaution. But, good God! Why,\nhe  had  seen  Lizaveta  afterwards!  And  how\ncould  he,  how  could  he  have  failed  to  reflect\nthat  she  must  have  come  in  somehow!  She\ncould not have come through the wall!\nHe dashed to the door and fastened the latch.1\n'But no, the wrong thing again! I must get away,\nget away....'\nHe  unfastened  the  latch,  opened  the  door  and\nbegan listening on the staircase.\nHe listened a long time. Somewhere far away, it\nmight be in the gateway, two voices were loudly\nand  shrilly  shouting,  quarrelling  and  scolding.\n'What  are  they  about?'  He  waited  patiently.  At\nlast all was still, as though suddenly cut off; they\nhad separated. He was meaning to go out, but\nsuddenly, on the floor below, a door was noisily\nopened  and  someone  began  going  downstairs\nhumming a tune. 'How is it they all make such a\nnoise?' flashed through his mind. Once more he\nclosed the door and waited. At last all was still,\nnot  a  soul  stirring.  He  was  just  taking  a  step\ntowards  the  stairs  when  he  heard  fresh\nfootsteps.", "The  steps  sounded  very  far  off,  at  the  very\nbottom  of  the  stairs,  but  he  remembered  quite\nclearly and distinctly that from the first sound he\nbegan for some reason to suspect that this was\nsomeone coming there to the fourth floor, to the\nold  woman.  Why?  Were  the  sounds  somehow\npeculiar,  significant?  The  steps  were  heavy,\neven  and  unhurried.  Now  he  had  passed  the\nfirst  floor,  now  he  was  mounting  higher,  it  was\ngrowing more and more distinct! He could hear\nhis  heavy  breathing.  And  now  the  third  storey\nhad been reached. Coming here! And it seemed\nto him all at once that he was turned to stone,\nthat  it  was  like  a  dream  in  which  one  is  being\npursued, nearly caught and will be killed, and is\nrooted to the spot and cannot even move one's\narms.\nAt last when the unknown was mounting to the\nfourth  Free  eBooks  at  Planet  eBook.com  1(cid:24)(cid:24)\nfloor,  he  suddenly  started,  and  succeeded  in\nslipping neatly and quickly back into the flat and\nclosing  the  door  behind  him.  Then  he  took  the\nhook and softly, noiselessly, fixed it in the catch.\nInstinct helped him. When he had done this, he\ncrouched  holding  his  breath,  by  the  door.  The", "unknown  visitor  was  by  now  also  at  the  door.\nThey were now standing opposite one another,\nas he had just before been standing with the old\nwoman,  when  the  door  divided  them  and  he\nwas listening.\nThe visitor panted several times. 'He must be a\nbig,  fat  man,'  thought  Raskolnikov,  squeezing\nthe  axe  in  his  hand.  It  seemed  like  a  dream\nindeed.  The  visitor  took  hold  of  the  bell  and\nrang it loudly.\nAs  soon  as  the  tin  bell  tinkled,  Raskolnikov\nseemed to be aware of something moving in the\nroom.  For  some  seconds  he  listened  quite\nseriously. The unknown rang again, waited and\nsuddenly tugged violently and impatiently at the\nhandle of the door. Raskolnikov gazed in horror\nat the hook shaking in its fastening, and in blank\nterror expected every minute that the fastening\nwould  be  pulled  out.  It  certainly  did  seem\npossible, so violently was he shaking it. He was\ntempted  to  hold  the  fastening,  but  he  might  be\naware of it. A giddiness came over him again. 'I\nshall  fall  down!'  flashed  through  his  mind,  but\nthe unknown began to speak and he recovered\nhimself at once.", "'What's  up?  Are  they  asleep  or  murdered?\nD-damn them!' he bawled in a thick voice, 'Hey,\nAlyona Ivanovna, old witch! Lizaveta Ivanovna,\nhey, my beauty! open the door! Oh, damn them!\nAre they asleep or what?'1 And again, enraged,\nhe  tugged  with  all  his  might  a  dozen  times  at\nthe bell. He must certainly be a man of authority\nand an intimate acquaintance.\nAt  this  moment  light  hurried  steps  were  heard\nnot  far  off,  on  the  stairs.  someone  else  was\napproaching.  Raskolnikov  had  not  heard  them\nat first.\n'You  don't  say  there's  no  one  at  home,'  the\nnew-comer  cried  in  a  cheerful,  ringing  voice,\naddressing  the  first  visitor,  who  still  went  on\npulling the bell. 'Good evening, Koch.'\n'From  his  voice  he  must  be  quite  young,'\nthought Raskolnikov.\n'Who  the  devil  can  tell?  I've  almost  broken  the\nlock,' answered Koch. 'But how do you come to\nknow me?", "'Why! The day before yesterday I beat you three\ntimes running at billiards at Gambrinus'.''Oh!'\n'So  they  are  not  at  home?  That's  queer.

'Do  you\nsee how the door shakes if you pull it?''Well?'\n'That  shows  it's  not  locked,  but  fastened  with\nthe  hook!  Do  you  hear  how  the  hook\nclanks?''Well?'\n'Why,  don't  you  see?

While  they  were  knocking  and  talking\ntogether, the idea several times occurred to him\nto end it all at once and shout to them through\nthe  door.

Abruptly, without any\nthought at all, he went out, closing the door as\nthoroughly as he could, and went downstairs.\nHe  had  gone  down  three  flights  when  he\nsuddenly heard a loud voice below-where could\nhe go! There was nowhere to hide. He was just\ngoing back to the flat.\n'Hey there!

But  at  the\nsame instant several men talking loud and fast\nbegan  noisily  mounting  the  stairs.  There  were\nthree  or  four  of  them.  He  distinguished  the\nringing voice of the young man. 'They!'", "Filled  with  despair  he  went  straight  to  meet\nthem, feeling 'come what must!' If they stopped\nhim-all was lost; if they let him pass-all was lost\ntoo;  they  would  remember  him.  They  were\napproaching;  they  were  only  a  flight  from\nhim-and suddenly deliverance! A few steps from\nhim  on  the  right,  there  was  an  empty  flat  with\nthe door wide open, the flat on the second floor\nwhere  the  painters  had  been  at  work,  and\nwhich,  as  though  for  his  benefit,  they  had  just\nleft.  It  was  they,  no  doubt,  who  had  just  run\ndown, shouting. 1 The floor had only just been\npainted,  in  the  middle  of  the  room  stood  a  pail\nand a broken pot with paint and brushes. In one\ninstant he had whisked in at the open door and\nhidden  behind  the  wall  and  only  in  the  nick  of\ntime;  they  had  already  reached  the  landing.\nThen they turned and went on up to the fourth\nfloor,  talking  loudly.

'Should  he  slip  through\nsome  gateway  and  wait  somewhere  in  an\nunknown street? No, hopeless! Should he fling\naway  the  axe?  Should  he  take  a  cab?\nHopeless, hopeless!'\nAt last he reached the turning. He turned down\nit  more  dead  than  alive.  Here  he  was  half  way\nto safety, and he understood it; it was less risky\nbecause  there  was  a  great  crowd  of  people,\nand he was lost in it like a grain of sand.

He\nremembered however, that on coming out on to\nthe  canal  bank,  he  was  alarmed  at  finding  few\npeople  there  and  so  being  more  conspicuous,\nand he had thought of turning back. Though he\nwas almost falling from fatigue, he went a long\nway  round  so  as  to  get  home  from  quite  a\ndifferent direction.\nHe  was  not  fully  conscious  when  he  passed\nthrough  the  gateway  of  his  house!  he  was\nalready  on  the  staircase  before  he  recollected\nthe  axe.  And  yet  he  had  a  very  grave  problem\nbefore  him,  to  put  it  back  and  to  escape\nobservation  as  far  as  possible  in  doing  so.  He\nwas  of  course  incapable  of  reflecting  that  it\nmight  perhaps  be  far  better  not  to  restore  the\naxe at all, but to drop it later on in somebody's\nyard. But it all happened fortunately, the door of\nthe porter's room was closed but not locked, so\nthat it seemed most likely that the porter was at\nhome. But he had so completely lost all power\nof reflection that he walked straight to the door", "and  opened  it.  If  the  porter  had  asked  him,\n'What  do  you  want?'  he  would  perhaps  have\nsimply handed him the axe. But again the porter\nwas not at home, and he succeeded in putting\nthe  axe  back  under  the  bench,  and  even\ncovering it with the chunk of wood as before. He\nmet  no  one,  not  a  soul,  afterwards  on  the  way\nto his room; the landlady's door was shut.

At  last  he  noticed  that  it  was\nbeginning to get light. He was lying on his back,\nstill  dazed  from  his  recent  oblivion.  Fearful,\ndespairing  cries  rose  shrilly  from  the  street,\nsounds  which  he  heard  every  night,  indeed,\nunder his window after two o'clock. They woke\nhim up now.\n'Ah!  the  drunken  men  are  coming  out  of  the\ntaverns,'  he  thought,  'it's  past  two  o'clock,'  and\nat once he leaped up, as though someone had\npulled him from the sofa.\n'What!

A  dreadful  chill  came  over  him;  but  the\nchill  was  from  the  fever  that  had  begun  long\nbefore in his sleep. Now he was suddenly taken\nwith violent shivering, so that his teeth chattered\nand all his limbs were shaking. He opened the\ndoor  and  began  listening-everything  in  the\nhouse  was  asleep.

There  was  light\nenough, and he began hurriedly looking himself\nall over from head to foot, all his clothes; were\nthere no traces? But there was no doing it like\nthat;  shivering  with  cold,  he  began  taking  off\neverything  and  looking  over  again.  He  turned\neverything  over  to  the  last  threads  and  rags,", "and  mistrusting  himself,  went  through  his\nsearch three times.\nBut  there  seemed  to  be  nothing,  no  trace,\nexcept in one place, where some thick drops of\ncongealed  blood  were  clinging  to  the  frayed\nedge  of  his  trousers.  He  picked  up  a  big\nclaspknife and cut off the frayed threads. There\nseemed to be nothing more.\nSuddenly  he  remembered  that  the  purse  and\nthe things he had taken out of the old woman's\nbox were still in his pockets! He had not thought\ntill then of taking them out and hiding them! He\nhad  not  even  thought  of  them  while  he  was\nexamining  his  clothes!  What  next?  Instantly  he\nrushed  to  take  them  out  and  fling  them  on  the\ntable.  When  he  had  pulled  out  everything,  and\nturned  the  pocket  inside  out  to  be  sure  there\nwas  nothing  left,  he  carried  the  whole  heap  to\nthe corner.

My  reason's  deserting\nme-simply!'\nHe sat down on the sofa in exhaustion and was\nat  once  shaken  by  another  unbearable  fit  of\nshivering.

The  conviction  that  all  his\nfaculties, even memory, Free eBooks at Planet\neBook.com  1(cid:24)(cid:24)  and  the  simplest  power  of\nreflection  were  failing  him,  began  to  be  an\ninsufferable torture.\n'Surely  it  isn't  beginning  already!  Surely  it  isn't\nmy punishment coming upon me?

Suddenly he remembered that there\nhad  been  blood  on  the  purse  too.  'Ah!  Then\nthere must be blood on the pocket too, for I put\nthe wet purse in my pocket!'\nIn  a  flash  he  had  turned  the  pocket  inside  out\nand, yes!-there were traces, stains on the lining\nof the pocket!\n'So my reason has not quite deserted me, so I\nstill  have  some  sense  and  memory,  since  I\nguessed  it  of  myself,'  he  thought  triumphantly,\nwith  a  deep  sigh  of  relief;  'it's  simply  the\nweakness  of  fever,  a  moment's  delirium,'  and\nhe tore the whole lining out of the left pocket of\nhis  trousers.

Where am 1 I to put the sock and\nrags and pocket?'\nHe gathered them all up in his hands and stood\nin the middle of the room.\n'In the stove? But they would ransack the stove\nfirst of all.

Yes,\nbetter throw it away,' he repeated, sitting down\non  the  sofa  again,  'and  at  once,  this  minute,\nwithout lingering ...'\nBut his head sank on the pillow instead. Again\nthe  unbearable  icy  shivering  came  over  him;\nagain he drew his coat over him.\nAnd  for  a  long  while,  for  some  hours,  he  was\nhaunted by the impulse to 'go off somewhere at\nonce, this moment, and fling it all away, so that\nit may be out of sight and done with, at once, at\nonce!'

What  have  you  got\nthere?'\nHe looked; in his right hand he held the shreds\nhe had cut from his trousers, the sock, and the\nrags  of  the  pocket.  1  So  he  had  been  asleep\nwith  them  in  his  hand.  Afterwards  reflecting\nupon  it,  he  remembered  that  half  waking  up  in\nhis  fever,  he  had  grasped  all  this  tightly  in  his\nhand and so fallen asleep again.\n'Look at the rags he's collected and sleeps with\nthem,  as  though  he  has  got  hold  of  a  treasure\n...'\nAnd  Nastasya  went  off  into  her  hysterical\ngiggle.", "Instantly he thrust them all under his great coat\nand fixed his eyes intently upon her.

'But ... the police?'\n'You'd  better  have  some  tea!  Yes?  I'll  bring  it,\nthere's some left.'\n'No  ...  I'm  going;  I'll  go  at  once,'  he  muttered,\ngetting on to his feet.\n'Why, you'll never get downstairs!'\n'Yes, I'll go.'\n'As you please.'\nShe followed the porter out.\nAt  once  he  rushed  to  the  light  to  examine  the\nsock and the rags.\n'There  are  stains,  but  not  very  noticeable;  all\ncovered  with  dirt,  and  rubbed  and  already\ndiscoloured.

'Good God, only get it over soon!'\nHe  was  flinging  himself  on  his  knees  to  pray,\nbut  broke  into  laughter  -not  at  the  idea  of\nprayer, but at himself.\nHe  began,  hurriedly  dressing.  'If  I'm  lost,  I  am\nlost,  I  don't  care!  Shall  I  put  the  sock  on?'  he\nsuddenly  wondered,  'it  will  get  dustier  still  and\nthe traces will be gone.'\nBut no sooner had he put it on than he pulled it\noff again in loathing and horror.

His head swam\nand ached with fever. 'It's a trick! They want to\ndecoy  me  there  and  confound  me  over\neverything,' he mused, as he went out on to the\nstairs-'the  worst  of  it  is  I'm  almost  light-headed\n... I may blurt out something stupid ...'\nOn  the  stairs  he  remembered  that  he  was\nleaving  all  the  things  just  as  they  were  in  the\nhole in the wall, 'and very likely, it's on purpose\nto search when I'm out,' he thought, 1(cid:24)0 Crime\nand Punishment and stopped short.

The sun shone straight\nin  his  eyes,  so  that  it  hurt  him  to  look  out  of\nthem,  and  he  felt  his  head  going  round-as  a\nman in a fever is apt to feel when he comes out\ninto the street on a bright sunny day.\nWhen he reached the turning into the street, in\nan agony of trepidation he looked down it ... at\nthe house ... and at once averted his eyes.\n'If they question me, perhaps I'll simply tell,' he\nthought, as he drew near the police-station.\nThe police-station was about a quarter of a mile\noff.  It  had  lately  been  moved  to  new  rooms  on\nthe  fourth  floor  of  a  new  house.  He  had  been\nonce  for  a  moment  in  the  old  office  but  long\nago.

The  kitchens  of  the  flats\nopened on to the stairs and stood open almost\nthe  whole  day.  So  there  was  a  fearful  Free\neBooks  at  Planet  eBook.com  1(cid:24)1  smell  and\nheat.  The  staircase  was  crowded  with  porters\ngoing up and down with their books under their\narms,  policemen,  and  persons  of  all  sorts  and\nboth  sexes.  The  door  of  the  office,  too,  stood\nwide  open.  Peasants  stood  waiting  within.\nThere, too, the heat was stifling and there was a\nsickening smell of fresh paint and stale oil from\nthe newly decorated rooms.\nAfter waiting a little, he decided to move forward\ninto  the  next  room.  All  the  rooms  were  small\nand low-pitched. A fearful impatience drew him\non and on. No one paid attention to him. In the", "second  room  some  clerks  sat  writing,  dressed\nhardly  better  than  he  was,  and  rather  a\nqueer-looking set. He went up to one of them.\n'What is it?'\nHe showed the notice he had received.\n'You are a student?' the man asked, glancing at\nthe notice.\n'Yes, formerly a student.'\nThe  clerk  looked  at  him,  but  without  the\nslightest interest.

One,  poorly\ndressed  in  mourning,  sat  at  the  table  opposite\nthe  1  chief  clerk,  writing  something  at  his\ndictation.  The  other,  a  very  stout,  buxom\nwoman  with  a  purplish-red,  blotchy  face,\nexcessively  smartly  dressed  with  a  brooch  on\nher bosom as big as a saucer, was standing on\none  side,  apparently  waiting  for  something.\nRaskolnikov  thrust  his  notice  upon  the  head\nclerk.  The  latter  glanced  at  it,  said:  'Wait  a\nminute,'  and  went  on  attending  to  the  lady  in\nmourning.\nHe breathed more freely. 'It can't be that!'\nBy  degrees  he  began  to  regain  confidence,  he\nkept  urging  himself  to  have  courage  and  be\ncalm.\n'Some  foolishness,  some  trifling  carelessness,\nand I may betray myself! Hm ... it's a pity there's\nno  air  here,'  he  added,  'it's  stifling....  It  makes\none's head dizzier than ever ... and one's mind\ntoo ...'\nHe was conscious of a terrible inner turmoil. ", "He was afraid of losing his self-control; he tried\nto  catch  at  something  and  fix  his  mind  on  it,\nsomething  quite  irrelevant,  but  he  could  not\nsucceed in this at all. Yet the head clerk greatly\ninterested  him,  he  kept  hoping  to  see  through\nhim and guess something from his face.\nHe  was  a  very  young  man,  about  two  and\ntwenty,  with  a  dark  mobile  face  that  looked\nolder than his years. \nHe  was  fashionably  dressed  and  foppish,  with\nhis  hair  parted  in  the  middle,  well  combed  and\npomaded,  and  wore  a  number  of  rings  on  his\nwell-scrubbed  fingers  and  a  gold  chain  on  his\nwaistcoat. He said a couple of words in French\nto  a  foreigner  who  was  in  the  room,  and  said\nthem fairly correctly.\n'Luise  Ivanovna,  you  can  sit  down,'  he  said\ncasually  to  the  gaily-  dressed,  purple-faced\nlady, who was still standing as Free eBooks at\nPlanet eBook.com 1(cid:24)(cid:24) though not venturing to sit\ndown, though there was a chair beside her.\n'Ich  danke,'  said  the  latter,  and  softly,  with  a\nrustle  of  silk  she  sank  into  the  chair.

But\nshe  was  obviously  embarrassed  at  filling  half\nthe room and smelling so strongly of scent; and\nthough  her  smile  was  impudent  as  well  as\ncringing, it betrayed evident uneasiness.\nThe lady in mourning had done at last, and got\nup.  All  at  once,  with  some  noise,  an  officer\nwalked in very jauntily, with a peculiar swing of\nhis  shoulders  at  each  step.  He  tossed  his\ncockaded cap on the table and sat down in an\neasy-chair.  The  small  lady  positively  skipped\nfrom  her  seat  on  seeing  him,  and  fell  to\ncurtsying  in  a  sort  of  ecstasy;  but  the  officer\ntook not the smallest notice of her, and she did\nnot  venture  to  sit  down  again  in  his  presence.\nHe was the assistant superintendent. He had a\nreddish  moustache  that  stood  out  horizontally\non  each  side  of  his  face,  and  extremely  small\nfeatures,  expressive  of  nothing  much  except  a\ncertain  insolence.  He  looked  askance  and\nrather  indignantly  at  Raskolnikov;  he  was  so\nvery  badly  dressed,  and  in  spite  of  his\nhumiliating  position,  his  bearing  was  by  no\nmeans in keeping with his clothes.

'You are told\nto come at nine, and now it's twelve!'", "'The notice was only brought me a quarter of an\nhour  ago,'  Raskolnikov  answered  loudly  over\nhis shoulder.

'You\nmust give a written undertaking but as for your\nlove affairs and all these tragic events, we have\nnothing to do with that.'\n'Come now ... you are harsh,' muttered Nikodim\nFomitch,  sitting  down  at  the  table  and  also\nbeginning to write. He looked a little ashamed.\n'Write!' said the head clerk to Raskolnikov.", "'Write what?' the latter asked, gruffly.\n'I will dictate to you.'\nRaskolnikov fancied that the head clerk treated\nhim more casually and contemptuously after his\nspeech,  but  strange  to  say  he  suddenly  felt\ncompletely  indifferent  to  anyone's  opinion,  and\nthis  revulsion  took  place  in  a  flash,  in  one\ninstant. If he had cared to think a little, he would\nhave  been  amazed  indeed  that  he  could  have\ntalked to them like that a minute before, forcing\nhis  feelings  upon  them.  And  where  had  those\nfeelings come from? Now if the whole room had\nbeen  filled,  not  with  police  officers,  but  with\nthose nearest and dearest to him, he would not\nhave found one human word for them, so empty\nwas his heart. A gloomy sensation of agonising,\neverlasting  solitude  and  remoteness,  took\nconscious  form  in  his  soul.  It  was  not  the\nmeanness  of  his  sentimental  effusions  before\nIlya Petrovitch, nor the meanness of the latter's\ntriumph  over  him  that  had  caused  this  sudden\nrevulsion  in  his  heart.  Oh,  what  had  he  to  do\nnow with his own baseness, with all these petty\nvanities,  officers,  German  women,  debts,\npolice- offices? If he had been Free eBooks at", "Planet eBook.com 1(cid:24)(cid:24) sentenced to be burnt at\nthat  moment,  he  would  not  have  stirred,  would\nhardly  have  heard  the  sentence  to  the  end.\nSomething was happening to him entirely new,\nsudden  and  unknown.  It  was  not  that  he\nunderstood,  but  he  felt  clearly  with  all  the\nintensity of sensation that he could never more\nappeal to these people in the police-office with\nsentimental effusions like his recent outburst, or\nwith  anything  whatever;  and  that  if  they  had\nbeen  his  own  brothers  and  sisters  and  not\npolice-officers, it would have been utterly out of\nthe  question  to  appeal  to  them  in  any\ncircumstance of life. He had never experienced\nsuch  a  strange  and  awful  sensation.  And  what\nwas  most  agonising-it  was  more  a  sensation\nthan  a  conception  or  idea,  a  direct  sensation,\nthe most agonising of all the sensations he had\nknown in his life.\nThe head clerk began dictating to him the usual\nform  of  declaration,  that  he  could  not  pay,  that\nhe undertook to do so at a future date, that he\nwould not leave the town, nor sell his property,\nand so on.\n'But  you  can't  write,  you  can  hardly  hold  the", "pen,'  observed  the  head  clerk,  looking  with\ncuriosity at Raskolnikov. 'Are you ill?'\n'Yes, I am giddy. Go on!'\n'That's all. Sign it.'\nThe  head  clerk  took  the  paper,  and  turned  to\nattend to others.\nRaskolnikov  gave  back  the  pen;  but  instead  of\ngetting  up  and  going  away,  he  put  his  elbows\non the table and pressed his head in his hands.\nHe  felt  as  if  a  nail  were  being  driven  into  his\nskull. A strange idea suddenly occurred to him,\nto  1  get  up  at  once,  to  go  up  to  Nikodim\nFomitch,  and  tell  him  everything  that  had\nhappened yesterday, and then to go with him to\nhis  lodgings  and  to  show  him  the  things  in  the\nhole  in  the  corner.  The  impulse  was  so  strong\nthat  he  got  up  from  his  seat  to  carry  it  out.\n'Hadn't I better think a minute?' flashed through\nhis mind. 'No, better cast off the burden without\nthinking.' But all at once he stood still, rooted to\nthe  spot.  Nikodim  Fomitch  was  talking  eagerly\nwith Ilya Petrovitch, and the words reached him:", "'It's  impossible,  they'll  both  be  released.  To\nbegin  with,  the  whole  story  contradicts  itself.\nWhy should they have called the porter, if it had\nbeen  their  doing?  To  inform  against\nthemselves?  Or  as  a  blind?  No,  that  would  be\ntoo  cunning!  Besides,  Pestryakov,  the  student,\nwas seen at the gate by both the porters and a\nwoman  as  he  went  in.  He  was  walking  with\nthree friends, who left him only at the gate, and\nhe  asked  the  porters  to  direct  him,  in  the\npresence  of  the  friends.  Now,  would  he  have\nasked  his  way  if  he  had  been  going  with  such\nan object?

He  had,  of  course,  come  to\nlook at the sick man when he fainted, but retired\nat once when he recovered.\n'Since  yesterday,'  muttered  Raskolnikov  in\nreply.1 'Did you go out yesterday?''Yes.'\n'Though you were ill?''Yes.'\n'At what time?'\n'About seven.'\n'And where did you go, my I ask?'", "'Along the street.'\n'Short and clear.'\nRaskolnikov,  white  as  a  handkerchief,  had\nanswered  sharply,  jerkily,  without  dropping  his\nblack  feverish  eyes  before  Ilya  Petrovitch's\nstare.\n'He  can  scarcely  stand  upright.  And  you  ...'\nNikodim Fomitch was beginning.\n'No  matter,'  Ilya  Petrovitch  pronounced  rather\npeculiarly.\nNikodim  Fomitch  would  have  made  some\nfurther  protest,  but  glancing  at  the  head  clerk\nwho  was  looking  very  hard  at  him,  he  did  not\nspeak.  There  was  a  sudden  silence.  It  was\nstrange.\n'Very well, then,' concluded Ilya Petrovitch, 'we\nwill not detain you.'\nRaskolnikov  went  out.  He  caught  the  sound  of\neager conversation on his departure, and above", "the  rest  rose  the  questioning  voice  of  Nikodim\nFomitch.  In  the  street,  his  faintness  passed  off\ncompletely.\n'A  search-there  will  be  a  search  at  once,'  he\nrepeated to himself, hurrying home.

Nothing and no one in\nit.  No  one  had  peeped  in.  Even  Nastasya  had\nnot touched it. But heavens! how could he have\nleft all those things in the hole?\nHe rushed to the corner, slipped his hand under\nthe  paper,  pulled  the  things  out  and  lined  his\npockets with them. There were eight articles in\nall:  two  little  boxes  with  ear-rings  or  something\nof  the  sort,  he  hardly  looked  to  see;  then  four\nsmall  leather  cases.  There  was  a  chain,  too,\nmerely  wrapped  in  newspaper  and  something\nelse  in  newspaper,  that  looked  like  a\ndecoration....  He  put  them  all  in  the  different\npockets  of  his  overcoat,  and  the  remaining\npocket of his trousers, trying to conceal them as\nmuch as possible. He took the purse, too. Then\nhe went out of his room, leaving the door open.\nHe  walked  quickly  and  resolutely,  and  though\nhe felt shattered, he had his senses about him.", "He  was  afraid  of  pursuit,  he  was  afraid  that  in\nanother  half-hour,  another  quarter  of  an  hour\nperhaps,  instructions  would  be  issued  for  his\npursuit,  and  so  at  all  costs,  he  must  hide  all\ntraces before then. He must clear everything up\nwhile  he  still  had  some  strength,  some\nreasoning  power  left  him....  Where  was  he  to\ngo?\nThat had long been settled: 'Fling them into the\ncanal, 1 and all traces hidden in the water, the\nthing would be at an end.' So he had decided in\nthe night of his delirium when several times he\nhad had the impulse to get up and go away, to\nmake haste, and get rid of it all. But to get rid of\nit,  turned  out  to  be  a  very  difficult  task.  He\nwandered  along  the  bank  of  the  Ekaterininsky\nCanal  for  half  an  hour  or  more  and  looked\nseveral times at the steps running down to the\nwater, but he could not think of carrying out his\nplan;  either  rafts  stood  at  the  steps'  edge,  and\nwomen were washing clothes on them, or boats\nwere moored there, and people were swarming\neverywhere.  Moreover  he  could  be  seen  and\nnoticed  from  the  banks  on  all  sides;  it  would\nlook  suspicious  for  a  man  to  go  down  on\npurpose,  stop,  and  throw  something  into  the", "water.  And  what  if  the  boxes  were  to  float\ninstead  of  sinking?  And  of  course  they  would.\nEven  as  it  was,  everyone  he  met  seemed  to\nstare and look round, as if they had nothing to\ndo but to watch him. 'Why is it, or can it be my\nfancy?' he thought.\nAt  last  the  thought  struck  him  that  it  might  be\nbetter  to  go  to  the  Neva.  There  were  not  so\nmany people there, he would be less observed,\nand it would be more convenient in every way,\nabove  all  it  was  further  off.  He  wondered  how\nhe could have been wandering for a good half-\nhour,  worried  and  anxious  in  this  dangerous\npast  without  thinking  of  it  before.  And  that\nhalf-hour  he  had  lost  over  an  irrational  plan,\nsimply because he had thought of it in delirium!\nHe had become extremely absent and forgetful\nand he was aware of it. He certainly must make\nhaste.\nHe  walked  towards  the  Neva  along  V--\nProspect,  but  Free  eBooks  at  Planet\neBook.com  1(cid:24)(cid:24)  on  the  way  another  idea  struck\nhim. 'Why to the Neva? Would it not be better to\ngo somewhere far off, to the Islands again, and\nthere hide the things in some solitary place, in a", "wood  or  under  a  bush,  and  mark  the  spot\nperhaps?' And though he felt incapable of clear\njudgment, the idea seemed to him a sound one.\nBut he was not destined to go there. For coming\nout of V-- Prospect towards the square, he saw\non  the  left  a  passage  leading  between  two\nblank  walls  to  a  courtyard.  On  the  right  hand,\nthe  blank  unwhitewashed  wall  of  a  four-storied\nhouse stretched far into the court; on the left, a\nwooden  hoarding  ran  parallel  with  it  for  twenty\npaces into the court, and then turned sharply to\nthe  left.  Here  was  a  deserted  fenced-off  place\nwhere rubbish of different sorts was lying. At the\nend  of  the  court,  the  corner  of  a  low,  smutty,\nstone shed, apparently part of some workshop,\npeeped  from  behind  the  hoarding.  It  was\nprobably  a  carriage  builder's  or  carpenter's\nshed;  the  whole  place  from  the  entrance  was\nblack with coal dust. Here would be the place to\nthrow  it,  he  thought.  Not  seeing  anyone  in  the\nyard,  he  slipped  in,  and  at  once  saw  near  the\ngate a sink, such as is often put in yards where\nthere are many workmen or cabdrivers; and on\nthe hoarding above had been scribbled in chalk\nthe  time-honoured  witticism,  'Standing  here\nstrictly  forbidden.'  This  was  all  the  better,  for\nthere  would  be  nothing  suspicious  about  his", "going in. 'Here I could throw it all in a heap and\nget away!'\nLooking round once more, with his hand already\nin his pocket, he noticed against the outer wall,\nbetween  the  entrance  and  the  sink,  a  big\nunhewn stone, weighing perhaps 1(cid:24)0 Crime and\nPunishment sixty pounds. The other side of the\nwall  was  a  street.  He  could  hear  passers-by,\nalways numerous in that part, but he could not\nbe  seen  from  the  entrance,  unless  someone\ncame  in  from  the  street,  which  might  well\nhappen indeed, so there was need of haste.\nHe bent down over the stone, seized the top of\nit firmly in both hands, and using all his strength\nturned  it  over.  Under  the  stone  was  a  small\nhollow  in  the  ground,  and  he  immediately\nemptied his pocket into it. The purse lay at the\ntop, and yet the hollow was not filled up. Then\nhe  seized  the  stone  again  and  with  one  twist\nturned  it  back,  so  that  it  was  in  the  same\nposition  again,  though  it  stood  a  very  little\nhigher.  But  he  scraped  the  earth  about  it  and\npressed  it  at  the  edges  with  his  foot.  Nothing\ncould be noticed.", "Then  he  went  out,  and  turned  into  the  square.\nAgain  an  intense,  almost  unbearable  joy\noverwhelmed him for an instant, as it had in the\npolice-office. 'I have buried my tracks! And who,\nwho  can  think  of  looking  under  that  stone?  It\nhas been lying there most likely ever since the\nhouse  was  built,  and  will  lie  as  many  years\nmore.  And  if  it  were  found,  who  would  think  of\nme?  It  is  all  over!  No  clue!'  And  he  laughed.\nYes, he remembered that he began laughing a\nthin,  nervous  noiseless  laugh,  and  went  on\nlaughing  all  the  time  he  was  crossing  the\nsquare. But when he reached the K-- Boulevard\nwhere two days before he had come upon that\ngirl,  his  laughter  suddenly  ceased.  Other  ideas\ncrept  into  his  mind.  He  felt  all  at  once  that  it\nwould be loathsome to pass that seat on which\nafter  the  girl  was  gone,  he  had  sat  and\npondered,  and  that  it  would  be  hateful,  too,  to\nmeet that Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 1(cid:24)1\nwhiskered policeman to whom he had given the\ntwenty copecks: 'Damn him!'\nHe  walked,  looking  about  him  angrily  and\ndistractedly.  All  his  ideas  now  seemed  to  be\ncircling round some single point, and he felt that\nthere  really  was  such  a  point,  and  that  now,", "now,  he  was  left  facing  that  point-and  for  the\nfirst time, indeed, during the last two months.\n'Damn  it  all!'  he  thought  suddenly,  in  a  fit  of\nungovernable  fury.  'If  it  has  begun,  then  it  has\nbegun.  Hang  the  new  life!  Good  Lord,  how\nstupid it is! ... And what lies I told to-day! How\ndespicably  I  fawned  upon  that  wretched  Ilya\nPetrovitch! But that is all folly! What do I care for\nthem  all,  and  my  fawning  upon  them!  It  is  not\nthat at all! It is not that at all!'\nSuddenly he stopped; a new utterly unexpected\nand exceedingly simple question perplexed and\nbitterly confounded him.\n'If  it  all  has  really  been  done  deliberately  and\nnot  idiotically,  if  I  really  had  a  certain  and\ndefinite  object,  how  is  it  I  did  not  even  glance\ninto the purse and don't know what I had there,\nfor which I have undergone these agonies, and\nhave  deliberately  undertaken  this  base,  filthy\ndegrading business? And here I wanted at once\nto  throw  into  the  water  the  purse  together  with\nall  the  things  which  I  had  not  seen  either  ...\nhow's that?'", "Yes,  that  was  so,  that  was  all  so.  Yet  he  had\nknown  it  all  before,  and  it  was  not  a  new\nquestion  for  him,  even  when  it  was  decided  in\nthe  night  without  hesitation  and  consideration,\nas though so it must be, as though it could not 1\npossibly  be  otherwise....  Yes,  he  had  known  it\nall, and understood it all; it surely had all been\nsettled even yesterday at the moment when he\nwas  bending  over  the  box  and  pulling  the\njewel-cases out of it.... Yes, so it was.\n'It is because I am very ill,' he decided grimly at\nlast,  'I  have  been  worrying  and  fretting  myself,\nand I don't know what I am doing.... Yesterday\nand the day before yesterday and all this time I\nhave  been  worrying  myself....  I  shall  get  well\nand  I  shall  not  worry....  But  what  if  I  don't  get\nwell at all? Good God, how sick I am of it all!'\nHe walked on without resting. He had a terrible\nlonging  for  some  distraction,  but  he  did  not\nknow  what  to  do,  what  to  attempt.  A  new\noverwhelming sensation was gaining more and\nmore mastery over him every moment; this was\nan immeasurable, almost physical, repulsion for\neverything  surrounding  him,  an  obstinate,\nmalignant  feeling  of  hatred.  All  who  met  him", "were  loathsome  to  him-he  loathed  their  faces,\ntheir movements, their gestures. If anyone had\naddressed him, he felt that he might have spat\nat him or bitten him....\nHe  stopped  suddenly,  on  coming  out  on  the\nbank  of  the  Little  Neva,  near  the  bridge  to\nVassilyevsky Ostrov. 'Why, he lives here, in that\nhouse,'  he  thought,  'why,  I  have  not  come  to\nRazumihin  of  my  own  accord!  Here  it's  the\nsame  thing  over  again....  Very  interesting  to\nknow, though; have I come on purpose or have\nI simply walked here by chance?

It was four months since they had seen\neach  other.  Razumihin  was  sitting  in  a  ragged\ndressing-gown,  with  slippers  on  his  bare  feet,\nunkempt,  unshaven  and  unwashed.  His  face\nshowed surprise.", "'Is it you?' he cried. He looked his comrade up\nand down; then after a brief pause, he whistled.\n'As hard up as all that! Why, brother, you've cut\nme out!' he added, looking at \nRaskolnikov's  rags.  'Come  sit  down,  you  are\ntired, I'll be bound.'\nAnd when he had sunk down on the American\nleather sofa, which was in even worse condition\nthan  his  own,  Razumihin  saw  at  once  that  his\nvisitor was ill.\n'Why,  you  are  seriously  ill,  do  you  know  that?'\nHe began feeling his pulse. Raskolnikov pulled\naway his hand.\n'Never  mind,'  he  said,  'I  have  come  for  this:  I\nhave no lessons.... I wanted, ... but I don't really\nwant lessons....'\n'But  I  say!  You  are  delirious,  you  know!'\nRazumihin observed, watching him carefully.\n'No, I am not.'\nRaskolnikov  got  up  from  the  sofa.  As  he  had", "mounted  the  stairs  to  Razumihin's,  he  had  not\nrealised  that  he  would  be  meeting  his  friend\nface to face. Now, in a flash, he knew, that what\nhe was least of all disposed for at that moment\nwas to be face to face with anyone in the wide\nworld.  His  spleen  rose  within  him.  He  almost\nchoked  with  rage  at  himself  as  soon  as  he\ncrossed Razumihin's threshold.1 'Good-bye,' he\nsaid abruptly, and walked to the door.\n'Stop, stop! You queer fish.'\n'I  don't  want  to,'  said  the  other,  again  pulling\naway his hand.\n'Then  why  the  devil  have  you  come?  Are  you\nmad, or what? Why, this is ... almost insulting! I\nwon't let you go like that.'\n'Well,  then,  I  came  to  you  because  I  know  no\none  but  you  who  could  help  ...  to  begin  ...\nbecause you are kinder than anyone- cleverer, I\nmean,  and  can  judge  ...  and  now  I  see  that  I\nwant nothing.

You  are  a  perfect\nmadman.  As  you  like  for  all  I  care.  I  have  no\nlessons, do you see, and I don't care about that,\nbut  there's  a  bookseller,  Heruvimov-and  he\ntakes  the  place  of  a  lesson.  I  would  not\nexchange  him  for  five  lessons.  He's  doing\npublishing of a kind, and issuing natural science\nmanuals and what a circulation they have! The\nvery  titles  are  worth  the  money!

Now he\nis setting up for being advanced, not that he has\nan  inkling  of  anything,  but,  of  course,  I\nencourage him. Here are two signatures of the\nGerman  text-in  my  opinion,  the  crudest\ncharlatanism;  it  discusses  the  question,  'Is\nwoman  a  human  being?'  And,  of  course,\ntriumphantly  proves  that  she  is.  Heruvimov  is\ngoing to bring out this work as a contribution to\nthe woman question; I am translating it; he will\nexpand  these  two  and  a  half  signatures  Free\neBooks  at  Planet  eBook.com  1(cid:24)(cid:24)  into  six,  we\nshall make up a gorgeous title half a page long\nand  bring  it  out  at  half  a  rouble.

You may be sure I don't contradict\nhim,  hang  him!  Well,  would  you  like  to  do  the\nsecond signature of 'Is woman a human being?'\nIf  you  would,  take  the  German  and  pens  and\npaper-all  those  are  provided,  and  take  three\nroubles;  for  as  I  have  had  six  roubles  in\nadvance on the whole thing, three roubles come\nto  you  for  your  share.  And  when  you  have\nfinished  the  signature  there  will  be  another\nthree  roubles  for  you.  And  please  don't  think  I\nam  doing  you  a  service;  quite  the  contrary,  as\nsoon as you came in, I saw how you could help\nme;  to  begin  with,  I  am  weak  in  spelling,  and\nsecondly,  I  am  sometimes  utterly  adrift  in\nGerman, so that I make it up as I go along for\nthe  most  part.  The  only  comfort  is,  that  it's\nbound  to  be  a  change  for  the  better.  Though\nwho  can  tell,  maybe  it's  sometimes  for  the\nworse. Will you take it?'\nRaskolnikov took the German sheets in silence,", "took the three roubles and without a word went\nout.  Razumihin  gazed  after  him  in\nastonishment. But when Raskolnikov was in the\nnext street, he turned back, mounted the stairs\nto Razumihin's again and laying on the table the\nGerman article and the three roubles, went out\nagain, still without 1 uttering a word.\n'Are  you  raving,  or  what?'  Razumihin  shouted,\nroused to fury at last. 'What farce is this? You'll\ndrive me crazy too ... what did you come to see\nme for, damn you?'\n'I  don't  want  ...  translation,'  muttered\nRaskolnikov from the stairs.\n'Then  what  the  devil  do  you  want?'  shouted\nRazumihin  from  above.  Raskolnikov  continued\ndescending the staircase in silence.\n'Hey, there! Where are you living?'\nNo answer.\n'Well, confound you then!'\nBut  Raskolnikov  was  already  stepping  into  the", "street.  On  the  Nikolaevsky  Bridge  he  was\nroused  to  full  consciousness  again  by  an\nunpleasant  incident.  A  coachman,  after\nshouting at him two or three times, gave him a\nviolent  lash  on  the  back  with  his  whip,  for\nhaving  almost  fallen  under  his  horses'  hoofs.\nThe lash so infuriated him that he dashed away\nto the railing (for some unknown reason he had\nbeen walking in the very middle of the bridge in\nthe traffic). He angrily clenched and ground his\nteeth. He heard laughter, of course.\n'Serves him right!'\n'A pickpocket I dare say.'\n'Pretending  to  be  drunk,  for  sure,  and  getting\nunder the wheels on purpose; and you have to\nanswer for him.'\n'It's a regular profession, that's what it is.'\nBut  while  he  stood  at  the  railing,  still  looking\nangry  and  bewildered  after  the  retreating\ncarriage, and rubbing his Free eBooks at Planet\neBook.com 1(cid:24)(cid:24) back, he suddenly felt someone\nthrust  money  into  his  hand.  He  looked.  It  was", "an  elderly  woman  in  a  kerchief  and  goatskin\nshoes,  with  a  girl,  probably  her  daughter\nwearing a hat, and carrying a green parasol.\n'Take it, my good man, in Christ's name.'\nHe took it and they passed on. It was a piece of\ntwenty  copecks.  From  his  dress  and\nappearance they might well have taken him for\na beggar asking alms in the streets, and the gift\nof the twenty copecks he doubtless owed to the\nblow, which made them feel sorry for him.\nHe  closed  his  hand  on  the  twenty  copecks,\nwalked on for ten paces, and turned facing the\nNeva, looking towards the palace. The sky was\nwithout a cloud and the water was almost bright\nblue,  which  is  so  rare  in  the  Neva.  The  cupola\nof the cathedral, which is seen at its best from\nthe bridge about twenty paces from the chapel,\nglittered  in  the  sunlight,  and  in  the  pure  air\nevery  ornament  on  it  could  be  clearly\ndistinguished.  The  pain  from  the  lash  went  off,\nand  Raskolnikov  forgot  about  it;  one  uneasy\nand  not  quite  definite  idea  occupied  him  now\ncompletely.  He  stood  still,  and  gazed  long  and\nintently  into  the  distance;  this  spot  was", "especially  familiar  to  him.  When  he  was\nattending  the  university,  he  had  hundreds  of\ntimes-generally  on  his  way  home-stood  still  on\nthis  spot,  gazed  at  this  truly  magnificent\nspectacle  and  almost  always  marvelled  at  a\nvague and mysterious emotion it roused in him.\nIt  left  him  strangely  cold;  this  gorgeous  picture\nwas  for  him  blank  and  lifeless.  He  wondered\nevery  time  at  his  sombre  and  enigmatic\nimpression  and,  mistrusting  himself,  put  off\nfinding  the  explanation  of  it.  He  vividly  1\nrecalled those old doubts and perplexities, and\nit  seemed  to  him  that  it  was  no  mere  chance\nthat  he  recalled  them  now.  It  struck  him  as\nstrange  and  grotesque,  that  he  should  have\nstopped at the same spot as before, as though\nhe  actually  imagined  he  could  think  the  same\nthoughts,  be  interested  in  the  same  theories\nand pictures that had interested him ... so short\na time ago. He felt it almost amusing, and yet it\nwrung  his  heart.  Deep  down,  hidden  far  away\nout  of  sight  all  that  seemed  to  him  now-all  his\nold past, his old thoughts, his old problems and\ntheories,  his  old  impressions  and  that  picture\nand  himself  and  all,  all....  He  felt  as  though  he\nwere  flying  upwards,  and  everything  were\nvanishing  from  his  sight.  Making  an", "unconscious  movement  with  his  hand,  he\nsuddenly became aware of the piece of money\nin  his  fist.  He  opened  his  hand,  stared  at  the\ncoin,  and  with  a  sweep  of  his  arm  flung  it  into\nthe  water;  then  he  turned  and  went  home.  It\nseemed  to  him,  he  had  cut  himself  off  from\neveryone and from everything at that moment.\nEvening  was  coming  on  when  he  reached\nhome, so that he must have been walking about\nsix hours. How and where he came back he did\nnot  remember.  Undressing,  and  quivering  like\nan  overdriven  horse,  he  lay  down  on  the  sofa,\ndrew his greatcoat over him, and at once sank\ninto oblivion....\nIt was dusk when he was waked up by a fearful\nscream.  Good  God,  what  a  scream!  Such\nunnatural  sounds,  such  howling,  wailing,\ngrinding, tears, blows and curses he had never\nheard.\nHe  could  never  have  imagined  such  brutality,\nsuch  frenzy.  In  terror  he  sat  up  in  bed,  almost\nswooning  with  agony.  But  Free  eBooks  at\nPlanet  eBook.com  1(cid:24)(cid:24)  the  fighting,  wailing  and\ncursing grew louder and louder. And then to his", "intense  amazement  he  caught  the  voice  of  his\nlandlady.  She  was  howling,  shrieking  and\nwailing,  rapidly,  hurriedly,  incoherently,  so  that\nhe  could  not  make  out  what  she  was  talking\nabout; she was beseeching, no doubt, not to be\nbeaten,  for  she  was  being  mercilessly  beaten\non the stairs. The voice of her assailant was so\nhorrible from spite and rage that it was almost a\ncroak;  but  he,  too,  was  saying  something,  and\njust  as  quickly  and  indistinctly,  hurrying  and\nspluttering.  All  at  once  Raskolnikov  trembled;\nhe recognised the voice-it was the voice of Ilya\nPetrovitch. Ilya Petrovitch here and beating the\nlandlady!  He  is  kicking  her,  banging  her  head\nagainst  the  steps-that's  clear,  that  can  be  told\nfrom the sounds, from the cries and the thuds.\nHow  is  it,  is  the  world  topsy-turvy?  He  could\nhear  people  running  in  crowds  from  all  the\nstoreys and all the staircases; he heard voices,\nexclamations,  knocking,  doors  banging.  'But\nwhy,  why,  and  how  could  it  be?'  he  repeated,\nthinking  seriously  that  he  had  gone  mad.  But\nno,  he  heard  too  distinctly!  And  they  would\ncome  to  him  then  next,  'for  no  doubt  ...  it's  all\nabout that ... about yesterday.... Good God!' He\nwould have fastened his door with the latch, but\nhe could not lift his hand ... besides, it would be", "useless.  Terror  gripped  his  heart  like  ice,\ntortured  him  and  numbed  him....  But  at  last  all\nthis uproar, after continuing about ten minutes,\nbegan  gradually  to  subside.  The  landlady  was\nmoaning  and  groaning;  Ilya  Petrovitch  was  still\nuttering threats and curses.... But at last he, too,\nseemed  to  be  silent,  and  now  he  could  not  be\nheard.  'Can  he  have  gone  away?  Good  Lord!'\nYes,  and  1(cid:24)0  Crime  and  Punishment  now  the\nlandlady is going too, still weeping and moaning\n...  and  then  her  door  slammed....  Now  the\ncrowd was going from the stairs to their rooms,\nexclaiming,  disputing,  calling  to  one  another,\nraising their voices to a shout, dropping them to\na  whisper.  There  must  have  been  numbers  of\nthem-almost  all  the  inmates  of  the  block.  'But,\ngood God, how could it be! And why, why had\nhe come here!'\nRaskolnikov  sank  worn  out  on  the  sofa,  but\ncould not close his eyes.

'For  the  last  four  days  you  have\nscarcely  eaten  or  drunk  anything.  We  had  to\ngive you tea in spoonfuls. I brought Zossimov to\nsee  you  twice.  You  remember  Zossimov?  He\nexamined you carefully and said at once it was\nnothing  serious-something  seemed  to  have\ngone  to  your  head.  Some  nervous  nonsense,\nthe result of bad feeding, he says you have not\nhad  enough  beer  and  radish,  but  it's  nothing\nmuch,  it  will  pass  and  you  will  be  all  right.\nZossimov  is  a  first-rate  fellow!  He  is  making\nquite a name. Come, I won't keep you,' he said,\naddressing  the  man  again.  'Will  you  explain\nwhat you want? You must know, Rodya, this is\nthe second time they have sent from the office;\nbut it was another man last time, and I talked to", "him. Who was it came before?'\n'That was the day before yesterday, I venture to\nsay,  if  you  please,  sir.  That  was  Alexey\nSemyonovitch; he is in our office, too.'\n'He  was  more  intelligent  than  you,  don't  you\nthink so?'\n'Yes,  indeed,  sir,  he  is  of  more  weight  than  I\nam.'\n'Quite so; go on.'\n'At  your  mamma's  request,  through  Afanasy\nIvanovitch  Vahrushin,  of  whom  I  presume  you\nhave  heard  more  than  once,  a  remittance  is\nsent  to  you  from  our  office,'  the  man  Free\neBooks  at  Planet  eBook.com  1(cid:24)(cid:24)  began,\naddressing  Raskolnikov.  'If  you  are  in  an\nintelligible  condition,  I've  thirty-five  roubles  to\nremit  to  you,  as  Semyon  Semyonovitch  has\nreceived  from  Afanasy  Ivanovitch  at  your\nmamma's request instructions to that effect, as\non previous occasions. Do you know him, sir?'\n'Yes,  I  remember  ...  Vahrushin,'  Raskolnikov", "said dreamily.\n'You  hear,  he  knows  Vahrushin,'  cried\nRazumihin.  'He  is  in  'an  intelligible  condition'!\nAnd I see you are an intelligent man too. Well,\nit's always pleasant to hear words of wisdom.'\n'That's  the  gentleman,  Vahrushin,  Afanasy\nIvanovitch. And at the request of your mamma,\nwho  has  sent  you  a  remittance  once  before  in\nthe  same  manner  through  him,  he  did  not\nrefuse  this  time  also,  and  sent  instructions  to\nSemyon  Semyonovitch  some  days  since  to\nhand you thirtyfive roubles in the hope of better\nto come.'\n'That 'hoping for better to come' is the best thing\nyou've  said,  though  'your  mamma'  is  not  bad\neither. Come then, what do you say? Is he fully\nconscious, eh?'\n'That's  all  right.  If  only  he  can  sign  this  little\npaper.'\n'He  can  scrawl  his  name.  Have  you  got  the\nbook?'", "'Yes, here's the book.'\n'Give it to me. Here, Rodya, sit up. I'll hold you.\nTake the pen and scribble 'Raskolnikov' for him.\nFor  just  now,  brother,  money  is  sweeter  to  us\nthan treacle.'\n'I don't want it,' said Raskolnikov, pushing away\nthe pen.\n'Not want it?'\n'I  won't  sign  it.'1  'How  the  devil  can  you  do\nwithout signing it?'\n'I don't want ... the money.'\n'Don't  want  the  money!  Come,  brother,  that's\nnonsense, I bear witness. Don't trouble, please,\nit's only that he is on his travels again. But that's\npretty  common  with  him  at  all  times  though....\nYou are a man of judgment and we will take him\nin hand, that is, more simply, take his hand and\nhe will sign it. Here.'\n'But I can come another time.'", "'No, no. Why should we trouble you? You are a\nman  of  judgment....  Now,  Rodya,  don't  keep\nyour visitor, you see he is waiting,' and he made\nready to hold Raskolnikov's hand in earnest.\n'Stop, I'll do it alone,' said the latter, taking the\npen and signing his name.\nThe  messenger  took  out  the  money  and  went\naway.\n'Bravo! And now, brother, are you hungry?'\n'Yes,' answered Raskolnikov.\n'Is there any soup?'\n'Some of yesterday's,' answered Nastasya, who\nwas still standing there.\n'With potatoes and rice in it?''Yes.'\n'I know it by heart. Bring soup and give us some\ntea.'\n'Very well.'", "Raskolnikov  looked  at  all  this  with  profound\nastonishment and a dull, unreasoning terror. He\nmade  up  his  mind  to  keep  quiet  and  see  what\nwould  happen.  'I  believe  I  am  not  wandering.  I\nbelieve  it's  reality,'  he  thought.Free  eBooks  at\nPlanet  eBook.com  1(cid:24)(cid:24)  In  a  couple  of  minutes\nNastasya  returned  with  the  soup,  and\nannounced that the tea would be ready directly.\nWith  the  soup  she  brought  two  spoons,  two\nplates,  salt,  pepper,  mustard  for  the  beef,  and\nso on. The table was set as it had not been for\na long time. The cloth was clean.\n'It  would  not  be  amiss,  Nastasya,  if  Praskovya\nPavlovna were to send us up a couple of bottles\nof beer. We could empty them.'\n'Well, you are a cool hand,' muttered Nastasya,\nand she departed to carry out his orders.\nRaskolnikov  still  gazed  wildly  with  strained\nattention.  Meanwhile  Razumihin  sat  down  on\nthe  sofa  beside  him,  as  clumsily  as  a  bear  put\nhis left arm round Raskolnikov's head, although\nhe  was  able  to  sit  up,  and  with  his  right  hand\ngave him a spoonful of soup, blowing on it that\nit might not burn him. But the soup was only just", "warm.  Raskolnikov  swallowed  one  spoonful\ngreedily,  then  a  second,  then  a  third.  But  after\ngiving  him  a  few  more  spoonfuls  of  soup,\nRazumihin  suddenly  stopped,  and  said  that  he\nmust  ask  Zossimov  whether  he  ought  to  have\nmore.\nNastasya came in with two bottles of beer.\n'And will you have tea?''Yes.'\n'Cut  along,  Nastasya,  and  bring  some  tea,  for\ntea we may venture on without the faculty. But\nhere  is  the  beer!'  He  moved  back  to  his  chair,\npulled  the  soup  and  meat  in  front  of  him,  and\nbegan  eating  as  though  he  had  not  touched\nfood for three days.\n'I  must  tell  you,  Rodya,  I  dine  like  this  here\nevery  day  1  now,'  he  mumbled  with  his  mouth\nfull  of  beef,  'and  it's  all  Pashenka,  your  dear\nlittle landlady, who sees to that; she loves to do\nanything for me. I don't ask for it, but, of course,\nI don't object. And here's Nastasya with the tea.\nShe  is  a  quick  girl.  Nastasya,  my  dear,  won't\nyou have some beer?'", "'Get along with your nonsense!'\n'A cup of tea, then?'\n'A cup of tea, maybe.'\n'Pour  it  out.  Stay,  I'll  pour  it  out  myself.  Sit\ndown.'\nHe poured out two cups, left his dinner, and sat\non the sofa again. As before, he put his left arm\nround  the  sick  man's  head,  raised  him  up  and\ngave  him  tea  in  spoonfuls,  again  blowing  each\nspoonful  steadily  and  earnestly,  as  though  this\nprocess  was  the  principal  and  most  effective\nmeans  towards  his  friend's  recovery.\nRaskolnikov  said  nothing  and  made  no\nresistance,  though  he  felt  quite  strong  enough\nto sit up on the sofa without support and could\nnot  merely  have  held  a  cup  or  a  spoon,  but\neven  perhaps  could  have  walked  about.  But\nfrom  some  queer,  almost  animal,  cunning  he\nconceived  the  idea  of  hiding  his  strength  and\nlying low for a time, pretending if necessary not\nto be yet in full possession of his faculties, and\nmeanwhile listening to find out what was going\non.  Yet  he  could  not  overcome  his  sense  of", "repugnance. After sipping a dozen spoonfuls of\ntea, he suddenly released his head, pushed the\nspoon away capriciously, and sank back on the\npillow.  There  were  actually  real  pillows  under\nhis head now, down pillows in clean cases, he\nobserved that, too, and took note of it.\n'Pashenka  must  give  us  some  raspberry  jam\nto-day to Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 1(cid:24)(cid:24)\nmake him some raspberry tea,' said Razumihin,\ngoing  back  to  his  chair  and  attacking  his  soup\nand beer again.\n'And  where  is  she  to  get  raspberries  for  you?'\nasked Nastasya, balancing a saucer on her five\noutspread  fingers  and  sipping  tea  through  a\nlump of sugar.\n'She'll  get  it  at  the  shop,  my  dear.  You  see,\nRodya, all sorts of things have been happening\nwhile  you  have  been  laid  up.  When  you\ndecamped  in  that  rascally  way  without  leaving\nyour  address,  I  felt  so  angry  that  I  resolved  to\nfind you out and punish you. I set to work that\nvery  day.  How  I  ran  about  making  inquiries  for\nyou!  This  lodging  of  yours  I  had  forgotten,\nthough I never remembered it, indeed, because", "I did not know it; and as for your old lodgings, I\ncould only remember it was at the Five Corners,\nHarlamov's  house.  I  kept  trying  to  find  that\nHarlamov's house, and afterwards it turned out\nthat it was not Harlamov's, but Buch's. How one\nmuddles  up  sound  sometimes!  So  I  lost  my\ntemper,  and  I  went  on  the  chance  to  the\naddress bureau next day, and only fancy, in two\nminutes they looked you up! Your name is down\nthere.'\n'My name!'\n'I  should  think  so;  and  yet  a  General  Kobelev\nthey could not find while I was there. Well, it's a\nlong  story.  But  as  soon  as  I  did  land  on  this\nplace, I soon got to know all your affairs-all, all,\nbrother,  I  know  everything;  Nastasya  here  will\ntell  you.  I  made  the  acquaintance  of  Nikodim\nFomitch  and  Ilya  Petrovitch,  and  the  house-\nporter and Mr. Zametov, Alexandr Grigorievitch,\nthe head clerk in the police office, and, last, but\nnot  least,  of  Pashenka;  Nastasya  here  1(cid:24)0\nCrime and Punishment knows....'\n'He's  got  round  her,'  Nastasya  murmured,\nsmiling slyly.", "'Why  don't  you  put  the  sugar  in  your  tea,\nNastasya Nikiforovna?'\n'You are a one!' Nastasya cried suddenly, going\noff  into  a  giggle.  'I  am  not  Nikiforovna,  but\nPetrovna,' she added suddenly, recovering from\nher mirth.\n'I'll  make  a  note  of  it.  Well,  brother,  to  make  a\nlong  story  short,  I  was  going  in  for  a  regular\nexplosion  here  to  uproot  all  malignant\ninfluences in the locality, but Pashenka won the\nday. I had not expected, brother, to find her so\n... prepossessing. Eh, what do you think?'\nRaskolnikov did not speak, but he still kept his\neyes fixed upon him, full of alarm.\n'And  all  that  could  be  wished,  indeed,  in  every\nrespect,'  Razumihin  went  on,  not  at  all\nembarrassed by his silence.\n'Ah, the sly dog!' Nastasya shrieked again. This\nconversation afforded her unspeakable delight.\n'It's a pity, brother, that you did not set to work", "in  the  right  way  at  first.  You  ought  to  have\napproached her differently. She is, so to speak,\na  most  unaccountable  character.  But  we  will\ntalk about her character later.... How could you\nlet things come to such a pass that she gave up\nsending you your dinner? And that I O U? You\nmust have been mad to sign an I O U. And that\npromise  of  marriage  when  her  daughter,\nNatalya  Yegorovna,  was  alive?  ...  I  know  all\nabout it! But I see that's a delicate matter and I\nam  an  ass;  forgive  me.  But,  talking  of\nfoolishness,  do  you  know  Praskovya  Pavlovna\nis not nearly so foolish as you would think Free\neBooks at Planet eBook.com 1(cid:24)1 at first sight?'\n'No,'  mumbled  Raskolnikov,  looking  away,  but\nfeeling  that  it  was  better  to  keep  up  the\nconversation.\n'She isn't, is she?' cried Razumihin, delighted to\nget  an  answer  out  of  him.  'But  she  is  not  very\nclever either, eh? She is essentially, essentially\nan  unaccountable  character!  I  am  sometimes\nquite  at  a  loss,  I  assure  you....  She  must  be\nforty;  she  says  she  is  thirty-  six,  and  of  course\nshe  has  every  right  to  say  so.  But  I  swear  I\njudge  her  intellectually,  simply  from  the", "metaphysical  point  of  view;  there  is  a  sort  of\nsymbolism  sprung  up  between  us,  a  sort  of\nalgebra or what not! I don't understand it! Well,\nthat's  all  nonsense.  Only,  seeing  that  you  are\nnot  a  student  now  and  have  lost  your  lessons\nand  your  clothes,  and  that  through  the  young\nlady's death she has no need to treat you as a\nrelation,  she  suddenly  took  fright;  and  as  you\nhid  in  your  den  and  dropped  all  your  old\nrelations with her, she planned to get rid of you.\nAnd  she's  been  cherishing  that  design  a  long\ntime,  but  was  sorry  to  lose  the  I  O  U,  for  you\nassured  her  yourself  that  your  mother  would\npay.'\n'It  was  base  of  me  to  say  that....  My  mother\nherself is almost a beggar ... and I told a lie to\nkeep  my  lodging  ...  and  be  fed,'  Raskolnikov\nsaid loudly and distinctly.\n'Yes, you did very sensibly. But the worst of it is\nthat  at  that  point  Mr.  Tchebarov  turns  up,  a\nbusiness  man.  Pashenka  would  never  have\nthought of doing anything on her own account,\nshe  is  too  retiring;  but  the  business  man  is  by\nno  means  retiring,  and  first  thing  he  puts  the\nquestion, 'Is there any hope of realising the I O", "U?'  Answer:  there  is,  1  because  he  has  a\nmother  who  would  save  her  Rodya  with  her\nhundred and twenty-five roubles pension, if she\nhas  to  starve  herself;  and  a  sister,  too,  who\nwould go into bondage for his sake. That's what\nhe  was  building  upon....  Why  do  you  start?  I\nknow all the ins and outs of your affairs now, my\ndear  boy-it's  not  for  nothing  that  you  were  so\nopen  with  Pashenka  when  you  were  her\nprospective  son-in-law,  and  I  say  all  this  as  a\nfriend.... But I tell you what it is; an honest and\nsensitive  man  is  open;  and  a  business  man\n'listens  and  goes  on  eating'  you  up.  Well,  then\nshe  gave  the  I  O  U  by  way  of  payment  to  this\nTchebarov,  and  without  hesitation  he  made  a\nformal demand for payment. When I heard of all\nthis  I  wanted  to  blow  him  up,  too,  to  clear  my\nconscience,  but  by  that  time  harmony  reigned\nbetween  me  and  Pashenka,  and  I  insisted  on\nstopping  the  whole  affair,  engaging  that  you\nwould  pay.  I  went  security  for  you,  brother.  Do\nyou  understand?  We  called  Tchebarov,  flung\nhim  ten  roubles  and  got  the  I  O  U  back  from\nhim, and here I have the honour of presenting it\nto you. She trusts your word now. Here, take it,\nyou see I have torn it.'", "Razumihin  put  the  note  on  the  table.\nRaskolnikov  looked  at  him  and  turned  to  the\nwall without uttering a word. Even \nRazumihin felt a twinge.\n'I  see,  brother,'  he  said  a  moment  later,  'that  I\nhave  been  playing  the  fool  again.  I  thought  I\nshould  amuse  you  with  my  chatter,  and  I\nbelieve I have only made you cross.'\n'Was  it  you  I  did  not  recognise  when  I  was\ndelirious?' Raskolnikov asked, after a moment's\npause without turning his head.Free eBooks at\nPlanet eBook.com 1(cid:24)(cid:24) 'Yes, and you flew into a\nrage  about  it,  especially  when  I  brought\nZametov one day.'\n'Zametov?    The    head    clerk?    What    for?' \nRaskolnikov  turned  round  quickly  and  fixed  his\neyes on Razumihin.\n'What's  the  matter  with  you?  ...  What  are  you\nupset  about?  He  wanted  to  make  your\nacquaintance  because  I  talked  to  him  a  lot\nabout  you....  How  could  I  have  found  out  so\nmuch  except  from  him?  He  is  a  capital  fellow,", "brother,  first-rate  ...  in  his  own  way,  of  course.\nNow  we  are  friends-see  each  other  almost\nevery  day.  I  have  moved  into  this  part,  you\nknow.  I  have  only  just  moved.  I've  been  with\nhim to Luise Ivanovna once or twice.... Do you\nremember Luise, Luise Ivanovna?\n'Did I say anything in delirium?'\n'I should think so! You were beside yourself.'\n'What did I rave about?'\n'What  next?  What  did  you  rave  about?  What\npeople  do  rave  about....  Well,  brother,  now  I\nmust not lose time. To work.' He got up from the\ntable and took up his cap.\n'What did I rave about?'\n'How he keeps on! Are you afraid of having let\nout some secret? Don't worry yourself; you said\nnothing  about  a  countess.  But  you  said  a  lot\nabout a bulldog, and about earrings and chains,\nand about Krestovsky Island, and some porter,\nand  Nikodim  Fomitch  and  Ilya  Petrovitch,  the\nassistant superintendent. And another thing that", "was  of  special  interest  to  you  was  your  own\nsock. You whined, 'Give me my sock.' Zametov\nhunted all about your room for your socks, and\nwith his own scented, ring-bedecked fingers he\n1  gave  you  the  rag.  And  only  then  were  you\ncomforted,  and  for  the  next  twenty-four  hours\nyou  held  the  wretched  thing  in  your  hand;  we\ncould  not  get  it  from  you.  It  is  most  likely\nsomewhere  under  your  quilt  at  this  moment.\nAnd  then  you  asked  so  piteously  for  fringe  for\nyour  trousers.  We  tried  to  find  out  what  sort  of\nfringe,  but  we  could  not  make  it  out.  Now  to\nbusiness! Here are thirty-five roubles; I take ten\nof them, and shall give you an account of them\nin an hour or two. I will let Zossimov know at the\nsame time, though he ought to have been here\nlong  ago,  for  it  is  nearly  twelve.  And  you,\nNastasya, look in pretty often while I am away,\nto  see  whether  he  wants  a  drink  or  anything\nelse.  And  I  will  tell  Pashenka  what  is  wanted\nmyself. Good-bye!'\n'He  calls  her  Pashenka!  Ah,  he's  a  deep  one!'\nsaid Nastasya as he went out; then she opened\nthe door and stood listening, but could not resist\nrunning  downstairs  after  him.  She  was  very\neager  to  hear  what  he  would  say  to  the", "landlady. She was evidently quite fascinated by\nRazumihin.\nNo  sooner  had  she  left  the  room  than  the  sick\nman  flung  off  the  bedclothes  and  leapt  out  of\nbed  like  a  madman.  With  burning,  twitching\nimpatience  he  had  waited  for  them  to  be  gone\nso that he might set to work. But to what work?\nNow, as though to spite him, it eluded him.\n'Good God, only tell me one thing: do they know\nof  it  yet  or  not?  What  if  they  know  it  and  are\nonly pretending, mocking me while I am laid up,\nand  then  they  will  come  in  and  tell  me  that  it's\nbeen  discovered  long  ago  and  that  they  have\nonly  ...

That's  what  I've\nforgotten, as though on purpose; forgotten it all\nat once, I Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 1(cid:24)(cid:24)\nremembered a minute ago.'\nHe stood in the middle of the room and gazed in\nmiserable  bewilderment  about  him;  he  walked\nto the door, opened it, listened; but that was not\nwhat he wanted. Suddenly, as though recalling\nsomething, he rushed to the corner where there\nwas  a  hole  under  the  paper,  began  examining\nit,  put  his  hand  into  the  hole,  fumbled-but  that", "was not it. He went to the stove, opened it and\nbegan  rummaging  in  the  ashes;  the  frayed\nedges  of  his  trousers  and  the  rags  cut  off  his\npocket  were  lying  there  just  as  he  had  thrown\nthem.  No  one  had  looked,  then!  Then  he\nremembered  the  sock  about  which  Razumihin\nhad just been telling him. Yes, there it lay on the\nsofa under the quilt, but it was so covered with\ndust  and  grime  that  Zametov  could  not  have\nseen anything on it.\n'Bah, Zametov! The police office! And why am I\nsent for to the police office? Where's the notice?\nBah! I am mixing it up; that was then. I looked at\nmy sock then, too, but now ... now I have been\nill.  But  what  did  Zametov  come  for?  Why  did\nRazumihin  bring  him?'  he  muttered,  helplessly\nsitting  on  the  sofa  again.  'What  does  it  mean?\nAm I still in delirium, or is it real? I believe it is\nreal....  Ah,  I  remember;  I  must  escape!  Make\nhaste  to  escape.  Yes,  I  must,  I  must  escape!\nYes ... but where? And where are my clothes?\nI've  no  boots.

If  only  I  could  get\ndownstairs!  And  what  if  they  have  set  a  watch\nthere-policemen! What's this tea? Ah, and here\nis beer left, half a bottle, cold!'\nHe snatched up the bottle, which still contained\na  glassful  of  beer,  and  gulped  it  down  with\nrelish,  as  though  quenching  a  flame  in  his\nbreast. But in another minute the beer had gone\nto  his  head,  and  a  faint  and  even  pleasant\nshiver  ran  down  his  spine.  He  lay  down  and\npulled  the  quilt  over  him.  His  sick  and\nincoherent  thoughts  grew  more  and  more\ndisconnected,  and  soon  a  light,  pleasant\ndrowsiness  came  upon  him.  With  a  sense  of\ncomfort  he  nestled  his  head  into  the  pillow,\nwrapped  more  closely  about  him  the  soft,\nwadded  quilt  which  had  replaced  the  old,\nragged greatcoat, sighed softly and sank into a", "deep, sound, refreshing sleep.\nHe  woke  up,  hearing  someone  come  in.  He\nopened  his  eyes  and  saw  Razumihin  standing\nin the doorway, uncertain whether to come in or\nnot. Raskolnikov sat up quickly on the sofa and\ngazed  at  him,  as  though  trying  to  recall\nsomething.\n'Ah,  you  are  not  asleep!  Here  I  am!  Nastasya,\nbring  in  the  parcel!'  Razumihin  shouted  down\nthe stairs.

Don't\nyou remember?'\nRaskolnikov  pondered.  The  morning  seemed \nlike    a  dream  to  him.

And  the  next  day  I  heard  that\nsomeone  had  murdered  Alyona  Ivanovna  and\nher  sister,  Lizaveta  Ivanovna,  with  an  axe.

I  went  to  the\nhouse,  and  began  to  make  careful  inquiries\nwithout  saying  a  word  to  anyone.  First  of  all  I\nasked,  'Is  Nikolay  here?'

'I found them in the street,' and the way\nhe said it was a bit queer; he did not look at me.\n'Did you hear what happened that very evening,\nat that very hour, on that same staircase?' said\nI.  'No,'  said  he,  'I  had  not  heard,'  and  all  the\nwhile he was listening, his eyes were staring out\nof  his  head  and  he  turned  as  white  as  chalk.  I\ntold  him  all  about  it  and  he  took  his  hat  and\nbegan getting up. I wanted to keep him. 'Wait a\nbit,  Nikolay,'  said  I,  'won't  you  have  a  drink?'", "And I signed to the boy to hold the door, and I\ncame out from behind the bar; but he darted out\nand  down  the  street  to  the  turning  at  a  run.

And the day before yesterday\nthey  arrested  Nikolay  in  a  tavern  at  the  end  of\nthe  town.  He  had  gone  there,  taken  the  silver\ncross  off  his  neck  and  asked  for  a  dram  for  it.\nThey  gave  it  to  him.

'How  could  you  be  frightened,  if  you\nfelt  free  from  guilt?'  Now,  Zossimov,  you  may\nnot believe me, that question was put literally in\nthose words.

What do you say to that?'\n'Well, anyway, there's the evidence.'", "'I  am  not  talking  of  the  evidence  now,  I  am\ntalking about that question, of their own idea of\nthemselves.  Well,  so  they  squeezed  and\nsqueezed him and he confessed: 'I did not find\nit  in  the  street,  but  in  the  flat  where  I  was\npainting with Dmitri.' 'And how was that?' 'Why,\nDmitri and I were painting there all day, and we\nwere just getting ready to go, and Dmitri took a\nbrush and painted my face, and he ran off and I\nafter him. I ran after him, shouting my hardest,\nand at the bottom of the stairs I ran right against\nthe porter and some gentlemen-and how many\ngentlemen  were  there  I  don't  remember.  And\nthe  porter  swore  at  me,  and  the  other  porter\nswore, too, and the porter's wife came out, and\nswore  at  us,  too;  and  a  gentleman  came  into\nthe entry with a lady, and he swore at us, too,\nfor  Dmitri  and  I  lay  right  across  the  way.  I  got\nhold of Dmitri's hair and knocked him down and\nbegan beating him. And Dmitri, too, caught me\nby the hair and began beating me. But we did it\nall not for temper but in a friendly way, for sport.\nAnd then Dmitri escaped and ran into the street,\nand I ran after him; but I did not catch him, and\nwent back to the flat alone; I had to clear up my\nthings. I began putting them together, expecting", "Dmitri to come, and there in the passage, in the\ncorner by the door, I (cid:24)0(cid:24) Crime and Punishment\nstepped on the box. I saw it lying there wrapped\nup in paper. I took off the paper, saw some little\nhooks,  undid  them,  and  in  the  box  were  the\near-rings....''\n'Behind  the  door?  Lying  behind  the  door?\nBehind  the  door?'  Raskolnikov  cried  suddenly,\nstaring with a blank look of terror at Razumihin,\nand he slowly sat up on the sofa, leaning on his\nhand.\n'Yes  ...  why?  What's  the  matter?  What's\nwrong?' Razumihin, too, got up from his seat.\n'Nothing,' Raskolnikov answered faintly, turning\nto the wall. All were silent for a while.\n'He must have waked from a dream,' Razumihin\nsaid at last, looking inquiringly at Zossimov. The\nlatter slightly shook his head.\n'Well, go on,' said Zossimov. 'What next?'\n'What  next?  As  soon  as  he  saw  the  ear-rings,\nforgetting Dmitri and everything, he took up his", "cap and ran to Dushkin and, as we know, got a\nrouble  from  him.  He  told  a  lie  saying  he  found\nthem  in  the  street,  and  went  off  drinking.  He\nkeeps repeating his old story about the murder:\n'I know nothing of it, never heard of it till the day\nbefore yesterday.' 'And why didn't you come to\nthe police till now?' 'I was frightened.' 'And why\ndid  you  try  to  hang  yourself?'  'From  anxiety.'\n'What anxiety?' 'That I should be accused of it.'\nWell,  that's  the  whole  story.  And  now  what  do\nyou suppose they deduced from that?'\n'Why,  there's  no  supposing.  There's  a  clue,\nsuch  as  it  is,  a  fact.  You  wouldn't  have  your\npainter set free?'\n'Now they've simply taken him for the murderer.\nThey 0(cid:24) haven't a shadow of doubt.'\n'That's  nonsense.  You  are  excited.  But  what\nabout the ear-rings? You must admit that, if on\nthe very same day and hour ear-rings from the\nold  woman's  box  have  come  into  Nikolay's\nhands,  they  must  have  come  there  somehow.\nThat's a good deal in such a case.'\n'How  did  they  get  there?  How  did  they  get", "there?'  cried  Razumihin.  'How  can  you,  a\ndoctor,  whose  duty  it  is  to  study  man  and  who\nhas  more  opportunity  than  anyone  else  for\nstudying human nature-how can you fail to see\nthe  character  of  the  man  in  the  whole  story?\nDon't you see at once that the answers he has\ngiven  in  the  examination  are  the  holy  truth?\nThey  came  into  his  hand  precisely  as  he  has\ntold us-he stepped on the box and picked it up.'\n'The holy truth! But didn't he own himself that he\ntold a lie at first?'\n'Listen  to  me,  listen  attentively.  The  porter  and\nKoch  and  Pestryakov  and  the  other  porter  and\nthe  wife  of  the  first  porter  and  the  woman  who\nwas  sitting  in  the  porter's  lodge  and  the  man\nKryukov,  who  had  just  got  out  of  a  cab  at  that\nminute  and  went  in  at  the  entry  with  a  lady  on\nhis  arm,  that  is  eight  or  ten  witnesses,  agree\nthat Nikolay had Dmitri on the ground, was lying\non him beating him, while Dmitri hung on to his\nhair, beating him, too. They lay right across the\nway,  blocking  the  thoroughfare.  They  were\nsworn  at  on  all  sides  while  they  'like  children'\n(the  very  words  of  the  witnesses)  were  falling\nover  one  another,  squealing,  fighting  and", "laughing  with  the  funniest  faces,  and,  chasing\none  another  like  children,  they  ran  into  the\nstreet.  Now  take  (cid:24)0(cid:24)  Crime  and  Punishment\ncareful  note.  The  bodies  upstairs  were  warm,\nyou understand, warm when they found them! If\nthey, or Nikolay alone, had murdered them and\nbroken open the boxes, or simply taken part in\nthe robbery, allow me to ask you one question:\ndo their state of mind, their squeals and giggles\nand childish scuffling at the gate fit in with axes,\nbloodshed,  fiendish  cunning,  robbery?  They'd\njust killed them, not five or ten minutes before,\nfor  the  bodies  were  still  warm,  and  at  once,\nleaving the flat open, knowing that people would\ngo there at once, flinging away their booty, they\nrolled  about  like  children,  laughing  and\nattracting  general  attention.  And  there  are  a\ndozen witnesses to swear to that!'\n'Of course it is strange! It's impossible, indeed,\nbut ...'\n'No, brother, no buts. And if the ear-rings being\nfound  in  Nikolay's  hands  at  the  very  day  and\nhour  of  the  murder  constitutes  an  important\npiece  of  circumstantial  evidence  against\nhim-although  the  explanation  given  by  him", "accounts  for  it,  and  therefore  it  does  not  tell\nseriously  against  him-one  must  take  into\nconsideration  the  facts  which  prove  him\ninnocent,  especially  as  they  are  facts  that\ncannot  be  denied.  And  do  you  suppose,  from\nthe character of our legal system, that they will\naccept, or that they are in a position to accept,\nthis  fact-  resting  simply  on  a  psychological\nimpossibility-as    irrefutable    and    conclusively \nbreaking  down  the  circumstantial  evidence  for\nthe  prosecution?  No,  they  won't  accept  it,  they\ncertainly  won't,  because  they  found  the\njewel-case  and  the  man  tried  to  hang  himself,\n'which  he  could  not  have  done  if  he  hadn't  felt\nguilty.' That's the point, that's what excites me,\nyou  must  understand!'0(cid:24)  'Oh,  I  see  you  are\nexcited!  Wait  a  bit.  I  forgot  to  ask  you;  what\nproof  is  there  that  the  box  came  from  the  old\nwoman?'\n'That's  been  proved,'  said  Razumihin  with\napparent  reluctance,  frowning.  'Koch\nrecognised  the  jewel-case  and  gave  the  name\nof  the  owner,  who  proved  conclusively  that  it\nwas his.'\n'That's bad. Now another point. Did anyone see", "Nikolay  at  the  time  that  Koch  and  Pestryakov\nwere  going  upstairs  at  first,  and  is  there  no\nevidence about that?'\n'Nobody did see him,' Razumihin answered with\nvexation. 'That's the worst of it. Even Koch and\nPestryakov  did  not  notice  them  on  their  way\nupstairs,  though,  indeed,  their  evidence  could\nnot have been worth much. They said they saw\nthe flat was open, and that there must be work\ngoing  on  in  it,  but  they  took  no  special  notice\nand could not remember whether there actually\nwere men at work in it.'\n'Hm! ... So the only evidence for the defence is\nthat  they  were  beating  one  another  and\nlaughing.  That  constitutes  a  strong\npresumption,  but  ...  How  do  you  explain  the\nfacts yourself?'\n'How  do  I  explain  them?  What  is  there  to\nexplain?  It's  clear.  At  any  rate,  the  direction  in\nwhich explanation is to be sought is clear, and\nthe  jewel-case  points  to  it.  The  real  murderer\ndropped  those  ear-  rings.  The  murderer  was\nupstairs, locked in, when Koch and Pestryakov\nknocked at the door. Koch, like an ass, did not", "stay  at  the  door;  so  the  murderer  popped  out\nand ran down, too; for he had no other way of\nescape. He hid from Koch, Pestryakov and the\npor(cid:24)0(cid:24)  Crime  and  Punishment  ter  in  the  flat\nwhen  Nikolay  and  Dmitri  had  just  run  out  of  it.\nHe  stopped  there  while  the  porter  and  others\nwere going upstairs, waited till they were out of\nhearing, and then went calmly downstairs at the\nvery  minute  when  Dmitri  and  Nikolay  ran  out\ninto  the  street  and  there  was  no  one  in  the\nentry;  possibly  he  was  seen,  but  not  noticed.\nThere  are  lots  of  people  going  in  and  out.  He\nmust  have  dropped  the  ear-rings  out  of  his\npocket when he stood behind the door, and did\nnot  notice  he  dropped  them,  because  he  had\nother  things  to  think  of.  The  jewel-case  is  a\nconclusive  proof  that  he  did  stand  there....\nThat's how I explain it.'\n'Too clever! No, my boy, you're too clever. That\nbeats everything.'\n'But, why, why?'\n'Why, because everything fits too well ... it's too\nmelodramatic.'", "'A-ach!'  Razumihin  was  exclaiming,  but  at  that\nmoment  the  door  opened  and  a  personage\ncame in who was a stranger to all present.0(cid:24) ", "#$#$Chapter 13#$#$\nThis was a gentleman no longer young, of a stiff\nand portly appearance, and a cautious and sour\ncountenance. He began by stopping short in the\ndoorway,  staring  about  him  with  offensive  and\nundisguised  astonishment,  as  though  asking\nhimself  what  sort  of  place  he  had  come  to.\nMistrustfully  and  with  an  affectation  of  being\nalarmed  and  almost  affronted,  he  scanned\nRaskolnikov's  low  and  narrow  'cabin.'  With  the\nsame  amazement  he  stared  at  Raskolnikov,\nwho  lay  undressed,  dishevelled,  unwashed,  on\nhis  miserable  dirty  sofa,  looking  fixedly  at  him.\nThen with the same deliberation he scrutinised\nthe uncouth, unkempt figure and unshaven face\nof  Razumihin,  who  looked  him  boldly  and\ninquiringly  in  the  face  without  rising  from  his\nseat.  A  constrained  silence  lasted  for  a  couple\nof  minutes,  and  then,  as  might  be  expected,\nsome  scene-shifting  took  place.  Reflecting,\nprobably from certain fairly unmistakable signs,\nthat  he  would  get  nothing  in  this  'cabin'  by\nattempting  to  overawe  them,  the  gentleman\nsoftened  somewhat,  and  civilly,  though  with", "some  severity,  emphasising  every  syllable  of\nhis question, addressed Zossimov:\n'Rodion Romanovitch Raskolnikov, a student, or\nformerly a student?'\nZossimov  made  a  slight  movement,  and  would\nhave answered, had not Razumihin anticipated\nhim.(cid:24)0(cid:24) Crime and Punishment 'Here he is lying\non the sofa! What do you want?'\nThis familiar 'what do you want' seemed to cut\nthe  ground  from  the  feet  of  the  pompous\ngentleman.  He  was  turning  to  Razumihin,  but\nchecked himself in time and turned to Zossimov\nagain.\n'This  is  Raskolnikov,'  mumbled  Zossimov,\nnodding  towards  him.  Then  he  gave  a\nprolonged yawn, opening his mouth as wide as\npossible.  Then  he  lazily  put  his  hand  into  his\nwaistcoat-pocket, pulled out a huge gold watch\nin a round hunter's case, opened it, looked at it\nand  as  slowly  and  lazily  proceeded  to  put  it\nback.\nRaskolnikov  himself  lay  without  speaking,  on", "his back, gazing  persistently,  though  without \nunderstanding,    at  the  stranger.  Now  that  his\nface  was  turned  away  from  the  strange  flower\non the paper, it was extremely pale and wore a\nlook  of  anguish,  as  though  he  had  just\nundergone an agonising operation or just been\ntaken  from  the  rack.  But  the  new-comer\ngradually began to arouse his attention, then his\nwonder,  then  suspicion  and  even  alarm.  When\nZossimov  said  'This  is  Raskolnikov'  he  jumped\nup  quickly,  sat  on  the  sofa  and  with  an  almost\ndefiant,  but  weak  and  breaking,  voice\narticulated:\n'Yes, I am Raskolnikov! What do you want?'\nThe  visitor  scrutinised  him  and  pronounced\nimpressively:\n'Pyotr Petrovitch Luzhin. I believe I have reason\nto hope that my name is not wholly unknown to\nyou?'But  Raskolnikov,  who  had  expected\nsomething  quite  different,  gazed  blankly  and\ndreamily at him, making no reply, 0(cid:24) as though\nhe  heard  the  name  of  Pyotr  Petrovitch  for  the\nfirst time.", "'Is  it  possible  that  you  can  up  to  the  present\nhave  received  no  information?'  asked  Pyotr\nPetrovitch, somewhat disconcerted.\nIn reply Raskolnikov sank languidly back on the\npillow, put his hands behind his head and gazed\nat  the  ceiling.  A  look  of  dismay  came  into\nLuzhin's  face.  Zossimov  and  Razumihin  stared\nat  him  more  inquisitively  than  ever,  and  at  last\nhe  showed  unmistakable  signs  of\nembarrassment.\n'I  had  presumed  and  calculated,'  he  faltered,\n'that a letter posted more than ten days, if not a\nfortnight ago ...'\n'I  say,  why  are  you  standing  in  the  doorway?'\nRazumihin  interrupted  suddenly.  'If  you've\nsomething  to  say,  sit  down.  Nastasya  and  you\nare  so  crowded.  Nastasya,  make  room.  Here's\na chair, thread your way in!'\nHe moved his chair back from the table, made a\nlittle  space  between  the  table  and  his  knees,\nand waited in a rather cramped position for the\nvisitor to 'thread his way in.' The minute was so\nchosen that it was impossible to refuse, and the", "visitor squeezed his way through, hurrying and\nstumbling.  Reaching  the  chair,  he  sat  down,\nlooking suspiciously at Razumihin.\n'No  need  to  be  nervous,'  the  latter  blurted  out.\n'Rodya  has  been  ill  for  the  last  five  days  and\ndelirious for three, but now he is recovering and\nhas got an appetite. This is his doctor, who has\njust  had  a  look  at  him.  I  am  a  comrade  of\nRodya's, like him, formerly a student, and now I\nam nursing him; so don't you take any notice of\nus,  but  go  on  with  (cid:24)10  Crime  and  Punishment\nyour business.'\n'Thank you. But shall I not disturb the invalid by\nmy  presence  and  conversation?'  Pyotr\nPetrovitch asked of Zossimov.\n'N-no,'  mumbled  Zossimov;  'you  may  amuse\nhim.' He yawned again.\n'He  has  been  conscious  a  long  time,  since  the\nmorning,' went on Razumihin, whose familiarity\nseemed  so  much  like  unaffected  good-  nature\nthat Pyotr Petrovitch began to be more cheerful,\npartly,  perhaps,  because  this  shabby  and\nimpudent  person  had  introduced  himself  as  a", "student.\n'Your mamma,' began Luzhin.'Hm!'  Razumihin \ncleared    his    throat    loudly.    Luzhin  looked  at\nhim inquiringly.\n'That's all right, go on.'\nLuzhin shrugged his shoulders.\n'Your  mamma  had  commenced  a  letter  to  you\nwhile  I  was  sojourning  in  her  neighbourhood.\nOn  my  arrival  here  I  purposely  allowed  a  few\ndays  to  elapse  before  coming  to  see  you,  in\norder that I might be fully assured that you were\nin full possession of the tidings; but now, to my\nastonishment ...'\n'I  know,  I  know!'  Raskolnikov  cried  suddenly\nwith impatient vexation. 'So you are the fiancé?\nI know, and that's enough!'\nThere  was  no  doubt  about  Pyotr  Petrovitch's\nbeing  offended  this  time,  but  he  said  nothing.\nHe  made  a  violent  effort  to  understand  what  it\nall  meant.  There  was  a  moment's  silence.11\nMeanwhile Raskolnikov, who had turned a little", "towards  him  when  he  answered,  began\nsuddenly  staring  at  him  again  with  marked\ncuriosity, as though he had not had a good look\nat  him  yet,  or  as  though  something  new  had\nstruck  him;  he  rose  from  his  pillow  on  purpose\nto  stare  at  him.  There  certainly  was  something\npeculiar in Pyotr Petrovitch's whole appearance,\nsomething  which  seemed  to  justify  the  title  of\n'fiancé'  so  unceremoniously  applied  to  him.  In\nthe  first  place,  it  was  evident,  far  too  much  so\nindeed,  that  Pyotr  Petrovitch  had  made  eager\nuse of his few days in the capital to get himself\nup  and  rig  himself  out  in  expectation  of  his\nbetrothed-a  perfectly  innocent  and  permissible\nproceeding, indeed. Even his own, perhaps too\ncomplacent,  consciousness  of  the  agreeable\nimprovement  in  his  appearance  might  have\nbeen  forgiven  in  such  circumstances,  seeing\nthat  Pyotr  Petrovitch  had  taken  up  the  rôle  of\nfiancé.  All  his  clothes  were  fresh  from  the\ntailor's  and  were  all  right,  except  for  being  too\nnew  and  too  distinctly  appropriate.  Even  the\nstylish  new  round  hat  had  the  same\nsignificance.  Pyotr  Petrovitch  treated  it  too\nrespectfully  and  held  it  too  carefully  in  his\nhands.  The  exquisite  pair  of  lavender  gloves,\nreal Louvain, told the same tale, if only from the", "fact of his not wearing them, but carrying them\nin his hand for show. Light and youthful colours\npredominated  in  Pyotr  Petrovitch's  attire.  He\nwore  a  charming  summer  jacket  of  a  fawn\nshade,  light  thin  trousers,  a  waistcoat  of  the\nsame,  new  and  fine  linen,  a  cravat  of  the\nlightest cambric with pink stripes on it, and the\nbest  of  it  was,  this  all  suited  Pyotr  Petrovitch.\nHis very fresh and even handsome face looked\nyounger  than  his  for(cid:24)1(cid:24)  Crime  and  Punishment\nty-five years at all times. His dark, mutton-chop\nwhiskers  made  an  agreeable  setting  on  both\nsides,  growing  thickly  upon  his  shining,\nclean-shaven chin. Even his hair, touched here\nand there with grey, though it had been combed\nand curled at a hairdresser's, did not give him a\nstupid appearance, as curled hair usually does,\nby  inevitably  suggesting  a  German  on  his\nwedding-day.  If  there  really  was  something\nunpleasing  and  repulsive  in  his  rather\ngood-looking and imposing countenance, it was\ndue  to  quite  other  causes.  After  scanning  Mr.\nLuzhin  unceremoniously,  Raskolnikov  smiled\nmalignantly, sank back on the pillow and stared\nat the ceiling as before.\nBut Mr. Luzhin hardened his heart and seemed", "to determine to take no notice of their oddities.\n'I  feel  the  greatest  regret  at  finding  you  in  this\nsituation,' he began, again breaking the silence\nwith  an  effort.  'If  I  had  been  aware  of  your\nillness  I  should  have  come  earlier.  But  you\nknow  what  business  is.  I  have,  too,  a  very\nimportant  legal  affair  in  the  Senate,  not  to\nmention  other  preoccupations  which  you  may\nwell  conjecture.  I  am  expecting  your  mamma\nand sister any minute.'\nRaskolnikov  made  a  movement  and  seemed\nabout  to  speak;  his  face  showed  some\nexcitement.  Pyotr  Petrovitch  paused,  waited,\nbut as nothing followed, he went on:\n'... Any minute. I have found a lodging for them\non their arrival.'\n'Where?' asked Raskolnikov weakly.\n'Very near here, in Bakaleyev's house.'\n'That's  in  Voskresensky,'  put  in  Razumihin.\n'There  are  1(cid:24)  two  storeys  of  rooms,  let  by  a\nmerchant called Yushin; I've been there.'", "'Yes, rooms ...'\n'A  disgusting  place-filthy,  stinking  and,  what's\nmore,  of  doubtful  character.  Things  have\nhappened there, and there are all sorts of queer\npeople  living  there.  And  I  went  there  about  a\nscandalous business. It's cheap, though ...'\n'I could not, of course, find out so much about it,\nfor I am a stranger in Petersburg myself,' Pyotr\nPetrovitch  replied  huffily.  'However,  the  two\nrooms are exceedingly clean, and as it is for so\nshort  a  time  ...  I  have  already  taken  a\npermanent,  that  is,  our  future  flat,'  he  said,\naddressing  Raskolnikov,  'and  I  am  having  it\ndone up. And meanwhile I am myself cramped\nfor  room  in  a  lodging  with  my  friend  Andrey\nSemyonovitch  Lebeziatnikov,  in  the  flat  of\nMadame Lippevechsel; it was he who told me of\nBakaleyev's house, too ...'\n'Lebeziatnikov?'  said  Raskolnikov  slowly,  as  if\nrecalling something.\n'Yes,  Andrey  Semyonovitch  Lebeziatnikov,  a\nclerk in the Ministry. Do you know him?'", "'Yes ... no,' Raskolnikov answered.\n'Excuse  me,  I  fancied  so  from  your  inquiry.  I\nwas  once  his  guardian....  A  very  nice  young\nman and advanced. I like to meet young people:\none  learns  new  things  from  them.'  Luzhin\nlooked round hopefully at them all.\n'How do you mean?' asked Razumihin.\n'In  the  most  serious  and  essential  matters,'\nPyotr Petrovitch replied, as though delighted at\nthe  question.  'You  see,  (cid:24)1(cid:24)  Crime  and\nPunishment  it's  ten  years  since  I  visited\nPetersburg.  All  the  novelties,  reforms,  ideas\nhave reached us in the provinces, but to see it\nall more clearly one must be in Petersburg. And\nit's my notion that you observe and learn most\nby  watching  the  younger  generation.  And  I\nconfess I am delighted ...'\n'At what?'\n'Your  question  is  a  wide  one.  I  may  be\nmistaken, but I fancy I find clearer views, more,\nso to say, criticism, more practicality ...'", "'That's true,' Zossimov let drop.\n'Nonsense!  There's  no  practicality.'  Razumihin\nflew at him. 'Practicality is a difficult thing to find;\nit does not drop down from heaven. And for the\nlast two hundred years we have been divorced\nfrom  all  practical  life.  Ideas,  if  you  like,  are\nfermenting,'  he  said  to  Pyotr  Petrovitch,  'and\ndesire  for  good  exists,  though  it's  in  a  childish\nform, and honesty you may find, although there\nare  crowds  of  brigands.  Anyway,  there's  no\npracticality. Practicality goes well shod.'\n'I don't agree with you,' Pyotr Petrovitch replied,\nwith  evident  enjoyment.  'Of  course,  people  do\nget  carried  away  and  make  mistakes,  but  one\nmust  have  indulgence;  those  mistakes  are\nmerely  evidence  of  enthusiasm  for  the  cause\nand  of  abnormal  external  environment.  If  little\nhas been done, the time has been but short; of\nmeans I will not speak. It's my personal view, if\nyou  care  to  know,  that  something  has  been\naccomplished already. New valuable ideas, new\nvaluable  works  are  circulating  in  the  place  of\nour old dreamy and romantic authors. Literature\nis  taking  a  maturer  form,  many  injurious", "prejudice  have  been  rooted  up  and  turned  1(cid:24)\ninto ridicule.... In a word, we have cut ourselves\noff  irrevocably  from  the  past,  and  that,  to  my\nthinking, is a great thing ...'\n'He's learnt it by heart to show off!' Raskolnikov\npronounced suddenly.\n'What?' asked Pyotr Petrovitch, not catching his\nwords; but he received no reply.\n'That's  all  true,'  Zossimov  hastened  to\ninterpose.\n'Isn't  it  so?'  Pyotr  Petrovitch  went  on,  glancing\naffably at Zossimov. 'You must admit,' he went\non,  addressing  Razumihin  with  a  shade  of\ntriumph  and  superciliousness-he  almost  added\n'young  man'-'that  there  is  an  advance,  or,  as\nthey say now, progress in the name of science\nand economic truth ...'\n'A commonplace.'\n'No, not a commonplace! Hitherto, for instance,\nif I were told, 'love thy neighbour,' what came of\nit?'  Pyotr  Petrovitch  went  on,  perhaps  with", "excessive haste. 'It came to my tearing my coat\nin half to share with my neighbour and we both\nwere left half naked. As a Russian proverb has\nit,  'Catch  several  hares  and  you  won't  catch\none.' Science now tells us, love yourself before\nall  men,  for  everything  in  the  world  rests  on\nself-interest.  You  love  yourself  and  manage\nyour own affairs properly and your coat remains\nwhole.  Economic  truth  adds  that  the  better\nprivate affairs are organised in society-the more\nwhole  coats,  so  to  say-the  firmer  are  its\nfoundations  and  the  better  is  the  common\nwelfare  organised  too.  Therefore,  in  acquiring\nwealth  solely  and  exclusively  for  myself,  I  am\nacquiring, so to speak, for all, and helping to (cid:24)1(cid:24)\nCrime  and  Punishment  bring  to  pass  my\nneighbour's  getting  a  little  more  than  a  torn\ncoat;  and  that  not  from  private,  personal\nliberality,  but  as  a  consequence  of  the  general\nadvance.  The  idea  is  simple,  but  unhappily  it\nhas  been  a  long  time  reaching  us,  being\nhindered  by  idealism  and  sentimentality.  And\nyet  it  would  seem  to  want  very  little  wit  to\nperceive it ...'\n'Excuse  me,  I've  very  little  wit  myself,'\nRazumihin cut in sharply, 'and so let us drop it. I", "began  this  discussion  with  an  object,  but  I've\ngrown so sick during the last three years of this\nchattering  to  amuse  oneself,  of  this  incessant\nflow  of  commonplaces,  always  the  same,  that,\nby  Jove,  I  blush  even  when  other  people  talk\nlike that. You are in a hurry, no doubt, to exhibit\nyour acquirements; and I don't blame you, that's\nquite pardonable. I only wanted to find out what\nsort of man you are, for so many unscrupulous\npeople  have  got  hold  of  the  progressive  cause\nof  late  and  have  so  distorted  in  their  own\ninterests  everything  they  touched,  that  the\nwhole  cause  has  been  dragged  in  the  mire.\nThat's enough!'\n'Excuse  me,  sir,'  said  Luzhin,  affronted,  and\nspeaking  with  excessive  dignity.  'Do  you  mean\nto suggest so unceremoniously that I too ...'\n'Oh, my dear sir ... how could I? ... Come, that's\nenough,'  Razumihin  concluded,  and  he  turned\nabruptly to Zossimov to continue their previous\nconversation.\nPyotr  Petrovitch  had  the  good  sense  to  accept\nthe  disavowal.  He  made  up  his  mind  to  take\nleave in another minute or two.", "'I  trust  our  acquaintance,'  he  said,  addressing\nRaskolnikov,  'may,  upon  your  recovery  and  in\nview  of  the  circumstances  1(cid:24)  of  which  you  are\naware,  become  closer  ...  Above  all,  I  hope  for\nyour return to health ...'\nRaskolnikov  did  not  even  turn  his  head.  Pyotr\nPetrovitch began getting up from his chair.\n'One  of  her  customers  must  have  killed  her,'\nZossimov declared positively.\n'Not  a  doubt  of  it,'  replied  Razumihin.  'Porfiry\ndoesn't  give  his  opinion,  but  is  examining  all\nwho have left pledges with her there.'\n'Examining them?' Raskolnikov asked aloud.\n'Yes. What then?'\n'Nothing.'\n'How  does  he  get  hold  of  them?'  asked\nZossimov.\n'Koch  has  given  the  names  of  some  of  them,", "other names are on the wrappers of the pledges\nand some have come forward of themselves.'\n'It  must  have  been  a  cunning  and  practised\nruffian! The boldness of it! The coolness!'\n'That's  just  what  it  wasn't!'  interposed\nRazumihin.  'That's  what  throws  you  all  off  the\nscent. But I maintain that he is not cunning, not\npractised, and probably this was his first crime!\nThe  supposition  that  it  was  a  calculated  crime\nand  a  cunning  criminal  doesn't  work.  Suppose\nhim  to  have  been  inexperienced,  and  it's  clear\nthat  it  was  only  a  chance  that  saved  him-and\nchance  may  do  anything.  Why,  he  did  not\nforesee obstacles, perhaps! And how did he set\nto  work?  He  took  jewels  worth  ten  or  twenty\nroubles,  stuffing  his  pockets  with  them,\nransacked the old woman's trunks, her rags-and\nthey  found  fifteen  hundred  roubles,  besides\nnotes, in (cid:24)1(cid:24) Crime and Punishment a box in the\ntop drawer of the chest! He did not know how to\nrob; he could only murder. It was his first crime,\nI  assure  you,  his  first  crime;  he  lost  his  head.\nAnd he got off more by luck than good counsel!'\n'You  are  talking  of  the  murder  of  the  old", "pawnbroker,  I  believe?'  Pyotr  Petrovitch  put  in,\naddressing Zossimov. He was standing, hat and\ngloves  in  hand,  but  before  departing  he  felt\ndisposed  to  throw  off  a  few  more  intellectual\nphrases.  He  was  evidently  anxious  to  make  a\nfavourable impression and his vanity overcame\nhis prudence.\n'Yes. You've heard of it?'\n'Oh, yes, being in the neighbourhood.'\n'Do you know the details?'\n'I  can't  say  that;  but  another  circumstance\ninterests me in the case- the whole question, so\nto  say.  Not  to  speak  of  the  fact  that  crime  has\nbeen  greatly  on  the  increase  among  the  lower\nclasses during the last five years, not to speak\nof the cases of robbery and arson everywhere,\nwhat strikes me as the strangest thing is that in\nthe  higher  classes,  too,  crime  is  increasing\nproportionately.  In  one  place  one  hears  of  a\nstudent's  robbing  the  mail  on  the  high  road;  in\nanother  place  people  of  good  social  position\nforge  false  banknotes;  in  Moscow  of  late  a\nwhole  gang  has  been  captured  who  used  to", "forge lottery tickets, and one of the ringleaders\nwas  a  lecturer  in  universal  history;  then  our\nsecretary  abroad  was  murdered  from  some\nobscure motive of gain.... And if this old woman,\nthe  pawnbroker,  has  been  murdered  by\nsomeone  of  a  higher  class  in  society-for\npeasants don't pawn gold trinkets- how are we\nto explain this demoralisation 1(cid:24) of the civilised\npart of our society?'\n'There  are  many  economic  changes,'  put  in\nZossimov.\n'How  are  we  to  explain  it?'  Razumihin  caught\nhim up. 'It might be explained by our inveterate\nimpracticality.'\n'How do you mean?'\n'What  answer  had  your  lecturer  in  Moscow  to\nmake  to  the  question  why  he  was  forging\nnotes?  'Everybody  is  getting  rich  one  way  or\nanother, so I want to make haste to get rich too.'\nI  don't  remember  the  exact  words,  but  the\nupshot  was  that  he  wants  money  for  nothing,\nwithout waiting or working! We've grown used to\nhaving  everything  readymade,  to  walking  on", "crutches,  to  having  our  food  chewed  for  us.\nThen  the  great  hour  struck,[*]  and  every  man\nshowed himself in his true colours.'\n[*]  The  emancipation  of  the  serfs  in  1861  is\nmeant.-TRANSLATOR'S NOTE.\n'But morality? And so to speak, principles ...'\n'But  why  do  you  worry  about  it?'  Raskolnikov\ninterposed  suddenly.  'It's  in  accordance  with\nyour theory!'\n'In accordance with my theory?'\n'Why,  carry  out  logically  the  theory  you  were\nadvocating  just  now,  and  it  follows  that  people\nmay be killed ...'\n'Upon my word!' cried Luzhin.\n'No, that's not so,' put in Zossimov.\nRaskolnikov lay with a white face and twitching\nupper lip, breathing painfully.\n'There's a measure in all things,' Luzhin went on", "superciliously.  'Economic  ideas  are  not  an\nincitement  to  murder,  and  one  has  but  to\nsuppose ...'(cid:24)(cid:24)0 Crime and Punishment 'And is it\ntrue,'  Raskolnikov  interposed  once  more\nsuddenly,  again  in  a  voice  quivering  with  fury\nand  delight  in  insulting  him,  'is  it  true  that  you\ntold  your  fiancée  ...  within  an  hour  of  her\nacceptance, that what pleased you most ... was\nthat she was a beggar ... because it was better\nto  raise  a  wife  from  poverty,  so  that  you  may\nhave  complete  control  over  her,  and  reproach\nher with your being her benefactor?'\n'Upon  my  word,'  Luzhin  cried  wrathfully  and\nirritably,  crimson  with  confusion,  'to  distort  my\nwords  in  this  way!  Excuse  me,  allow  me  to\nassure  you  that  the  report  which  has  reached\nyou,  or  rather,  let  me  say,  has  been  conveyed\nto  you,  has  no  foundation  in  truth,  and  I  ...\nsuspect  who  ...  in  a  word  ...  this  arrow  ...  in  a\nword,  your  mamma  ...

But  I  was  a  thousand  miles  from\nsupposing  that  she  would  misunderstand  and\nmisrepresent things in so fanciful a way.... And\nindeed ... indeed ...'", "'I  tell  you  what,'  cried  Raskolnikov,  raising\nhimself  on  his  pillow  and  fixing  his  piercing,\nglittering eyes upon him, 'I tell you what.'\n'What?' Luzhin stood still, waiting with a defiant\nand  offended  face.  Silence  lasted  for  some\nseconds.\n'Why,  if  ever  again  ...  you  dare  to  mention  a\nsingle word ... about my mother ... I shall send\nyou flying downstairs!'\n'What's the matter with you?' cried Razumihin.\n'So that's how it is?' Luzhin turned pale and bit\nhis  lip.  'Let  me  tell  you,  sir,'  he  began\ndeliberately, doing his utmost to restrain himself\nbut breathing hard, 'at the first moment (cid:24)1 I saw\nyou you were ill-disposed to me, but I remained\nhere on purpose to find out more. I could forgive\na great deal in a sick man and a connection, but\nyou ... never after this ...'\n'I am not ill,' cried Raskolnikov.\n'So much the worse ...'", "'Go to hell!'\nBut Luzhin was already leaving without finishing\nhis  speech,  squeezing  between  the  table  and\nthe chair; Razumihin got up this time to let him\npass. Without glancing at anyone, and not even\nnodding  to  Zossimov,  who  had  for  some  time\nbeen  making  signs  to  him  to  let  the  sick  man\nalone, he went out, lifting his hat to the level of\nhis shoulders to avoid crushing it as he stooped\nto go out of the door. And even the curve of his\nspine  was  expressive  of  the  horrible  insult  he\nhad received.\n'How  could  you-how  could  you!'  Razumihin\nsaid, shaking his head in perplexity.\n'Let  me  alone-let  me  alone  all  of  you!'\nRaskolnikov  cried  in  a  frenzy.  'Will  you  ever\nleave off tormenting me? I am not afraid of you!\nI  am  not  afraid  of  anyone,  anyone  now!  Get\naway from me! I want to be alone, alone, alone!'\n'Come  along,'  said  Zossimov,  nodding  to\nRazumihin.", "'But we can't leave him like this!'\n'Come  along,'  Zossimov  repeated  insistently,\nand  he  went  out.  Razumihin  thought  a  minute\nand ran to overtake him.\n'It  might  be  worse  not  to  obey  him,'  said\nZossimov on the stairs. 'He mustn't be irritated.'\n'What's the matter with him?'\n'If  only  he  could  get  some  favourable  shock,\nthat's what (cid:24) would do it! At first he was better....\nYou  know  he  has  got  something  on  his  mind!\nSome  fixed  idea  weighing  on  him....  I  am  very\nmuch afraid so; he must have!'\n'Perhaps  it's  that  gentleman,  Pyotr  Petrovitch.\nFrom  his  conversation  I  gather  he  is  going  to\nmarry  his  sister,  and  that  he  had  received  a\nletter about it just before his illness....'\n'Yes, confound the man! he may have upset the\ncase altogether. But have you noticed, he takes\nno interest in anything, he does not respond to\nanything  except  one  point  on  which  he  seems\nexcited-that's the murder?'", "'Yes,  yes,'  Razumihin  agreed,  'I  noticed  that,\ntoo.  He  is  interested,  frightened.  It  gave  him  a\nshock on the day he was ill in the police office;\nhe fainted.'\n'Tell me more about that this evening and I'll tell\nyou something afterwards. He interests me very\nmuch!  In  half  an  hour  I'll  go  and  see  him\nagain.... There'll be no inflammation though.'\n'Thanks!  And  I'll  wait  with  Pashenka  meantime\nand  will  keep  watch  on  him  through\nNastasya....'\nRaskolnikov,  left  alone,  looked  with  impatience\nand misery at Nastasya, but she still lingered.\n'Won't you have some tea now?' she asked.\n'Later! I am sleepy! Leave me.'\nHe  turned  abruptly  to  the  wall;  Nastasya  went\nout.(cid:24)(cid:24) ", "#$#$Chapter 14#$#$\nBut as soon as she went out, he got up, latched\nthe door, \nundid  the  parcel  which  Razumihin  had  brought\nin  that  evening  and  had  tied  up  again  and\nbegan  dressing.  Strange  to  say,  he  seemed\nimmediately to have become perfectly calm; not\na  trace  of  his  recent  delirium  nor  of  the  panic\nfear that had haunted him of late. It was the first\nmoment  of  a  strange  sudden  calm.  His\nmovements  were  precise  and  definite;  a  firm\npurpose  was  evident  in  them.  'To-day,  today,'\nhe  muttered  to  himself.  He  understood  that  he\nwas  still  weak,  but  his  intense  spiritual\nconcentration  gave  him  strength  and\nself-confidence.  He  hoped,  moreover,  that  he\nwould not fall down in the street. When he had\ndressed  in  entirely  new  clothes,  he  looked  at\nthe  money  lying  on  the  table,  and  after  a\nmoment's  thought  put  it  in  his  pocket.  It  was\ntwenty-five roubles. He took also all the copper\nchange  from  the  ten  roubles  spent  by\nRazumihin  on  the  clothes.  Then  he  softly", "unlatched  the  door,  went  out,  slipped\ndownstairs  and  glanced  in  at  the  open  kitchen\ndoor.  Nastasya  was  standing  with  her  back  to\nhim,  blowing  up  the  landlady's  samovar.  She\nheard nothing. Who would have dreamed of his\ngoing out, indeed? A minute later he was in the\nstreet.\nIt was nearly eight o'clock, the sun was setting.\nIt was as stifling as before, but he eagerly drank\nin  the  stinking,  dusty  town  air.  His  head  felt\nrather dizzy; a sort of savage energy (cid:24) gleamed\nsuddenly  in  his  feverish  eyes  and  his  wasted,\npale and yellow face. He did not know and did\nnot  think  where  he  was  going,  he  had  one\nthought only: 'that all this must be ended to-day,\nonce  for  all,  immediately;  that  he  would  not\nreturn home without it, because he would not go\non living like that. ' How, with what to make an\nend?  He  had  not  an  idea  about  it,  he  did  not\neven want to think of it. He drove away thought;\nthought tortured him. All he knew, all he felt was\nthat  everything  must  be  changed  'one  way  or\nanother,'  he  repeated  with  desperate  and\nimmovable self-confidence and determination.\nFrom  old  habit  he  took  his  usual  walk  in  the", "direction  of  the  Hay  Market.  A  dark-haired\nyoung man with a barrel organ was standing in\nthe road in front of a little general shop and was\ngrinding  out  a  very  sentimental  song.  He  was\naccompanying a girl of fifteen, who stood on the\npavement  in  front  of  him.  She  was  dressed  up\nin  a  crinoline,  a  mantle  and  a  straw  hat  with  a\nflame-coloured  feather  in  it,  all  very  old  and\nshabby. In a strong and rather agreeable voice,\ncracked  and  coarsened  by  street  singing,  she\nsang in hope of getting a copper from the shop.\nRaskolnikov  joined  two  or  three  listeners,  took\nout  a  five  copeck  piece  and  put  it  in  the  girl's\nhand.  She  broke  off  abruptly  on  a  sentimental\nhigh note, shouted sharply to the organ grinder\n'Come on,' and both moved on to the next shop.\n'Do  you  like  street  music?'  said  Raskolnikov,\naddressing a middle-aged man standing idly by\nhim.  The  man  looked  at  him,  startled  and\nwondering.\n'I  love  to  hear  singing  to  a  street  organ,'  said\nRaskolnikov,  (cid:24)(cid:24)  and  his  manner  seemed\nstrangely out of keeping with the subject-'I like it\non  cold,  dark,  damp  autumn  evenings-they\nmust  be  damp-when  all  the  passers-by  have", "pale green, sickly faces, or better still when wet\nsnow  is  falling  straight  down,  when  there's  no\nwind-you  know  what  I  mean?-and  the  street\nlamps shine through it ...'\n'I  don't  know....  Excuse  me  ...'  muttered  the\nstranger, frightened by the question and \nRaskolnikov's strange manner, and he crossed\nover to the other side of the street.\nRaskolnikov walked straight on and came out at\nthe  corner  of  the  Hay  Market,  where  the\nhuckster and his wife had talked with Lizaveta;\nbut  they  were  not  there  now.  Recognising  the\nplace, he stopped, looked round and addressed\na young fellow in a red shirt who stood gaping\nbefore a corn chandler's shop.\n'Isn't  there  a  man  who  keeps  a  booth  with  his\nwife at this corner?'\n'All sorts of people keep booths here,' answered\nthe young man, glancing superciliously at \nRaskolnikov.", "'What's his name?'\n'What he was christened.'\n'Aren't  you  a  Zaraïsky  man,  too?  Which\nprovince?'\nThe young man looked at \nRaskolnikov again.\n'It's  not  a  province,  your  excellency,  but  a\ndistrict. Graciously forgive me, your excellency!'\n'Is that a tavern at the top there?'\n'Yes,  it's  an  eating-house  and  there's  a\nbilliard-room  and  you'll  find  princesses  there\ntoo.... La-la!'\nRaskolnikov crossed the square. In that corner\nthere  was  (cid:24)  a  dense  crowd  of  peasants.  He\npushed  his  way  into  the  thickest  part  of  it,\nlooking  at  the  faces.  He  felt  an  unaccountable\ninclination  to  enter  into  conversation  with\npeople. But the peasants took no notice of him;\nthey  were  all  shouting  in  groups  together.  He", "stood and thought a little and took a turning to\nthe right in the direction of V.\nHe  had  often  crossed  that  little  street  which\nturns at an angle, leading from the market-place\nto  Sadovy  Street.  Of  late  he  had  often  felt\ndrawn to wander about this district, when he felt\ndepressed, that he might feel more so.\nNow  he  walked  along,  thinking  of  nothing.  At\nthat  point  there  is  a  great  block  of  buildings,\nentirely  let  out  in  dram  shops  and  eating-\nhouses; women were continually running in and\nout,  bare-headed  and  in  their  indoor  clothes.\nHere and there they gathered in groups, on the\npavement,  especially  about  the  entrances  to\nvarious  festive  establishments  in  the  lower\nstoreys.  From  one  of  these  a  loud  din,  sounds\nof singing, the tinkling of a guitar and shouts of\nmerriment,  floated  into  the  street.  A  crowd  of\nwomen  were  thronging  round  the  door;  some\nwere  sitting  on  the  steps,  others  on  the\npavement,  others  were  standing  talking.  A\ndrunken  soldier,  smoking  a  cigarette,  was\nwalking  near  them  in  the  road,  swearing;  he\nseemed to be trying to find his way somewhere,\nbut  had  forgotten  where.  One  beggar  was", "quarrelling with another, and a man dead drunk\nwas  lying  right  across  the  road.  Raskolnikov\njoined the throng of women, who were talking in\nhusky voices. They were bare-headed and wore\ncotton dresses and goatskin shoes. There were\nwomen  of  forty  and  some  not  more  than\nseventeen; almost (cid:24)(cid:24) all had blackened eyes.\nHe felt strangely attracted by the singing and all\nthe  noise  and  uproar  in  the  saloon  below....\nsomeone  could  be  heard  within  dancing\nfrantically,  marking  time  with  his  heels  to  the\nsounds of the guitar and of a thin falsetto voice\nsinging  a  jaunty  air.  He  listened  intently,\ngloomily  and  dreamily,  bending  down  at  the\nentrance  and  peeping  inquisitively  in  from  the\npavement.\n'Oh,  my  handsome  soldier  Don't  beat  me  for\nnothing,'\ntrilled  the  thin  voice  of  the  singer.  Raskolnikov\nfelt  a  great  desire  to  make  out  what  he  was\nsinging,  as  though  everything  depended  on\nthat.\n'Shall  I  go  in?'  he  thought.  'They  are  laughing.", "From drink. Shall I get drunk?'\n'Won't  you  come  in?'  one  of  the  women  asked\nhim.  Her  voice  was  still  musical  and  less  thick\nthan  the  others,  she  was  young  and  not\nrepulsive-the only one of the group.\n'Why, she's pretty,' he said, drawing himself up\nand looking at her.\nShe smiled, much pleased at the compliment.\n'You're very nice looking yourself,' she said.\n'Isn't he thin though!' observed another woman\nin  a  deep  bass.  'Have  you  just  come  out  of  a\nhospital?'\n'They're  all  generals'  daughters,  it  seems,  but\nthey  have  all  snub  noses,'  interposed  a  tipsy\npeasant with a sly smile on his face, wearing a\nloose coat. 'See how jolly they are.'\n'Go along with you!'\n'I'll go, sweetie!'", "And  he  darted  down  into  the  saloon  below.\nRaskolnikov (cid:24) moved on.\n'I say, sir,' the girl shouted after him.\n'What is it?'\nShe hesitated.\n'I'll  always  be  pleased  to  spend  an  hour  with\nyou,  kind  gentleman,  but  now  I  feel  shy.  Give\nme six copecks for a drink, there's a nice young\nman!'\nRaskolnikov  gave  her  what  came  first-fifteen\ncopecks.\n'Ah, what a good-natured gentleman!'\n'What's your name?'\n'Ask for Duclida.'\n'Well,  that's  too  much,'  one  of  the  women\nobserved, shaking her head at Duclida. 'I don't\nknow  how  you  can  ask  like  that.  I  believe  I\nshould drop with shame....'", "Raskolnikov  looked  curiously  at  the  speaker.\nShe  was  a  pock-marked  wench  of  thirty,\ncovered with bruises, with her upper lip swollen.\nShe  made  her  criticism  quietly  and  earnestly.\n'Where is it,' thought \nRaskolnikov. 'Where is it I've read that someone\ncondemned  to  death  says  or  thinks,  an  hour\nbefore his death, that if he had to live on some\nhigh rock, on such a narrow ledge that he'd only\nroom  to  stand,  and  the  ocean,  everlasting\ndarkness,  everlasting  solitude,  everlasting\ntempest  around  him,  if  he  had  to  remain\nstanding on a square yard of space all his life, a\nthousand years, eternity, it were better to live so\nthan to die at once! Only to live, to live and live!\nLife, whatever it may be! ... How true it is! Good\nGod,  how  true!  Man  is  a  vile  creature!  ...  And\nvile is he who calls him vile for that,' he added a\nmoment later.\nHe went into another street. 'Bah, the Palais de\nCristal!  (cid:24)(cid:24)  Razumihin  was  just  talking  of  the\nPalais  de  Cristal.  But  what  on  earth  was  it  I\nwanted? Yes, the newspapers.... Zossimov said\nhe'd  read  it  in  the  papers.  Have  you  the", "papers?'  he  asked,  going  into  a  very  spacious\nand  positively  clean  restaurant,  consisting  of\nseveral  rooms,  which  were,  however,  rather\nempty.  Two  or  three  people  were  drinking  tea,\nand  in  a  room  further  away  were  sitting  four\nmen  drinking  champagne.  Raskolnikov  fancied\nthat Zametov was one of them, but he could not\nbe  sure  at  that  distance.  'What  if  it  is?'  he\nthought.\n'Will you have vodka?' asked the waiter.\n'Give  me  some  tea  and  bring  me  the  papers,\nthe old ones for the last five days, and I'll give\nyou something.'\n'Yes, sir, here's to-day's. No vodka?'\nThe old newspapers and the tea were brought.\nRaskolnikov  sat  down  and  began  to  look\nthrough them.\n'Oh, damn ... these are the items of intelligence.\nAn  accident    on    a    staircase,    spontaneous \ncombustion    of    a  shopkeeper  from  alcohol,  a\nfire in Peski ... a fire in the Petersburg quarter ...\nanother  fire  in  the  Petersburg  quarter  ...  and", "another  fire  in  the  Petersburg  quarter....  Ah,\nhere it is!' He found at last what he was seeking\nand  began  to  read  it.  The  lines  danced  before\nhis  eyes,  but  he  read  it  all  and  began  eagerly\nseeking later additions in the following numbers.\nHis hands shook with nervous impatience as he\nturned the sheets. Suddenly someone sat down\nbeside him at his table. He looked up, it was the\nhead clerk Zametov, looking just the same, with\nthe  rings  on  his  fingers  and  the  watch-chain,\nwith the curly, black hair, parted and pomaded,\nwith  the  (cid:24)(cid:24)0  Crime  and  Punishment  smart\nwaistcoat,  rather  shabby  coat  and  doubtful\nlinen. He was in a good humour, at least he was\nsmiling  very  gaily  and  good-humouredly.  His\ndark  face  was  rather  flushed  from  the\nchampagne he had drunk.\n'What,  you  here?'  he  began  in  surprise,\nspeaking as though he'd known him all his life.\n'Why,  Razumihin  told  me  only  yesterday  you\nwere  unconscious.  How  strange!  And  do  you\nknow I've been to see you?'\nRaskolnikov knew he would come up to him. He\nlaid  aside  the  papers  and  turned  to  Zametov.\nThere was a smile on his lips, and a new shade", "of  irritable  impatience  was  apparent  in  that\nsmile.\n'I  know  you  have,'  he  answered.  'I've  heard  it.\nYou  looked  for  my  sock....  And  you  know\nRazumihin  has  lost  his  heart  to  you?  He  says\nyou've  been  with  him  to  Luise  Ivanovna's-you\nknow,  the  woman  you  tried  to  befriend,  for\nwhom  you  winked  to  the  Explosive  Lieutenant\nand  he  would  not  understand.  Do  you\nremember?  How  could  he  fail  to  understand-it\nwas quite clear, wasn't it?'\n'What a hot head he is!'\n'The explosive one?'\n'No, your friend Razumihin.'\n'You  must  have  a  jolly  life,  Mr.  Zametov;\nentrance  free  to  the  most  agreeable  places.\nWho's  been  pouring  champagne  into  you  just\nnow?'\n'We've  just  been  ...  having  a  drink  together....\nYou talk about pouring it into me!'", "'By  way  of  a  fee!  You  profit  by  everything!'\nRaskolnikov laughed, 'it's all right, my dear boy,'\nhe  added,  slapping  Za-(cid:24)1  metov  on  the\nshoulder. 'I am not speaking from temper, but in\na  friendly  way,  for  sport,  as  that  workman  of\nyours said when he was scuffling with Dmitri, in\nthe case of the old woman....'\n'How do you know about it?'\n'Perhaps I know more about it than you do.'\n'How strange you are.... I am sure you are still\nvery unwell. You oughtn't to have come out.'\n'Oh, do I seem strange to you?'\n'Yes.  What  are  you  doing,  reading  the\npapers?''Yes.'\n'There's a lot about the fires.'\n'No,  I  am  not  reading  about  the  fires.'  Here  he\nlooked  mysteriously  at  Zametov;  his  lips  were\ntwisted again in a mocking smile. 'No, I am not\nreading about the fires,' he went on, winking at\nZametov.  'But  confess  now,  my  dear  fellow,", "you're  awfully  anxious  to  know  what  I  am\nreading about?'\n'I am not in the least. Mayn't I ask a question?\nWhy do you keep on ... ?'\n'Listen,  you  are  a  man  of  culture  and\neducation?'\n'I was in the sixth class at the gymnasium,' said\nZametov with some dignity.\n'Sixth  class!  Ah,  my  cock-sparrow!  With  your\nparting and your rings- you are a gentleman of\nfortune.  Foo!  what  a  charming  boy!'  Here\nRaskolnikov broke into a nervous laugh right in\nZametov's  face.  The  latter  drew  back,  more\namazed than offended.\n'Foo!  how  strange  you  are!'  Zametov  repeated\nvery seri(cid:24) ously. 'I can't help thinking you are still\ndelirious.'\n'I  am  delirious?  You  are  fibbing,  my\ncock-sparrow!  So  I  am  strange?  You  find  me\ncurious, do you?'", "'Yes, curious.'\n'Shall I tell you what I was reading about, what I\nwas  looking  for?  See  what  a  lot  of  papers  I've\nmade them bring me. Suspicious, eh?'\n'Well, what is it?'\n'You prick up your ears?'\n'How do you mean-'prick up my ears'?'\n'I'll  explain  that  afterwards,  but  now,  my  boy,  I\ndeclare  to  you  ...  no,  better  'I  confess'  ...  No,\nthat's not right either; 'I make a deposition and\nyou  take  it.'  I  depose  that  I  was  reading,  that  I\nwas  looking  and  searching....'  he  screwed  up\nhis  eyes  and  paused.  'I  was  searching-and\ncame  here  on  purpose  to  do  it-for  news  of  the\nmurder  of  the  old  pawnbroker  woman,'  he\narticulated at last, almost in a whisper, bringing\nhis  face  exceedingly  close  to  the  face  of\nZametov.  Zametov  looked  at  him  steadily,\nwithout moving or drawing his face away. What\nstruck Zametov afterwards as the strangest part\nof  it  all  was  that  silence  followed  for  exactly  a\nminute,  and  that  they  gazed  at  one  another  all", "the while.\n'What  if  you  have  been  reading  about  it?'  he\ncried at last, perplexed and impatient. 'That's no\nbusiness of mine! What of it?'\n'The same old woman,' Raskolnikov went on in\nthe  same  whisper,  not  heeding  Zametov's\nexplanation,  'about  whom  you  were  talking  in\nthe police-office, you remember, when I fainted.\nWell,  do  you  understand  now?'(cid:24)(cid:24)  'What  do  you\nmean?  Understand  ...  what?'  Zametov  brought\nout, almost alarmed.\nRaskolnikov's  set  and  earnest  face  was\nsuddenly transformed, and he suddenly went off\ninto  the  same  nervous  laugh  as  before,  as\nthough utterly unable to restrain himself. And in\none  flash  he  recalled  with  extraordinary\nvividness  of  sensation  a  moment  in  the  recent\npast, that moment when he stood with the axe\nbehind  the  door,  while  the  latch  trembled  and\nthe men outside swore and shook it, and he had\na  sudden  desire  to  shout  at  them,  to  swear  at\nthem,  to  put  out  his  tongue  at  them,  to  mock\nthem, to laugh, and laugh, and laugh!", "'You are either mad, or ...' began Zametov, and\nhe broke off, as though stunned by the idea that\nhad suddenly flashed into his mind.\n'Or? Or what? What? Come, tell me!'\n'Nothing,'  said  Zametov,  getting  angry,  'it's \nall  nonsense!'\nBoth were silent. After his sudden fit of laughter\nRaskolnikov  became  suddenly  thoughtful  and\nmelancholy. He put his elbow on the table and\nleaned  his  head  on  his  hand.  He  seemed  to\nhave completely forgotten Zametov. The silence\nlasted for some time.\n'Why don't you drink your tea? It's getting cold,'\nsaid Zametov.\n'What! Tea? Oh, yes....' Raskolnikov sipped the\nglass,  put  a  morsel  of  bread  in  his  mouth  and,\nsuddenly  looking  at  Zametov,  seemed  to\nremember  everything  and  pulled  himself\ntogether.  At  the  same  moment  his  face\nresumed  its  original  (cid:24)  mocking  expression.  He\nwent on drinking tea.", "'There have been a great many of these crimes\nlately,' said Zametov. 'Only the other day I read\nin the Moscow News that a whole gang of false\ncoiners  had  been  caught  in  Moscow.  It  was  a\nregular society. They used to forge tickets!'\n'Oh, but it was a long time ago! I read about it a\nmonth  ago,'  Raskolnikov  answered  calmly.  'So\nyou  consider  them  criminals?'  he  added,\nsmiling.\n'Of course they are criminals.'\n'They?  They  are  children,  simpletons,  not\ncriminals!  Why,  half  a  hundred  people  meeting\nfor  such  an  object-what  an  idea!  Three  would\nbe too many, and then they want to have more\nfaith  in  one  another  than  in  themselves!  One\nhas only to blab in his cups and it all collapses.\nSimpletons!  They  engaged  untrustworthy\npeople  to  change  the  notes-  what  a  thing  to\ntrust to a casual stranger! Well, let us suppose\nthat these simpletons succeed and each makes\na  million,  and  what  follows  for  the  rest  of  their\nlives?  Each  is  dependent  on  the  others  for  the\nrest of his life! Better hang oneself at once! And\nthey  did  not  know  how  to  change  the  notes", "either; the man who changed the notes took five\nthousand  roubles,  and  his  hands  trembled.  He\ncounted  the  first  four  thousand,  but  did  not\ncount the fifth thousand-he was in such a hurry\nto get the money into his pocket and run away.\nOf  course  he  roused  suspicion.  And  the  whole\nthing  came  to  a  crash  through  one  fool!  Is  it\npossible?'\n'That  his  hands  trembled?'  observed  Zametov,\n'yes, that's quite possible. That, I feel quite sure,\nis possible. Sometimes one can't stand things.'(cid:24)(cid:24)\n'Can't stand that?'\n'Why,  could  you  stand  it  then?  No,  I  couldn't.\nFor the sake of a hundred roubles to face such\na  terrible  experience?  To  go  with  false  notes\ninto a bank where it's their business to spot that\nsort of thing! No, I should not have the face to\ndo it. Would you?'\nRaskolnikov had an intense desire again 'to put\nhis  tongue  out.'  Shivers  kept  running  down  his\nspine.\n'I  should  do  it  quite  differently,'  Raskolnikov\nbegan.  'This  is  how  I  would  change  the  notes:", "I'd  count  the  first  thousand  three  or  four  times\nbackwards and forwards, looking at every note\nand  then  I'd  set  to  the  second  thousand;  I'd\ncount that half-way through and then hold some\nfifty-rouble  note  to  the  light,  then  turn  it,  then\nhold it to the light again-to see whether it was a\ngood one. 'I am afraid,' I would say, 'a relation\nof  mine  lost  twenty-five  roubles  the  other  day\nthrough a false note,' and then I'd tell them the\nwhole  story.  And  after  I  began  counting  the\nthird,  'No,  excuse  me,'  I  would  say,  'I  fancy  I\nmade a mistake in the seventh hundred in that\nsecond thousand, I am not sure.' And so I would\ngive  up  the  third  thousand  and  go  back  to  the\nsecond and so on to the end. And when I had\nfinished, I'd pick out one from the fifth and one\nfrom the second thousand and take them again\nto  the  light  and  ask  again,  'Change  them,\nplease,' and put the clerk into such a stew that\nhe would not know how to get rid of me. When\nI'd  finished  and  had  gone  out,  I'd  come  back,\n'No, excuse me,' and ask for some explanation.\nThat's how I'd do it.'\n'Foo!  what  terrible  things  you  say!'  said\nZametov,  laugh(cid:24)  ing.  'But  all  that  is  only  talk.  I\ndare say when it came to deeds you'd make a", "slip.  I  believe  that  even  a  practised,  desperate\nman  cannot  always  reckon  on  himself,  much\nless  you  and  I.  To  take  an  example  near\nhome-that  old  woman  murdered  in  our  district.\nThe murderer seems to have been a desperate\nfellow,  he  risked  everything  in  open  daylight,\nwas  saved  by  a  miracle-but  his  hands  shook,\ntoo. He did not succeed in robbing the place, he\ncouldn't stand it. That was clear from the ...'\nRaskolnikov seemed offended.\n'Clear?  Why  don't  you  catch  him  then?'  he\ncried, maliciously gibing at Zametov.\n'Well, they will catch him.'\n'Who?  You?  Do  you  suppose  you  could  catch\nhim? You've a tough job! A great point for you is\nwhether a man is spending money or not. If he\nhad  no  money  and  suddenly  begins  spending,\nhe  must  be  the  man.  So  that  any  child  can\nmislead you.'\n'The  fact  is  they  always  do  that,  though,'\nanswered Zametov. 'A man will commit a clever\nmurder at the risk of his life and then at once he", "goes  drinking  in  a  tavern.  They  are  caught\nspending money, they are not all as cunning as\nyou  are.  You  wouldn't  go  to  a  tavern,  of\ncourse?'\nRaskolnikov  frowned  and  looked  steadily  at\nZametov.\n'You seem to enjoy the subject and would like to\nknow how I should behave in that case, too?' he\nasked with displeasure.\n'I  should  like  to,'  Zametov  answered  firmly  and\nseriously.  Somewhat  too  much  earnestness\nbegan to appear in his (cid:24)(cid:24) words and looks.\n'Very much?'\n'Very much!'\n'All  right  then.  This  is  how  I  should  behave,'\nRaskolnikov  began,  again  bringing  his  face\nclose  to  Zametov's,  again  staring  at  him  and\nspeaking  in  a  whisper,  so  that  the  latter\npositively  shuddered.  'This  is  what  I  should\nhave done. I should have taken the money and\njewels,  I  should  have  walked  out  of  there  and", "have gone straight to some deserted place with\nfences round it and scarcely anyone to be seen,\nsome  kitchen  garden  or  place  of  that  sort.  I\nshould have looked out beforehand some stone\nweighing  a  hundredweight  or  more  which  had\nbeen lying in the corner from the time the house\nwas built. I would lift that stone-there would sure\nto  be  a  hollow  under  it,  and  I  would  put  the\njewels and money in that hole. Then I'd roll the\nstone  back  so  that  it  would  look  as  before,\nwould  press  it  down  with  my  foot  and  walk\naway.  And  for  a  year  or  two,  three  maybe,  I\nwould not touch it. And, well, they could search!\nThere'd be no trace.'\n'You  are  a  madman,'  said  Zametov,  and  for\nsome  reason  he  too  spoke  in  a  whisper,  and\nmoved  away  from  Raskolnikov,  whose  eyes\nwere glittering. He had turned fearfully pale and\nhis  upper  lip  was  twitching  and  quivering.  He\nbent  down  as  close  as  possible  to  Zametov,\nand  his  lips  began  to  move  without  uttering  a\nword.  This  lasted  for  half  a  minute;  he  knew\nwhat  he  was  doing,  but  could  not  restrain\nhimself.  The  terrible  word  trembled  on  his  lips,\nlike the latch on that door; in another moment it\nwill break out, in another mo(cid:24) ment he will let it", "go, he will speak out.\n'And  what  if  it  was  I  who  murdered  the  old\nwoman  and  Lizaveta?'  he  said  suddenly\nand-realised what he had done.\nZametov looked wildly at him and turned white\nas  the  tablecloth.  His  face  wore  a  contorted\nsmile.\n'But  is  it  possible?'  he  brought  out  faintly.\nRaskolnikov looked wrathfully at him.\n'Own up that you believed it, yes, you did?'\n'Not  a  bit  of  it,  I  believe  it  less  than  ever  now,'\nZametov cried hastily.\n'I've  caught  my  cock-sparrow!  So  you  did\nbelieve  it  before,  if  now  you  believe  less  than\never?'\n'Not  at  all,'  cried  Zametov,  obviously\nembarrassed. 'Have you been frightening me so\nas to lead up to this?'\n'You  don't  believe  it  then?  What  were  you", "talking  about  behind  my  back  when  I  went  out\nof the police-office? And why did the explosive\nlieutenant  question  me  after  I  fainted?  Hey,\nthere,' he shouted to the waiter, getting up and\ntaking his cap, 'how much?'\n'Thirty copecks,' the latter replied, running up.\n'And  there  is  twenty  copecks  for  vodka.  See\nwhat  a  lot  of  money!'  he  held  out  his  shaking\nhand  to  Zametov  with  notes  in  it.  'Red  notes\nand  blue,  twenty-five  roubles.  Where  did  I  get\nthem?  And  where  did  my  new  clothes  come\nfrom?  You  know  I  had  not  a  copeck.  You've\ncross-examined  my  landlady,  I'll  be  bound....\nWell, that's enough! Assez causé! Till we meet\nagain!'\nHe  went  out,  trembling  all  over  from  a  sort  of\nwild  (cid:24)(cid:24)  hysterical  sensation,  in  which  there  was\nan  element  of  insufferable  rapture.  Yet  he  was\ngloomy  and  terribly  tired.  His  face  was  twisted\nas after a fit. His fatigue increased rapidly. Any\nshock,  any  irritating  sensation  stimulated  and\nrevived  his  energies  at  once,  but  his  strength\nfailed  as  quickly  when  the  stimulus  was\nremoved.", "Zametov,  left  alone,  sat  for  a  long  time  in  the\nsame  place,  plunged  in  thought.  Raskolnikov\nhad unwittingly worked a revolution in his brain\non a certain point and had made up his mind for\nhim conclusively.\n'Ilya Petrovitch is a blockhead,' he decided.\nRaskolnikov had hardly opened the door of the\nrestaurant  when  he  stumbled  against\nRazumihin on the steps. They did not see each\nother  till  they  almost  knocked  against  each\nother.  For  a  moment  they  stood  looking  each\nother  up  and  down.  Razumihin  was  greatly\nastounded,  then  anger,  real  anger  gleamed\nfiercely in his eyes.\n'So here you are!' he shouted at the top of his\nvoice-'you  ran  away  from  your  bed!  And  here\nI've  been  looking  for  you  under  the  sofa!  We\nwent up to the garret. I almost beat Nastasya on\nyour  account.  And  here  he  is  after  all.  Rodya!\nWhat  is  the  meaning  of  it?  Tell  me  the  whole\ntruth! Confess! Do you hear?'\n'It means that I'm sick to death of you all and I", "want  to  be  alone,'  Raskolnikov  answered\ncalmly.\n'Alone?  When  you  are  not  able  to  walk,  when\nyour  face  is  as  white  as  a  sheet  and  you  are\ngasping  for  breath!  Idiot!  ...  What  have  you\nbeen doing in the Palais de Cristal? Own up at\nonce!'(cid:24)(cid:24)0  Crime  and  Punishment  'Let  me  go!'\nsaid  Raskolnikov  and  tried  to  pass  him.  This\nwas  too  much  for  Razumihin;  he  gripped  him\nfirmly by the shoulder.\n'Let you go? You dare tell me to let you go? Do\nyou know what I'll do with you directly? I'll pick\nyou up, tie you up in a bundle, carry you home\nunder my arm and lock you up!'\n'Listen,    Razumihin,'    Raskolnikov    began \nquietly,  apparently  calm-  'can't  you  see  that \nI    don't    want    your  benevolence?  A  strange\ndesire  you  have  to  shower  benefits  on  a  man\nwho ... curses them, who feels them a burden in\nfact! Why did you seek me out at the beginning\nof  my  illness?  Maybe  I  was  very  glad  to  die.\nDidn't  I  tell  you  plainly  enough  to-day  that  you\nwere torturing me, that I was ... sick of you! You\nseem  to  want  to  torture  people!  I  assure  you", "that all that is seriously hindering my recovery,\nbecause  it's  continually  irritating  me.  You  saw\nZossimov went away just now to avoid irritating\nme.  You  leave  me  alone  too,  for  goodness'\nsake! What right have you, indeed, to keep me\nby force? Don't you see that I am in possession\nof  all  my  faculties  now?  How,  how  can  I\npersuade  you  not  to  persecute  me  with  your\nkindness? I may be ungrateful, I may be mean,\nonly  let  me  be,  for  God's  sake,  let  me  be!  Let\nme be, let me be!'\nHe began calmly, gloating beforehand over the\nvenomous  phrases  he  was  about  to  utter,  but\nfinished,  panting  for  breath,  in  a  frenzy,  as  he\nhad been with Luzhin.\nRazumihin stood a moment, thought and let his\nhand drop.\n'Well,  go  to  hell  then,'  he  said  gently  and\nthoughtfully. (cid:24)1 'Stay,' he roared, as Raskolnikov\nwas  about  to  move.  'Listen  to  me.  Let  me  tell\nyou,  that  you  are  all  a  set  of  babbling,  posing\nidiots! If you've any little trouble you brood over\nit  like  a  hen  over  an  egg.  And  you  are\nplagiarists  even  in  that!  There  isn't  a  sign  of", "independent  life  in  you!

In  any  circumstances  the  first  thing  for\nall of you is to be unlike a human being! Stop!'\nhe  cried  with  redoubled  fury,  noticing  that\nRaskolnikov  was  again  making  a\nmovement-'hear me out! You know I'm having a\nhouse-warming this evening, I dare say they've\narrived  by  now,  but  I  left  my  uncle  there-I  just\nran in-to receive the guests.

Since you\nhave gone out, there's no help for it! I'd give you\na  snug  easy  chair,  my  landlady  has  one  ...  a\ncup of tea, company.... Or you could lie on the\nsofa-any way you would be with us.... Zossimov\nwill be there too. Will you come?''No.'\n'R-rubbish!' Razumihin shouted, out of patience.\n'How  do  you  know?  You  can't  answer  for\nyourself!  You  don't  know  anything  about  it....\nThousands  of  times  I've  fought  tooth  and  nail", "with people and run back to them afterwards....\nOne  feels  ashamed  and  goes  back  to  a  man!\nSo  remember,  Potchinkov's  house  on  the  third\nstorey....'(cid:24)  'Why,  Mr.  Razumihin,  I  do  believe\nyou'd  let  anybody  beat  you  from  sheer\nbenevolence.'\n'Beat? Whom? Me? I'd twist his nose off at the\nmere idea! Potchinkov's house, 47, Babushkin's\nflat....'\n'I shall not come, Razumihin.' \nRaskolnikov turned and walked away.\n'I  bet  you  will,'  Razumihin  shouted  after  him.  'I\nrefuse  to  know  you  if  you  don't!  Stay,  hey,  is\nZametov in there?''Yes.'\n'Did you see him?''Yes.'\n'Talked to him?''Yes.''What  about?  Confound \nyou,  don't  tell  me  then. Potchinkov's house,\n47, Babushkin's flat, remember!'\nRaskolnikov  walked  on  and  turned  the  corner\ninto Sadovy  Street.  Razumihin  looked  after ", "him  thoughtfully. Then with a wave of his hand\nhe went into the house but stopped short of the\nstairs.\n'Confound  it,'  he  went  on  almost  aloud.  'He\ntalked  sensibly  but  yet  ...  I  am  a  fool!  As  if\nmadmen  didn't  talk  sensibly!  And  this  was  just\nwhat Zossimov seemed afraid of.' He struck his\nfinger on his forehead. 'What if ... how could I let\nhim go off alone? He may drown himself.... Ach,\nwhat  a  blunder!  I  can't.'  And  he  ran  back  to\novertake \nRaskolnikov,  but  there  was  no  trace  of  him.\nWith a curse he returned with rapid steps to the\nPalais de Cristal to question Zametov.\nRaskolnikov walked straight to X-- Bridge, stood\nin (cid:24)(cid:24) the middle, and leaning both elbows on the\nrail  stared  into  the  distance.  On  parting  with\nRazumihin,  he  felt  so  much  weaker  that  he\ncould scarcely reach this place. He longed to sit\nor  lie  down  somewhere  in  the  street.  Bending\nover  the  water,  he  gazed  mechanically  at  the\nlast  pink  flush  of  the  sunset,  at  the  row  of\nhouses growing dark in the gathering twilight, at\none  distant  attic  window  on  the  left  bank,", "flashing as though on fire in the last rays of the\nsetting sun, at the darkening water of the canal,\nand the water seemed to catch his attention. At\nlast  red  circles  flashed  before  his  eyes,  the\nhouses  seemed  moving,  the  passers-by,  the\ncanal  banks,  the  carriages,  all  danced  before\nhis  eyes.  Suddenly  he  started,  saved  again\nperhaps  from  swooning  by  an  uncanny  and\nhideous  sight.  He  became  aware  of  someone\nstanding on the right side of him; he looked and\nsaw  a  tall  woman  with  a  kerchief  on  her  head,\nwith a long, yellow, wasted face and red sunken\neyes.  She  was  looking  straight  at  him,  but\nobviously  she  saw  nothing  and  recognised  no\none. Suddenly she leaned her right hand on the\nparapet, lifted her right leg over the railing, then\nher  left  and  threw  herself  into  the  canal.  The\nfilthy  water  parted  and  swallowed  up  its  victim\nfor a moment, but an instant later the drowning\nwoman  floated  to  the  surface,  moving  slowly\nwith the current, her head and legs in the water,\nher skirt inflated like a balloon over her back.\n'A  woman  drowning!  A  woman  drowning!'\nshouted  dozens  of  voices;  people  ran  up,  both\nbanks  were  thronged  with  spectators,  on  the\nbridge  people  crowded  about  Raskolnikov,", "pressing  up  behind  him.(cid:24)  'Mercy  on  it!  it's  our\nAfrosinya!'  a  woman  cried  tearfully  close  by.\n'Mercy! save her! kind people, pull her out!'\n'A  boat,  a  boat'  was  shouted  in  the  crowd.  But\nthere  was  no  need  of  a  boat;  a  policeman  ran\ndown the steps to the canal, threw off his great\ncoat and his boots and rushed into the water. It\nwas  easy  to  reach  her:  she  floated  within  a\ncouple of yards from the steps, he caught hold\nof  her  clothes  with  his  right  hand  and  with  his\nleft seized a pole which a comrade held out to\nhim;  the  drowning  woman  was  pulled  out  at\nonce. They laid her on the granite pavement of\nthe  embankment.  She  soon  recovered\nconsciousness,  raised  her  head,  sat  up  and\nbegan  sneezing  and  coughing,  stupidly  wiping\nher wet dress with her hands. She said nothing.\n'She's  drunk  herself  out  of  her  senses,'  the\nsame woman's voice wailed at her side. 'Out of\nher  senses.  The  other  day  she  tried  to  hang\nherself, we cut her down. I ran out to the shop\njust  now,  left  my  little  girl  to  look  after  her-and\nhere  she's  in  trouble  again!  A  neighbour,\ngentleman,  a  neighbour,  we  live  close  by,  the\nsecond house from the end, see yonder....'", "The  crowd  broke  up.  The  police  still  remained\nround  the  woman,  someone  mentioned  the\npolice  station....  Raskolnikov  looked  on  with  a\nstrange  sensation  of  indifference  and  apathy.\nHe felt disgusted. 'No, that's loathsome ... water\n... it's not good enough,' he muttered to himself.\n'Nothing  will  come  of  it,'  he  added,  'no  use  to\nwait. What about the police office ... ? And why\nisn't  Zametov  at  the  police  office?  The  police\noffice  is  open  till  ten  o'clock....'  He  turned  his\nback to the railing and looked about him.(cid:24)(cid:24) 'Very\nwell  then!'  he  said  resolutely;  he  moved  from\nthe  bridge  and  walked  in  the  direction  of  the\npolice  office.  His  heart  felt  hollow  and  empty.\nHe  did  not  want  to  think.  Even  his  depression\nhad  passed,  there  was  not  a  trace  now  of  the\nenergy  with  which  he  had  set  out  'to  make  an\nend of it all.' Complete apathy had succeeded to\nit.\n'Well,  it's  a  way  out  of  it,'  he  thought,  walking\nslowly  and  listlessly  along  the  canal  bank.\n'Anyway I'll make an end, for I want to.... But is\nit  a  way  out?  What  does  it  matter!  There'll  be\nthe square yard of space-ha! But what an end!\nIs it really the end? Shall I tell them or not? Ah", "...  damn!  How  tired  I  am!  If  I  could  find\nsomewhere  to  sit  or  lie  down  soon!  What  I  am\nmost  ashamed  of  is  its  being  so  stupid.  But  I\ndon't  care  about  that  either!  What  idiotic  ideas\ncome into one's head.'\nTo reach the police office he had to go straight\nforward and take the second turning to the left.\nIt  was  only  a  few  paces  away.  But  at  the  first\nturning  he  stopped  and,  after  a  minute's\nthought, turned into a side street and went two\nstreets  out  of  his  way,  possibly  without  any\nobject,  or  possibly  to  delay  a  minute  and  gain\ntime.  He  walked,  looking  at  the  ground;\nsuddenly  someone  seemed  to  whisper  in  his\near;  he  lifted  his  head  and  saw  that  he  was\nstanding at the very gate of the house. He had\nnot passed it, he had not been near it since that\nevening.  An  overwhelming,  unaccountable\nprompting drew him on. He went into the house,\npassed through the gateway, then into the first\nentrance on the right, and began mounting the\nfamiliar  staircase  to  the  fourth  storey.  The\nnarrow,  steep  staircase  was  very  dark.  He  (cid:24)\nstopped at each landing and looked round him\nwith curiosity; on the first landing the framework\nof the window had been taken out. 'That wasn't", "so  then,'  he  thought.  Here  was  the  flat  on  the\nsecond  storey  where  Nikolay  and  Dmitri  had\nbeen  working.  'It's  shut  up  and  the  door  newly\npainted. So it's to let.' Then the third storey and\nthe fourth. 'Here!' He was perplexed to find the\ndoor  of  the  flat  wide  open.  There  were  men\nthere,  he  could  hear  voices;  he  had  not\nexpected that. After brief hesitation he mounted\nthe last stairs and went into the flat. It, too, was\nbeing  done  up;  there  were  workmen  in  it.  This\nseemed  to  amaze  him;  he  somehow  fancied\nthat he would find everything as he left it, even\nperhaps the corpses in the same places on the\nfloor.  And  now,  bare  walls,  no  furniture;  it\nseemed strange. He walked to the window and\nsat  down  on  the  window-sill.  There  were  two\nworkmen,  both  young  fellows,  but  one  much\nyounger than the other. They were papering the\nwalls with a new white paper covered with lilac\nflowers,  instead  of  the  old,  dirty,  yellow  one.\nRaskolnikov  for  some  reason  felt  horribly\nannoyed  by  this.  He  looked  at  the  new  paper\nwith dislike, as though he felt sorry to have it all\nso  changed.  The  workmen  had  obviously\nstayed  beyond  their  time  and  now  they  were\nhurriedly rolling up their paper and getting ready\nto  go  home.  They  took  no  notice  of", "Raskolnikov's  coming  in;  they  were  talking.\nRaskolnikov folded his arms and listened.\n'She  comes  to  me  in  the  morning,'  said  the\nelder to the younger, 'very early, all dressed up.\n'Why are you preening and prinking?' says I. 'I\nam  ready  to  do  anything  to  please  you,  Tit\nVassilitch!' That's a way of going on! And she (cid:24)(cid:24)\ndressed up like a regular fashion book!'\n'And what is a fashion book?' the younger one\nasked.  He  obviously  regarded  the  other  as  an\nauthority.\n'A  fashion  book  is  a  lot  of  pictures,  coloured,\nand  they  come  to  the  tailors  here  every\nSaturday,  by  post  from  abroad,  to  show  folks\nhow  to  dress,  the  male  sex  as  well  as  the\nfemale.  They're  pictures.  The  gentlemen  are\ngenerally  wearing  fur  coats  and  for  the  ladies'\nfluffles, they're beyond anything you can fancy.'\n'There's  nothing  you  can't  find  in  Petersburg,'\nthe younger cried enthusiastically, 'except father\nand mother, there's everything!'\n'Except  them,  there's  everything  to  be  found,", "my boy,' the elder declared sententiously.\nRaskolnikov  got  up  and  walked  into  the  other\nroom  where  the  strong  box,  the  bed,  and  the\nchest of drawers had been; the room seemed to\nhim  very  tiny  without  furniture  in  it.  The  paper\nwas the same; the paper in the corner showed\nwhere  the  case  of  ikons  had  stood.  He  looked\nat  it  and  went  to  the  window.  The  elder\nworkman looked at him askance.\n'What do you want?' he asked suddenly.\nInstead of answering Raskolnikov went into the\npassage and pulled the bell. The same bell, the\nsame cracked note. He rang it a second and a\nthird  time;  he  listened  and  remembered.  The\nhideous  and  agonisingly  fearful  sensation  he\nhad  felt  then  began  to  come  back  more  and\nmore vividly. He shuddered at every ring and it\ngave  him  more  and  more  satisfaction.(cid:24)  'Well,\nwhat do you want? Who are you?' the workman\nshouted,  going  out  to  him.  Raskolnikov  went\ninside again.\n'I  want  to  take  a  flat,'  he  said.  'I  am  looking\nround.'", "'It's  not  the  time  to  look  at  rooms  at  night!  and\nyou ought to come up with the porter.'\n'The  floors  have  been  washed,  will  they  be\npainted?'  Raskolnikov  went  on.  'Is  there  no\nblood?'\n'What blood?'\n'Why,  the  old  woman  and  her  sister  were\nmurdered here. There was a perfect pool there.'\n'But who are you?' the workman cried, uneasy.\n'Who am I?''Yes.'\n'You want to know? Come to the police station,\nI'll tell you.'\nThe workmen looked at him in amazement.\n'It's time for us to go, we are late. Come along,\nAlyoshka.  We  must  lock  up,'  said  the  elder\nworkman.\n'Very  well,  come  along,'  said  Raskolnikov", "indifferently, and going out first, he went slowly\ndownstairs.  'Hey,  porter,'  he  cried  in  the\ngateway.\nAt  the  entrance  several  people  were  standing,\nstaring  at  the  passers-  by;  the  two  porters,  a\npeasant woman, a man in a long coat and a few\nothers. Raskolnikov went straight up to them.\n'What do you want?' asked one of the porters.\n'Have you been to the police office?'\n'I've just been there. What do you want?'\n'Is it open?'(cid:24)(cid:24) 'Of course.'\n'Is the assistant there?'\n'He was there for a time. What do you want?'\nRaskolnikov  made  no  reply,  but  stood  beside\nthem lost in thought.\n'He's  been  to  look  at  the  flat,'  said  the  elder\nworkman, coming forward.", "'Which flat?'\n'Where we are at work. 'Why have you washed\naway  the  blood?'  says  he.  'There  has  been  a\nmurder here,' says he, 'and I've come to take it.'\nAnd he began ringing at the bell, all but broke it.\n'Come to the police station,' says he. 'I'll tell you\neverything there.' He wouldn't leave us.'\nThe porter looked at \nRaskolnikov, frowning and perplexed.\n'Who  are  you?'  he  shouted  as  impressively  as\nhe could.\n'I am Rodion Romanovitch \nRaskolnikov,  formerly  a  student,  I  live  in  Shil's\nhouse,  not  far  from  here,  flat  Number  14,  ask\nthe porter, he knows me.' \nRaskolnikov  said  all  this  in  a  lazy,  dreamy\nvoice, not turning round, but looking intently into\nthe darkening street.\n'Why have you been to the flat?'", "'To look at it.'\n'What is there to look at?'\n'Take him straight to the police station,' the man\nin the long coat jerked in abruptly.\nRaskolnikov  looked  intently  at  him  over  his\nshoulder and said in the same slow, lazy tones:\n'Come  along.'(cid:24)(cid:24)0  Crime  and  Punishment  'Yes,\ntake  him,'  the  man  went  on  more  confidently.\n'Why was he going into that what's in his mind,\neh?'\n'He's  not  drunk,  but  God  knows  what's  the\nmatter with him,' muttered the workman.\n'But  what  do  you  want?'  the  porter  shouted\nagain,  beginning  to  get  angry  in  earnest-'Why\nare you hanging about?'\n'You  funk  the  police  station  then?'  said\nRaskolnikov jeeringly.\n'How funk it? Why are you hanging about?'", "'He's a rogue!' shouted the peasant woman.\n'Why waste time talking to him?' cried the other\nporter,  a  huge  peasant  in  a  full  open  coat  and\nwith keys on his belt. 'Get along! He is a rogue\nand no mistake. Get along!'\nAnd  seizing  Raskolnikov  by  the  shoulder  he\nflung  him  into  the  street.  He  lurched  forward,\nbut  recovered  his  footing,  looked  at  the\nspectators in silence and walked away.\n'Strange man!' observed the workman.\n'There are strange folks about nowadays,' said\nthe woman.\n'You should have taken him to the police station\nall the same,' said the man in the long coat.\n'Better have nothing to do with him,' decided the\nbig porter. 'A regular rogue! Just what he wants,\nyou  may  be  sure,  but  once  take  him  up,  you\nwon't get rid of him.... We know the sort!'\n'Shall  I  go  there  or  not?'  thought  Raskolnikov,", "standing in the middle of the thoroughfare at the\ncross-roads,  and  he  looked  about  him,  as\nthough  expecting  from  someone  a  de-(cid:24)1  cisive\nword.  But  no  sound  came,  all  was  dead  and\nsilent like the stones on which he walked, dead\nto him, to him alone.... All at once at the end of\nthe  street,  two  hundred  yards  away,  in  the\ngathering dusk he saw a crowd and heard talk\nand shouts. In the middle of the crowd stood a\ncarriage.... A light gleamed in the middle of the\nstreet.  'What  is  it?'  Raskolnikov  turned  to  the\nright  and  went  up  to  the  crowd.  He  seemed  to\nclutch at everything and smiled coldly when he\nrecognised it, for he had fully made up his mind\nto go to the police station and knew that it would\nall soon be over.(cid:24) ", "#$#$Chapter 15#$#$\nAn  elegant  carriage  stood  in  the  middle  of  the\nroad with \na pair of spirited grey horses; there was no one\nin it, and the coachman had got off his box and\nstood  by;  the  horses  were  being  held  by  the\nbridle.... A mass of people had gathered round,\nthe police standing in front. One of them held a\nlighted  lantern  which  he  was  turning  on\nsomething  lying  close  to  the  wheels.  Everyone\nwas  talking,  shouting,  exclaiming;  the\ncoachman seemed at a loss and kept repeating:\n'What  a  misfortune!  Good  Lord,  what  a\nmisfortune!'\nRaskolnikov  pushed  his  way  in  as  far  as  he\ncould,  and  succeeded  at  last  in  seeing  the\nobject  of  the  commotion  and  interest.  On  the\nground  a  man  who  had  been  run  over  lay\napparently  unconscious,  and  covered  with\nblood; he was very badly dressed, but not like a\nworkman. Blood was flowing from his head and", "face;  his  face  was  crushed,  mutilated  and\ndisfigured. He was evidently badly injured.\n'Merciful  heaven!'  wailed  the  coachman,  'what\nmore could I do? If I'd been driving fast or had\nnot shouted to him, but I was going quietly, not\nin  a  hurry.  Everyone  could  see  I  was  going\nalong  just  like  everybody  else.  A  drunken  man\ncan't  walk  straight,  we  all  know....  I  saw  him\ncrossing  the  street,  staggering  and  almost\nfalling. I shouted again and a second and a third\ntime,  then  I  held  the  horses  in,  but  (cid:24)(cid:24)  he  fell\nstraight  under  their  feet!  Either  he  did  it  on\npurpose or he was very tipsy.... The horses are\nyoung  and  ready  to  take  fright  ...  they  started,\nhe  screamed  ...  that  made  them  worse.  That's\nhow it happened!'\n'That's  just  how  it  was,'  a  voice  in  the  crowd\nconfirmed.\n'He  shouted,  that's  true,  he  shouted  three\ntimes,' another voice declared.\n'Three  times  it  was,  we  all  heard  it,'  shouted  a\nthird.", "But  the  coachman  was  not  very  much\ndistressed  and  frightened.  It  was  evident  that\nthe  carriage  belonged  to  a  rich  and  important\nperson  who  was  awaiting  it  somewhere;  the\npolice,  of  course,  were  in  no  little  anxiety  to\navoid  upsetting  his  arrangements.  All  they  had\nto do was to take the injured man to the police\nstation and the hospital. No one knew his name.\nMeanwhile  Raskolnikov  had  squeezed  in  and\nstooped  closer  over  him.  The  lantern  suddenly\nlighted  up  the  unfortunate  man's  face.  He\nrecognised him.\n'I know him! I know him!' he shouted, pushing to\nthe  front.  'It's  a  government  clerk  retired  from\nthe  service,  Marmeladov.  He  lives  close  by  in\nKozel's house.... Make haste for a doctor! I will\npay,  see?'  He  pulled  money  out  of  his  pocket\nand  showed  it  to  the  policeman.  He  was  in\nviolent agitation.\nThe  police  were  glad  that  they  had  found  out\nwho  the  man  was.  Raskolnikov  gave  his  own\nname and address, and, as earnestly as if it had\nbeen his father, he besought the police to carry\nthe  unconscious  Marmeladov  to  his  lodging  at", "once.(cid:24)  'Just  here,  three  houses  away,'  he  said\neagerly,  'the  house  belongs  to  Kozel,  a  rich\nGerman. He was going home, no doubt drunk. I\nknow  him,  he  is  a  drunkard.  He  has  a  family\nthere, a wife, children, he has one daughter.... It\nwill  take  time  to  take  him  to  the  hospital,  and\nthere is sure to be a doctor in the house. I'll pay,\nI'll pay! At least he will be looked after at home\n... they will help him at once. But he'll die before\nyou get him to the hospital.' He managed to slip\nsomething  unseen  into  the  policeman's  hand.\nBut  the  thing  was  straightforward  and\nlegitimate,  and  in  any  case  help  was  closer\nhere.  They  raised  the  injured  man;  people\nvolunteered to help.\nKozel's  house  was  thirty  yards  away.\nRaskolnikov  walked  behind,  carefully  holding\nMarmeladov's head and showing the way.\n'This way, this way! We must take him upstairs\nhead  foremost.  Turn  round!  I'll  pay,  I'll  make  it\nworth your while,' he muttered.\nKaterina  Ivanovna  had  just  begun,  as  she\nalways  did  at  every  free  moment,  walking  to\nand  fro  in  her  little  room  from  window  to  stove", "and back again, with her arms folded across her\nchest,  talking  to  herself  and  coughing.  Of  late\nshe  had  begun  to  talk  more  than  ever  to  her\neldest girl, Polenka, a child of ten, who, though\nthere  was  much  she  did  not  understand,\nunderstood  very  well  that  her  mother  needed\nher,  and  so  always  watched  her  with  her  big\nclever eyes and strove her utmost to appear to\nunderstand. This time Polenka was undressing\nher  little  brother,  who  had  been  unwell  all  day\nand was going to bed. The boy was waiting for\nher  (cid:24)(cid:24)  to  take  off  his  shirt,  which  had  to  be\nwashed  at  night.  He  was  sitting  straight  and\nmotionless  on  a  chair,  with  a  silent,  serious\nface, with his legs stretched out straight before\nhim -heels together and toes turned out.\nHe was listening to what his mother was saying\nto  his  sister,  sitting  perfectly  still  with  pouting\nlips  and  wide-open  eyes,  just  as  all  good  little\nboys have to sit when they are undressed to go\nto bed. A little girl, still younger, dressed literally\nin rags, stood at the screen, waiting for her turn.\nThe  door  on  to  the  stairs  was  open  to  relieve\nthem  a  little  from  the  clouds  of  tobacco  smoke\nwhich  floated  in  from  the  other  rooms  and\nbrought  on  long  terrible  fits  of  coughing  in  the", "poor,  consumptive  woman.  Katerina  Ivanovna\nseemed to have grown even thinner during that\nweek  and  the  hectic  flush  on  her  face  was\nbrighter than ever.\n'You  wouldn't  believe,  you  can't  imagine,\nPolenka,'  she  said,  walking  about  the  room,\n'what  a  happy  luxurious  life  we  had  in  my\npapa's  house  and  how  this  drunkard  has\nbrought me, and will bring you all, to ruin! Papa\nwas a civil colonel and only a step from being a\ngovernor;  so  that  everyone  who  came  to  see\nhim said, 'We look upon you, Ivan Mihailovitch,\nas  our  governor!'  When  I  ...  when  ...'  she\ncoughed  violently,  'oh,  cursed  life,'  she  cried,\nclearing  her  throat  and  pressing  her  hands  to\nher breast, 'when I ... when at the last ball ... at\nthe  marshal's  ...  Princess  Bezzemelny  saw\nme-who gave me the blessing when your father\nand I were married, Polenka-she asked at once\n'Isn't  that  the  pretty  girl  who  danced  the  shawl\ndance at the breakingup?' (You must mend that\ntear, you must take your needle (cid:24) and darn it as\nI  showed  you,  or  to-morrow-cough,  cough,\ncough-he  will  make  the  hole  bigger,'  she\narticulated with effort.)  'Prince  Schegolskoy,  a \nkammerjunker,  had  just come from Petersburg", "then  ...  he  danced  the  mazurka  with  me  and\nwanted  to  make  me  an  offer  next  day;  but  I\nthanked  him  in  flattering  expressions  and  told\nhim that my heart had long been another's. That\nother was your father, Polya; papa was fearfully\nangry.... Is the water ready? Give me the shirt,\nand  the  stockings!  Lida,'  said  she  to  the\nyoungest  one,  'you  must  manage  without  your\nchemise  to-night  ...  and  lay  your  stockings  out\nwith it ... I'll wash them together.... How is it that\ndrunken  vagabond  doesn't  come  in?  He  has\nworn  his  shirt  till  it  looks  like  a  dish-  clout,  he\nhas torn it to rags! I'd do it all together, so as not\nto  have  to  work  two  nights  running!  Oh,  dear!\n(Cough,  cough,  cough,  cough!)  Again!  What's\nthis?' she cried, noticing a crowd in the passage\nand the men, who were pushing into her room,\ncarrying  a  burden.  'What  is  it?  What  are  they\nbringing? Mercy on us!'\n'Where  are  we  to  put  him?'  asked  the\npoliceman,  looking  round  when  Marmeladov,\nunconscious and covered with blood, had been\ncarried in.\n'On the sofa! Put him straight on the sofa, with\nhis head this way,' Raskolnikov showed him.", "'Run over in the road! Drunk!' someone shouted\nin the passage.\nKaterina  Ivanovna  stood,  turning  white  and\ngasping  for  breath.  The  children  were  terrified.\nLittle  Lida  screamed,  rushed  to  Polenka  and\nclutched at her, trembling all over.\nHaving  laid  Marmeladov  down,  Raskolnikov\nflew to (cid:24)(cid:24) Katerina Ivanovna.\n'For  God's  sake  be  calm,  don't  be  frightened!'\nhe said, speaking quickly, 'he was crossing the\nroad  and  was  run  over  by  a  carriage,  don't  be\nfrightened, he will come to, I told them bring him\nhere ... I've been here already, you remember?\nHe will come to; I'll pay!'\n'He's done it this time!' Katerina Ivanovna cried\ndespairingly and she rushed to her husband.\nRaskolnikov  noticed  at  once  that  she  was  not\none  of  those  women  who  swoon  easily.  She\ninstantly placed under the luckless man's head\na  pillow,  which  no  one  had  thought  of  and\nbegan undressing and examining him. She kept", "her head, forgetting herself, biting her trembling\nlips  and  stifling  the  screams  which  were  ready\nto break from her.\nRaskolnikov  meanwhile  induced  someone  to\nrun  for  a  doctor.  There  was  a  doctor,  it\nappeared, next door but one.\n'I've sent for a doctor,' he kept assuring Katerina\nIvanovna, 'don't be uneasy, I'll pay. Haven't you\nwater?  ...  and  give  me  a  napkin  or  a  towel,\nanything,  as  quick  as  you  can....  He  is  injured,\nbut not killed, believe me.... We shall see what\nthe doctor says!'\nKaterina Ivanovna ran to the window; there, on\na  broken  chair  in  the  corner,  a  large\nearthenware basin full of water had been stood,\nin  readiness  for  washing  her  children's  and\nhusband's  linen  that  night.  This  washing  was\ndone by \nKaterina  Ivanovna  at  night  at  least  twice  a\nweek, if not oftener. For the family had come to\nsuch  a  pass  that  they  were  practically  without\nchange  of  linen,  and  Katerina  Ivanovna  could\nnot  endure  uncleanliness  and,  rather  than  see", "dirt in (cid:24) the house, she preferred to wear herself\nout at night, working beyond her strength when\nthe rest were asleep, so as to get the wet linen\nhung on a line and dry by the morning. She took\nup the basin of water at Raskolnikov's request,\nbut  almost  fell  down  with  her  burden.  But  the\nlatter had already succeeded in finding a towel,\nwetted  it  and  began  washing  the  blood  off\nMarmeladov's face.\nKaterina Ivanovna stood by, breathing painfully\nand pressing her hands to her breast. She was\nin need of attention herself. Raskolnikov began\nto realise that he might have made a mistake in\nhaving  the  injured  man  brought  here.  The\npoliceman, too, stood in hesitation.\n'Polenka,'  cried  Katerina  Ivanovna,  'run  to\nSonia,  make  haste.  If  you  don't  find  her  at\nhome, leave word that her father has been run\nover  and  that  she  is  to  come  here  at  once  ...\nwhen she comes in. Run, Polenka! there, put on\nthe shawl.'\n'Run  your  fastest!'  cried  the  little  boy  on  the\nchair suddenly, after which he relapsed into the\nsame  dumb  rigidity,  with  round  eyes,  his  heels", "thrust forward and his toes spread out.\nMeanwhile  the  room  had  become  so  full  of\npeople  that  you  couldn't  have  dropped  a  pin.\nThe  policemen  left,  all  except  one,  who\nremained  for  a  time,  trying  to  drive  out  the\npeople who came in from the stairs. Almost all\nMadame  Lippevechsel's  lodgers  had  streamed\nin from the inner rooms of the flat; at first they\nwere  squeezed  together  in  the  doorway,  but\nafterwards they overflowed into the room. \nKaterina Ivanovna flew into a fury.\n'You  might  let  him  die  in  peace,  at  least,'  she\nshouted at (cid:24)(cid:24) the crowd, 'is it a spectacle for you\nto  gape  at?  With  cigarettes!  (Cough,  cough,\ncough!) You might as well keep your hats on....\nAnd  there  is  one  in  his  hat!  ...  Get  away!  You\nshould respect the dead, at least!'\nHer cough choked her-but her reproaches were\nnot without result. They evidently stood in some\nawe  of  Katerina  Ivanovna.  The  lodgers,  one\nafter  another,  squeezed  back  into  the  doorway\nwith  that  strange  inner  feeling  of  satisfaction\nwhich  may  be  observed  in  the  presence  of  a", "sudden  accident,  even  in  those  nearest  and\ndearest to the victim, from which no living man\nis  exempt,  even  in  spite  of  the  sincerest\nsympathy and compassion.\nVoices  outside  were  heard,  however,  speaking\nof  the  hospital  and  saying  that  they'd  no\nbusiness to make a disturbance here.\n'No  business  to  die!'  cried  Katerina  Ivanovna,\nand  she  was  rushing  to  the  door  to  vent  her\nwrath upon them, but in the doorway came face\nto  face  with  Madame  Lippevechsel  who  had\nonly  just  heard  of  the  accident  and  ran  in  to\nrestore  order.  She  was  a  particularly\nquarrelsome and irresponsible German.\n'Ah,  my  God!'  she  cried,  clasping  her  hands,\n'your  husband  drunken  horses  have  trampled!\nTo the hospital with him! I am the landlady!'\n'Amalia Ludwigovna, I beg you to recollect what\nyou  are  saying,'  Katerina  Ivanovna  began\nhaughtily (she always took a haughty tone with\nthe  landlady  that  she  might  'remember  her\nplace' and even now could not deny herself this\nsatisfaction).  'Amalia  Ludwigovna  ...'(cid:24)(cid:24)0  Crime", "and  Punishment  'I  have  you  once  before  told\nthat you to call me Amalia Ludwigovna may not\ndare; I am Amalia Ivanovna.'\n'You  are  not  Amalia  Ivanovna,  but  Amalia\nLudwigovna,  and  as  I  am  not  one  of  your\ndespicable  flatterers  like  Mr.  Lebeziatnikov,\nwho's laughing behind the door at this moment\n(a laugh and a cry of 'they are at it again' was in\nfact  audible  at  the  door)  so  I  shall  always  call\nyou  Amalia  Ludwigovna,  though  I  fail  to\nunderstand why you dislike that name. You can\nsee for yourself what has happened to Semyon\nZaharovitch; he is dying. I beg you to close that\ndoor  at  once  and  to  admit  no  one.  Let  him  at\nleast  die  in  peace!  Or  I  warn  you  the\nGovernor-General, himself, shall be informed of\nyour  conduct  to-morrow.  The  prince  knew  me\nas  a  girl;  he  remembers  Semyon  Zaharovitch\nwell  and  has  often  been  a  benefactor  to  him.\nEveryone  knows  that  Semyon  Zaharovitch  had\nmany  friends  and  protectors,  whom  he\nabandoned  himself  from  an  honourable  pride,\nknowing  his  unhappy  weakness,  but  now  (she\npointed to Raskolnikov) a generous young man\nhas  come  to  our  assistance,  who  has  wealth\nand  connections  and  whom  Semyon", "Zaharovitch  has  known  from  a  child.  You  may\nrest assured, Amalia Ludwigovna ...'\nAll  this  was  uttered  with  extreme  rapidity,\ngetting  quicker  and  quicker,  but  a  cough\nsuddenly  cut  short  Katerina  Ivanovna's\neloquence.  At  that  instant  the  dying  man\nrecovered  consciousness  and  uttered  a  groan;\nshe  ran  to  him.  The  injured  man  opened  his\neyes  and  without  recognition  or  understanding\ngazed  at  Raskolnikov  who  was  bending  over\nhim. He drew deep, slow, painful breaths; blood\noozed at the corners of his mouth and drops of\nperspiration  came  (cid:24)1  out  on  his  forehead.  Not\nrecognising  Raskolnikov,  he  began  looking\nround  uneasily.  Katerina  Ivanovna  looked  at\nhim with a sad but stern face, and tears trickled\nfrom her eyes.\n'My God! His whole chest is crushed! How he is\nbleeding,' she said in despair. 'We must take off\nhis clothes. Turn a little, Semyon Zaharovitch, if\nyou can,' she cried to him.\nMarmeladov recognised her.\n'A priest,' he articulated huskily.", "Katerina  Ivanovna  walked  to  the  window,  laid\nher  head  against  the  window  frame  and\nexclaimed in despair:\n'Oh, cursed life!'\n'A  priest,'  the  dying  man  said  again  after  a\nmoment's silence.\n'They've  gone  for  him,'  Katerina  Ivanovna\nshouted  to  him,  he  obeyed  her  shout  and  was\nsilent.  With  sad  and  timid  eyes  he  looked  for\nher;  she  returned  and  stood  by  his  pillow.  He\nseemed a little easier but not for long.\nSoon his eyes rested on little Lida, his favourite,\nwho  was  shaking  in  the  corner,  as  though  she\nwere  in  a  fit,  and  staring  at  him  with  her\nwondering childish eyes.\n'A-ah,'  he  signed  towards  her  uneasily.  He\nwanted to say something.\n'What now?' cried Katerina Ivanovna.\n'Barefoot, barefoot!' he muttered, indicating with", "frenzied eyes the child's bare feet.\n'Be silent,' Katerina Ivanovna cried irritably, 'you\nknow why she is barefooted.''Thank  God,  the \ndoctor,'  exclaimed  Raskolnikov,  relieved.(cid:24) The\ndoctor  came  in,  a  precise  little  old  man,  a\nGerman,  looking  about  him  mistrustfully;  he\nwent  up  to  the  sick  man,  took  his  pulse,\ncarefully  felt  his  head  and  with  the  help  of\nKaterina  Ivanovna  he  unbuttoned  the\nblood-stained shirt, and bared the injured man's\nchest.  It  was  gashed,  crushed  and  fractured,\nseveral  ribs  on  the  right  side  were  broken.  On\nthe  left  side,  just  over  the  heart,  was  a  large,\nsinister-looking  yellowish-black  bruise-a  cruel\nkick from the horse's hoof. The doctor frowned.\nThe  policeman  told  him  that  he  was  caught  in\nthe  wheel  and  turned  round  with  it  for  thirty\nyards on the road.\n'It's  wonderful  that  he  has  recovered\nconsciousness,'  the  doctor  whispered  softly  to\nRaskolnikov.\n'What do you think of him?' he asked.\n'He will die immediately.'", "'Is there really no hope?'\n'Not  the  faintest!  He  is  at  the  last  gasp....  His\nhead is badly injured, too ... Hm ... I could bleed\nhim if you like, but ... it would be useless. He is\nbound to die within the next five or ten minutes.'\n'Better bleed him then.'\n'If  you  like....  But  I  warn  you  it  will  be  perfectly\nuseless.'\nAt  that  moment  other  steps  were  heard;  the\ncrowd  in  the  passage  parted,  and  the  priest,  a\nlittle,  grey  old  man,  appeared  in  the  doorway\nbearing  the  sacrament.  A  policeman  had  gone\nfor  him  at  the  time  of  the  accident.  The  doctor\nchanged  places  with  him,  exchanging  glances\nwith  him.  Raskolnikov  begged  the  doctor  to\nremain a little while. He shrugged his shoulders\nand  remained.(cid:24)(cid:24)  All  stepped  back.  The\nconfession  was  soon  over.  The  dying  man\nprobably  understood  little;  he  could  only  utter\nindistinct  broken  sounds.  Katerina  Ivanovna\ntook  little  Lida,  lifted  the  boy  from  the  chair,\nknelt down in the corner by the stove and made", "the  children  kneel  in  front  of  her.  The  little  girl\nwas still trembling; but the boy, kneeling on his\nlittle  bare  knees,  lifted  his  hand  rhythmically,\ncrossing  himself  with  precision  and  bowed\ndown,  touching  the  floor  with  his  forehead,\nwhich  seemed  to  afford  him  especial\nsatisfaction.  Katerina  Ivanovna  bit  her  lips  and\nheld  back  her  tears;  she  prayed,  too,  now  and\nthen  pulling  straight  the  boy's  shirt,  and\nmanaged to cover the girl's bare shoulders with\na  kerchief,  which  she  took  from  the  chest\nwithout rising from her knees or ceasing to pray.\nMeanwhile  the  door  from  the  inner  rooms  was\nopened  inquisitively  again.  In  the  passage  the\ncrowd  of  spectators  from  all  the  flats  on  the\nstaircase grew denser and denser, but they did\nnot  venture  beyond  the  threshold.  A  single\ncandle-end lighted up the scene.\nAt that moment Polenka forced her way through\nthe  crowd  at  the  door.  She  came  in  panting\nfrom  running  so  fast,  took  off  her  kerchief,\nlooked for her mother, went up to her and said,\n'She's  coming,  I  met  her  in  the  street.'  Her\nmother made her kneel beside her.\nTimidly  and  noiselessly  a  young  girl  made  her", "way  through  the  crowd,  and  strange  was  her\nappearance  in  that  room,  in  the  midst  of  want,\nrags, death and despair. She, too, was in rags,\nher  attire  was  all  of  the  cheapest,  but  decked\nout  in  gutter  finery  of  a  special  stamp,\nunmistakably  (cid:24)  betraying  its  shameful  purpose.\nSonia stopped short in the doorway and looked\nabout  her  bewildered,  unconscious  of\neverything.  She  forgot  her  fourth-hand,  gaudy\nsilk  dress,  so  unseemly  here  with  its  ridiculous\nlong train, and her immense crinoline that filled\nup  the  whole  doorway,  and  her  light-coloured\nshoes,  and  the  parasol  she  brought  with  her,\nthough  it  was  no  use  at  night,  and  the  absurd\nround  straw  hat  with  its  flaring  flame-coloured\nfeather.  Under  this  rakishly-tilted  hat  was  a\npale,  frightened  little  face  with  lips  parted  and\neyes staring in terror. Sonia was a small thin girl\nof  eighteen  with  fair  hair,  rather  pretty,  with\nwonderful blue eyes. She looked intently at the\nbed  and  the  priest;  she  too  was  out  of  breath\nwith  running.  At  last  whispers,  some  words  in\nthe  crowd  probably,  reached  her.  She  looked\ndown and took a step forward into the room, still\nkeeping close to the door.\nThe  service  was  over.  Katerina  Ivanovna  went", "up  to  her  husband  again.  The  priest  stepped\nback  and  turned  to  say  a  few  words  of\nadmonition  and  consolation  to  Katerina\nIvanovna on leaving.\n'What  am  I  to  do  with  these?'  she  interrupted\nsharply and irritably, pointing to the little ones.\n'God  is  merciful;  look  to  the  Most  High  for\nsuccour,' the priest began.\n'Ach! He is merciful, but not to us.'\n'That's  a  sin,  a  sin,  madam,'  observed  the\npriest, shaking his head.\n'And  isn't  that  a  sin?'  cried  Katerina  Ivanovna,\npointing to the dying man.(cid:24)(cid:24) 'Perhaps those who\nhave  involuntarily  caused  the  accident  will\nagree  to  compensate  you,  at  least  for  the  loss\nof his earnings.'\n'You don't understand!' cried Katerina Ivanovna\nangrily waving her hand. 'And why should they\ncompensate me? Why, he was drunk and threw\nhimself  under  the  horses!  What  earnings?  He\nbrought  us  in  nothing  but  misery.  He  drank", "everything away, the drunkard! He robbed us to\nget  drink,  he  wasted  their  lives  and  mine  for\ndrink!  And  thank  God  he's  dying!  One  less  to\nkeep!'\n'You must forgive in the hour of death, that's a\nsin, madam, such feelings are a great sin.'\nKaterina  Ivanovna  was  busy  with  the  dying\nman;  she  was  giving  him  water,  wiping  the\nblood  and  sweat  from  his  head,  setting  his\npillow  straight,  and  had  only  turned  now  and\nthen  for  a  moment  to  address  the  priest.  Now\nshe flew at him almost in a frenzy.\n'Ah,  father!  That's  words  and  only  words!\nForgive!  If  he'd  not  been  run  over,  he'd  have\ncome home to-day drunk and his only shirt dirty\nand  in  rags  and  he'd  have  fallen  asleep  like  a\nlog, and I should have been sousing and rinsing\ntill  daybreak,  washing  his  rags  and  the\nchildren's and then drying them by the window\nand  as  soon  as  it  was  daylight  I  should  have\nbeen  darning  them.  That's  how  I  spend  my\nnights!  ...  What's  the  use  of  talking  of\nforgiveness! I have forgiven as it is!'", "A  terrible  hollow  cough  interrupted  her  words.\nShe  put  her  handkerchief  to  her  lips  and\nshowed it to the priest, pressing her other hand\nto  her  aching  chest.  The  handker(cid:24)  chief  was\ncovered with blood. The priest bowed his head\nand said nothing.\nMarmeladov  was  in  the  last  agony;  he  did  not\ntake his eyes off the face of Katerina Ivanovna,\nwho was bending over him again. He kept trying\nto  say  something  to  her;  he  began  moving  his\ntongue with difficulty and articulating indistinctly,\nbut  Katerina  Ivanovna,  understanding  that  he\nwanted  to  ask  her  forgiveness,  called\nperemptorily to him:\n'Be  silent!  No  need!  I  know  what  you  want  to\nsay!'  And  the  sick  man  was  silent,  but  at  the\nsame instant his wandering eyes strayed to the\ndoorway and he saw Sonia.\nTill  then  he  had  not  noticed  her:  she  was\nstanding in the shadow in a corner.\n'Who's that? Who's that?' he said suddenly in a\nthick  gasping  voice,  in  agitation,  turning  his\neyes  in  horror  towards  the  door  where  his", "daughter was standing, and trying to sit up.\n'Lie down! Lie do-own!' cried Katerina Ivanovna.\nWith  unnatural  strength  he  had  succeeded  in\npropping himself on his elbow. He looked wildly\nand  fixedly  for  some  time  on  his  daughter,  as\nthough not recognising her. He had never seen\nher  before  in  such  attire.  Suddenly  he\nrecognised  her,  crushed  and  ashamed  in  her\nhumiliation  and  gaudy  finery,  meekly  awaiting\nher turn to say good-bye to her dying father. His\nface showed intense suffering.\n'Sonia!  Daughter!  Forgive!'  he  cried,  and  he\ntried to hold out his hand to her, but losing his\nbalance, he fell off the sofa, face downwards on\nthe floor. They rushed to pick him up, they put\nhim on the sofa; but he was dying. Sonia with (cid:24)(cid:24)\na faint cry ran up, embraced him and remained\nso without moving. He died in her arms.\n'He's  got  what  he  wanted,'  Katerina  Ivanovna\ncried,  seeing  her  husband's  dead  body.  'Well,\nwhat's to be done now? How am I to bury him!\nWhat can I give them to-morrow to eat?'", "Raskolnikov went up to Katerina Ivanovna.\n'Katerina  Ivanovna,'  he  began,  'last  week  your\nhusband  told  me  all  his  life  and\ncircumstances....  Believe  me,  he  spoke  of  you\nwith  passionate  reverence.  From  that  evening,\nwhen  I  learnt  how  devoted  he  was  to  you  all\nand how he loved and respected you especially,\nKaterina  Ivanovna,  in  spite  of  his  unfortunate\nweakness,  from  that  evening  we  became\nfriends.... Allow me now ... to do something ... to\nrepay  my  debt  to  my  dead  friend.  Here  are\ntwenty roubles, I think-and if that can be of any\nassistance  to  you,  then  ...  I  ...  in  short,  I  will\ncome  again,  I  will  be  sure  to  come  again  ...  I\nshall,  perhaps,  come  again  to-morrow....\nGood-bye!'\nAnd he went quickly out of the room, squeezing\nhis  way  through  the  crowd  to  the  stairs.  But  in\nthe  crowd  he  suddenly  jostled  against  Nikodim\nFomitch,  who  had  heard  of  the  accident  and\nhad  come  to  give  instructions  in  person.  They\nhad  not  met  since  the  scene  at  the  police\nstation,  but  Nikodim  Fomitch  knew  him\ninstantly.", "'Ah, is that you?' he asked him.\n'He's dead,' answered Raskolnikov. 'The doctor\nand the priest have been, all as it should have\nbeen.  Don't  worry  the  poor  woman  too  much,\nshe is in consumption as it is. Try and cheer her\nup, if possible ... you are a kind-hearted man, (cid:24) I\nknow ...' he added with a smile, looking straight\nin his face.\n'But  you  are  spattered  with  blood,'  observed\nNikodim Fomitch, noticing in the lamplight some\nfresh stains on Raskolnikov's waistcoat.\n'Yes  ...  I'm  covered  with  blood,'  Raskolnikov\nsaid with a peculiar air; then he smiled, nodded\nand went downstairs.\nHe  walked  down  slowly  and  deliberately,\nfeverish  but  not  conscious  of  it,  entirely\nabsorbed  in  a  new  overwhelming  sensation  of\nlife and strength that surged up suddenly within\nhim. This sensation might be compared to that\nof  a  man  condemned  to  death  who  has\nsuddenly  been  pardoned.  Halfway  down  the\nstaircase he was overtaken by the priest on his\nway  home;  Raskolnikov  let  him  pass,", "exchanging  a  silent  greeting  with  him.  He  was\njust  descending  the  last  steps  when  he  heard\nrapid  footsteps  behind  him.  someone  overtook\nhim; it was Polenka. She was running after him,\ncalling 'Wait! wait!'\nHe turned round. She was at the bottom of the\nstaircase  and  stopped  short  a  step  above  him.\nA dim light came in from the yard. Raskolnikov\ncould distinguish the child's thin but pretty little\nface, looking at him with a bright childish smile.\nShe  had  run  after  him  with  a  message  which\nshe was evidently glad to give.\n'Tell  me,  what  is  your  name?  ...  and  where  do\nyou  live?'  she  said  hurriedly  in  a  breathless\nvoice.\nHe laid both hands on her shoulders and looked\nat her with a sort of rapture. It was such a joy to\nhim to look at her, he could not have said why.(cid:24)(cid:24)\n'Who sent you?'\n'Sister  Sonia  sent  me,'  answered  the  girl,\nsmiling still more brightly.\n'I knew it was sister Sonia sent you.'", "'Mamma sent me, too ... when sister Sonia was\nsending  me,  mamma  came  up,  too,  and  said\n'Run fast, Polenka.''\n'Do you love sister Sonia?'\n'I  love  her  more  than  anyone,'  Polenka\nanswered with a peculiar earnestness, and her\nsmile became graver.\n'And will you love me?'\nBy  way  of  answer  he  saw  the  little  girl's  face\napproaching him, her full lips naïvely held out to\nkiss  him.  Suddenly  her  arms  as  thin  as  sticks\nheld him tightly, her head rested on his shoulder\nand  the  little  girl  wept  softly,  pressing  her  face\nagainst him.\n'I am sorry for father,' she said a moment later,\nraising  her  tear-  stained  face  and  brushing\naway the tears with her hands. 'It's nothing but\nmisfortunes now,' she added suddenly with that\npeculiarly  sedate  air  which  children  try  hard  to\nassume when they want to speak like grown-up\npeople.", "'Did your father love you?'\n'He loved Lida most,' she went on very seriously\nwithout  a  smile,  exactly  like  grown-up  people,\n'he loved her because she is little and because\nshe is ill, too. And he always used to bring her\npresents.  But  he  taught  us  to  read  and  me\ngrammar  and  scripture,  too,'  she  added  with\ndignity. 'And mother never used to say anything,\nbut we knew that she liked it and father knew it,\ntoo. And mother wants to teach me French, for\nit's  time  my  education  began.'(cid:24)(cid:24)0  Crime  and\nPunishment 'And do you know your prayers?'\n'Of  course,  we  do!  We  knew  them  long  ago.  I\nsay my prayers to myself as I am a big girl now,\nbut Kolya and Lida say them aloud with mother.\nFirst  they  repeat  the  'Ave  Maria'  and  then\nanother  prayer:  'Lord,  forgive  and  bless  sister\nSonia,'  and  then  another,  'Lord,  forgive  and\nbless our second father.' For our elder father is\ndead and this is another one, but we do pray for\nthe other as well.'\n'Polenka, my name is Rodion. Pray sometimes\nfor  me,  too.  'And  Thy  servant  Rodion,'  nothing", "more.'\n'I'll pray for you all the rest of my life,' the little\ngirl  declared  hotly,  and  suddenly  smiling  again\nshe rushed at him and hugged him warmly once\nmore.\nRaskolnikov told her his name and address and\npromised  to  be  sure  to  come  next  day.  The\nchild  went  away  quite  enchanted  with  him.  It\nwas past ten when he came out into the street.\nIn five minutes he was standing on the bridge at\nthe spot where the woman had jumped in.\n'Enough,'  he  pronounced  resolutely  and\ntriumphantly.  'I've  done  with  fancies,  imaginary\nterrors and phantoms! Life is real! haven't I lived\njust now? My life has not yet died with that old\nwoman!  The  Kingdom  of  Heaven  to  her-and\nnow enough, madam, leave me in peace! Now\nfor  the  reign  of  reason  and  light  ...  and  of  will,\nand of strength ... and now we will see! We will\ntry our strength!' he added defiantly, as though\nchallenging  some  power  of  darkness.  'And  I\nwas  ready  to  consent  to  live  in  a  square  of\nspace!", "'I am very weak at this moment, but ... I believe\nmy  illness  is  all  over.  I  knew  it  would  be  over\nwhen  I  went  out.  (cid:24)1  By  the  way,  Potchinkov's\nhouse is only a few steps away. I certainly must\ngo to Razumihin even if it were not close by ...\nlet  him  win  his  bet!  Let  us  give  him  some\nsatisfaction, too-no matter! Strength, strength is\nwhat one wants, you can get nothing without it,\nand  strength  must  be  won  by  strength-that's\nwhat  they  don't  know,'  he  added  proudly  and\nself-confidently  and  he  walked  with  flagging\nfootsteps  from  the  bridge.  Pride  and\nself-confidence  grew  continually  stronger  in\nhim;  he  was  becoming  a  different  man  every\nmoment.  What  was  it  had  happened  to  work\nthis revolution in him? He did not know himself;\nlike a man catching at a straw, he suddenly felt\nthat  he,  too,  'could  live,  that  there  was  still  life\nfor  him,  that  his  life  had  not  died  with  the  old\nwoman.'  Perhaps  he  was  in  too  great  a  hurry\nwith his conclusions, but he did not think of that.\n'But  I  did  ask  her  to  remember  'Thy  servant\nRodion'  in  her  prayers,'  the  idea  struck  him.\n'Well,  that  was  ...  in  case  of  emergency,'  he\nadded  and  laughed  himself  at  his  boyish  sally.\nHe was in the best of spirits.", "He easily found Razumihin; the new lodger was\nalready known at Potchinkov's and the porter at\nonce showed him the way. Half-way upstairs he\ncould hear the noise and animated conversation\nof a big gathering of people. The door was wide\nopen on the stairs; he could hear exclamations\nand  discussion.  Razumihin's  room  was  fairly\nlarge; the company consisted of fifteen people.\nRaskolnikov stopped in the entry, where two of\nthe  landlady's  servants  were  busy  behind  a\nscreen  with  two  samovars,  bottles,  plates  and\ndishes  of  pie  and  savouries,  brought  up  from\nthe landlady's kitchen. Ras(cid:24) kolnikov sent in for\nRazumihin.  He  ran  out  delighted.  At  the  first\nglance it was apparent that he had had a great\ndeal  to  drink  and,  though  no  amount  of  liquor\nmade  Razumihin  quite  drunk,  this  time  he  was\nperceptibly affected by it.\n'Listen,' Raskolnikov hastened to say, 'I've only\njust  come  to  tell  you  you've  won  your  bet  and\nthat no one really knows what may not happen\nto him. I can't come in; I am so weak that I shall\nfall  down  directly.  And  so  good  evening  and\ngood-bye! Come and see me to-morrow.'", "'Do  you  know  what?  I'll  see  you  home.  If  you\nsay you're weak yourself, you must ...'\n'And your visitors? Who is the curly-headed one\nwho has just peeped out?'\n'He?  Goodness  only  knows!  Some  friend  of\nuncle's,  I  expect,  or  perhaps  he  has  come\nwithout  being  invited  ...  I'll  leave  uncle  with\nthem,  he  is  an  invaluable  person,  pity  I  can't\nintroduce  you  to  him  now.  But  confound  them\nall now! They won't notice me, and I need a little\nfresh  air,  for  you've  come  just  in  the  nick  of\ntime-another  two  minutes  and  I  should  have\ncome  to  blows!  They  are  talking  such  a  lot  of\nwild stuff ... you simply can't imagine what men\nwill  say!  Though  why  shouldn't  you  imagine?\nDon't we talk nonsense ourselves? And let them\n...  that's  the  way  to  learn  not  to!  ...  Wait  a\nminute, I'll fetch Zossimov.'\nZossimov  pounced  upon  Raskolnikov  almost\ngreedily;  he  showed  a  special  interest  in  him;\nsoon his face brightened.\n'You  must  go  to  bed  at  once,'  he  pronounced,\nexamining  the  patient  as  far  as  he  could,  'and", "take something for the (cid:24)(cid:24) night. Will you take it? I\ngot it ready some time ago ... a powder.'\n'Two,  if  you  like,'  answered  Raskolnikov.  The\npowder was taken at once.\n'It's  a  good  thing  you  are  taking  him  home,'\nobserved Zossimov to Razumihin-'we shall see\nhow  he  is  to-morrow,  to-day  he's  not  at  all\namiss-a  considerable  change  since  the\nafternoon. Live and learn ...'\n'Do you know what Zossimov whispered to me\nwhen we were coming out?' Razumihin blurted\nout, as soon as they were in the street. 'I won't\ntell  you  everything,  brother,  because  they  are\nsuch  fools.  Zossimov  told  me  to  talk  freely  to\nyou on the way and get you to talk freely to me,\nand afterwards I am to tell him about it, for he's\ngot a notion in his head that you are ... mad or\nclose on it. Only fancy! In the first place, you've\nthree times the brains he has; in the second, if\nyou are not mad, you needn't care a hang that\nhe  has  got  such  a  wild  idea;  and  thirdly,  that\npiece  of  beef  whose  specialty  is  surgery  has\ngone  mad  on  mental  diseases,  and  what's\nbrought  him  to  this  conclusion  about  you  was", "your conversation to-day with Zametov.'\n'Zametov told you all about it?'\n'Yes, and he did well. Now I understand what it\nall  means  and  so  does  Zametov....  Well,  the\nfact is, Rodya ... the point is ... I am a little drunk\nnow.... But that's ... no matter ... the point is that\nthis  idea  ...  you  understand?  was  just  being\nhatched in their brains ... you understand? That\nis, no one ventured to say it aloud, because the\nidea  is  too  absurd  and  especially  since  the\narrest  of  that  painter,  that  bubble's  (cid:24)  burst  and\ngone  for  ever.  But  why  are  they  such  fools?  I\ngave  Zametov  a  bit  of  a  thrashing  at  the  time-\nthat's  between  ourselves,  brother;  please  don't\nlet out a hint that you know of it; I've noticed he\nis a ticklish subject; it was at Luise Ivanovna's.\nBut  to-day,  to-day  it's  all  cleared  up.  That  Ilya\nPetrovitch  is  at  the  bottom  of  it!  He  took\nadvantage of your fainting at the police station,\nbut he is ashamed of it himself now; I know that\n...'\nRaskolnikov  listened  greedily.  Razumihin  was\ndrunk enough to talk too freely.", "'I fainted then because it was so close and the\nsmell of paint,' said Raskolnikov.\n'No need to explain that! And it wasn't the paint\nonly: the fever had been coming on for a month;\nZossimov testifies to that! But how crushed that\nboy  is  now,  you  wouldn't  believe!  'I  am  not\nworth  his  little  finger,'  he  says.  Yours,  he\nmeans. He has good feelings at times, brother.\nBut the lesson, the lesson you gave him to-day\nin  the  Palais  de  Cristal,  that  was  too  good  for\nanything! You frightened him at first, you know,\nhe  nearly  went  into  convulsions!  You  almost\nconvinced  him  again  of  the  truth  of  all  that\nhideous  nonsense,  and  then  you  suddenly-put\nout  your  tongue  at  him:  'There  now,  what  do\nyou  make  of  it?'  It  was  perfect!  He  is  crushed,\nannihilated  now!  It  was  masterly,  by  Jove,  it's\nwhat  they  deserve!  Ah,  that  I  wasn't  there!  He\nwas  hoping  to  see  you  awfully.  Porfiry,  too,\nwants to make your acquaintance ...'\n'Ah! ... he too ... but why did they put me down\nas mad?'\n'Oh,  not  mad.  I  must  have  said  too  much,\nbrother....  What  struck  him,  you  see,  was  that", "only that subject seemed (cid:24)(cid:24) to interest you; now\nit's clear why it did interest you; knowing all the\ncircumstances ... and how that irritated you and\nworked in with your illness ... I am a little drunk,\nbrother, only, confound him, he has some idea\nof  his  own  ...  I  tell  you,  he's  mad  on  mental\ndiseases. But don't you mind him ...'\nFor half a minute both were silent.\n'Listen, Razumihin,' began Raskolnikov, 'I want\nto tell you plainly: I've just been at a death-bed,\na clerk who died ... I gave them all my money ...\nand  besides  I've  just  been  kissed  by  someone\nwho, if I had killed anyone, would just the same\n...  in  fact  I  saw  someone  else  there  ...  with  a\nflamecoloured  feather  ...  but  I  am  talking\nnonsense;  I  am  very  weak,  support  me  ...  we\nshall be at the stairs directly ...'\n'What's  the  matter?  What's  the  matter  with\nyou?' Razumihin asked anxiously.\n'I am a little giddy, but that's not the point, I am\nso  sad,  so  sad  ...  like  a  woman.  Look,  what's\nthat? Look, look!'", "'What is it?'\n'Don't  you  see?  A  light  in  my  room,  you  see?\nThrough the crack ...'\nThey were already at the foot of the last flight of\nstairs,  at  the  level  of  the  landlady's  door,  and\nthey could, as a fact, see from below that there\nwas a light in Raskolnikov's garret.\n'Queer!  Nastasya,  perhaps,'  observed\nRazumihin.\n'She  is  never  in  my  room  at  this  time  and  she\nmust  be  in  bed  long  ago,  but  ...  I  don't  care!\nGood-bye!'\n'What do you mean? I am coming with you, we'll\ncome  in  together!'(cid:24)  'I  know  we  are  going  in\ntogether,  but  I  want  to  shake  hands  here  and\nsay  good-bye  to  you  here.  So  give  me  your\nhand, good-bye!'\n'What's the matter with you, Rodya?'\n'Nothing ... come along ... you shall be witness.'", "They  began  mounting  the  stairs,  and  the  idea\nstruck Razumihin that perhaps Zossimov might\nbe  right  after  all.  'Ah,  I've  upset  him  with  my\nchatter!' he muttered to himself.\nWhen they reached the door they heard voices\nin the room.\n'What  is  it?'  cried  Razumihin.  Raskolnikov  was\nthe  first  to  open  the  door;  he  flung  it  wide  and\nstood still in the doorway, dumbfoundered.\nHis  mother  and  sister  were  sitting  on  his  sofa\nand  had  been  waiting  an  hour  and  a  half  for\nhim. Why had he never expected, never thought\nof them, though the news that they had started,\nwere  on  their  way  and  would  arrive\nimmediately,  had  been  repeated  to  him  only\nthat  day?  They  had  spent  that  hour  and  a  half\nplying  Nastasya  with  questions.  She  was\nstanding  before  them  and  had  told  them\neverything  by  now.  They  were  beside\nthemselves  with  alarm  when  they  heard  of  his\n'running  away'  to-day,  ill  and,  as  they\nunderstood  from  her  story,  delirious!  'Good\nHeavens,  what  had  become  of  him?'  Both  had\nbeen  weeping,  both  had  been  in  anguish  for", "that hour and a half.\nA  cry  of  joy,  of  ecstasy,  greeted  Raskolnikov's\nentrance. Both rushed to him. But he stood like\none dead; a sudden intolerable sensation struck\nhim like a thunderbolt. He did not lift his arms to\nembrace them, he could not. His mother (cid:24)(cid:24) and\nsister  clasped  him  in  their  arms,  kissed  him,\nlaughed and cried. He took a step, tottered and\nfell to the ground, fainting.\nAnxiety,  cries  of  horror,  moans  ...  Razumihin\nwho  was  standing  in  the  doorway  flew  into  the\nroom,  seized  the  sick  man  in  his  strong  arms\nand in a moment had him on the sofa.\n'It's nothing, nothing!' he cried to the mother and\nsister-'it's  only  a  faint,  a  mere  trifle!  Only  just\nnow the doctor said he was much better, that he\nis  perfectly  well!  Water!  See,  he  is  coming  to\nhimself, he is all right again!'\nAnd  seizing  Dounia  by  the  arm  so  that  he\nalmost dislocated it, he made her bend down to\nsee  that  'he  is  all  right  again.'  The  mother  and\nsister looked on him with emotion and gratitude,\nas  their  Providence.  They  had  heard  already", "from  Nastasya  all  that  had  been  done  for  their\nRodya during his illness, by this 'very competent\nyoung  man,'  as  Pulcheria  Alexandrovna\nRaskolnikov  called  him  that  evening  in\nconversation with Dounia.(cid:24) ", "#$#$Chapter 16#$#$\n(cid:24)(cid:24) ", "#$#$Chapter 17#$#$\nRaskolnikov got up, and sat down on the sofa.\nHe waved \nhis  hand  weakly  to  Razumihin  to  cut  short  the\nflow  of  warm  and  incoherent  consolations  he\nwas  addressing  to  his  mother  and  sister,  took\nthem both by the hand and for a minute or two\ngazed  from  one  to  the  other  without  speaking.\nHis  mother  was  alarmed  by  his  expression.  It\nrevealed  an  emotion  agonisingly  poignant,  and\nat the same time something immovable, almost\ninsane. Pulcheria Alexandrovna began to cry.\nAvdotya  Romanovna  was  pale;  her  hand\ntrembled in her brother's.\n'Go  home  ...  with  him,'  he  said  in  a  broken\nvoice,  pointing  to  Razumihin,  'good-bye  till\nto-morrow;  to-morrow  everything  ...  Is  it  long\nsince you arrived?'\n'This  evening,  Rodya,'  answered  Pulcheria\nAlexandrovna,  'the  train  was  awfully  late.  But,", "Rodya,  nothing  would  induce  me  to  leave  you\nnow! I will spend the night here, near you ...'\n'Don't  torture  me!'  he  said  with  a  gesture  of\nirritation.\n'I  will  stay  with  him,'  cried  Razumihin,  'I  won't\nleave him for a moment. Bother all my visitors!\nLet them rage to their hearts' content! My uncle\nis presiding there.'\n'How,  how  can  I  thank  you!'  Pulcheria\nAlexandrovna  was  beginning,  once  more\npressing Razumihin's hands, but (cid:24)(cid:24)0 Crime and\nPunishment Raskolnikov interrupted her again.\n'I  can't  have  it!  I  can't  have  it!'  he  repeated\nirritably, 'don't worry me! Enough, go away ... I\ncan't stand it!'\n'Come, mamma, come out of the room at least\nfor a minute,' Dounia whispered in dismay; 'we\nare distressing him, that's evident.'\n'Mayn't  I  look  at  him  after  three  years?'  wept\nPulcheria Alexandrovna.", "'Stay,'  he  stopped  them  again,  'you  keep\ninterrupting  me,  and  my  ideas  get  muddled....\nHave you seen Luzhin?'\n'No, Rodya, but he knows already of our arrival.\nWe  have  heard,  Rodya,  that  Pyotr  Petrovitch\nwas  so  kind  as  to  visit  you  today,'  Pulcheria\nAlexandrovna added somewhat timidly.\n'Yes  ...  he  was  so  kind  ...  Dounia,  I  promised\nLuzhin I'd throw him downstairs and told him to\ngo to hell....'\n'Rodya, what are you saying! Surely, you don't\nmean  to  tell  us  ...'  Pulcheria  Alexandrovna\nbegan  in  alarm,  but  she  stopped,  looking  at\nDounia.\nAvdotya  Romanovna  was  looking  attentively \nat    her  brother,  waiting  for  what  would  come\nnext.  Both  of  them  had  heard  of  the  quarrel\nfrom Nastasya, so far as she had succeeded in\nunderstanding  and  reporting  it,  and  were  in\npainful perplexity and suspense.\n'Dounia,' Raskolnikov continued with an effort, 'I\ndon't  want  that  marriage,  so  at  the  first", "opportunity  to-morrow  you  must  refuse  Luzhin,\nso that we may never hear his name again.'\n'Good  Heavens!'  cried  Pulcheria\nAlexandrovna.(cid:24)1  'Brother,  think  what  you  are\nsaying!'  Avdotya  Romanovna  began\nimpetuously,  but  immediately  checked  herself.\n'You  are  not  fit  to  talk  now,  perhaps;  you  are\ntired,' she added gently.\n'You  think  I  am  delirious?  No  ...  You  are\nmarrying Luzhin for my sake. But I won't accept\nthe  sacrifice.  And  so  write  a  letter  before\nto-morrow, to refuse him ... Let me read it in the\nmorning and that will be the end of it!'\n'That  I  can't  do!'  the  girl  cried,  offended,  'what\nright have you ...'\n'Dounia, you are hasty, too, be quiet, to-morrow\n...  Don't  you  see  ...'  the  mother  interposed  in\ndismay. 'Better come away!'\n'He  is  raving,'  Razumihin  cried  tipsily,  'or  how\nwould he dare! To-morrow all this nonsense will\nbe  over  ...  to-day  he  certainly  did  drive  him\naway.  That  was  so.  And  Luzhin  got  angry,", "too.... He made speeches here, wanted to show\noff his learning and he went out crest- fallen....'\n'Then it's true?' cried Pulcheria Alexandrovna.\n'Good-bye  till  to-morrow,  brother,'  said  Dounia\ncompassionately-'let  us  go,  mother  ...\nGood-bye, Rodya.'\n'Do  you  hear,  sister,'  he  repeated  after  them,\nmaking  a  last  effort,  'I  am  not  delirious;  this\nmarriage  is-an  infamy.  Let  me  act  like  a\nscoundrel, but you mustn't ... one is enough ...\nand  though  I  am  a  scoundrel,  I  wouldn't  own\nsuch a sister. It's me or Luzhin! Go now....'\n'But  you're  out  of  your  mind!  Despot!'  roared\nRazumihin;  but  Raskolnikov  did  not  and\nperhaps could not answer. He lay down on the\nsofa, and turned to the wall, utterly (cid:24) exhausted.\nAvdotya  Romanovna  looked  with  interest  at\nRazumihin;  her  black  eyes  flashed;  Razumihin\npositively started at her glance.\nPulcheria Alexandrovna stood overwhelmed.\n'Nothing would induce me to go,' she whispered", "in despair to Razumihin. 'I will stay somewhere\nhere ... escort Dounia home.'\n'You'll spoil everything,' Razumihin answered in\nthe same whisper, losing patience-'come out on\nto the stairs, anyway. Nastasya, show a light! I\nassure you,' he went on in a half whisper on the\nstairs-  'that  he  was  almost  beating  the  doctor\nand me this afternoon! Do you understand? The\ndoctor himself! Even he gave way and left him,\nso as not to irritate him. I remained downstairs\non  guard,  but  he  dressed  at  once  and  slipped\noff. And he will slip off again if you irritate him,\nat  this  time  of  night,  and  will  do  himself  some\nmischief....'\n'What are you saying?'\n'And Avdotya Romanovna can't possibly be left\nin those lodgings without you. Just think where\nyou  are  staying!  That  blackguard  Pyotr\nPetrovitch  couldn't  find  you  better  lodgings  ...\nBut you know I've had a little to drink, and that's\nwhat makes me ... swear; don't mind it....'\n'But  I'll  go  to  the  landlady  here,'  Pulcheria\nAlexandrovna  insisted,  'Ill  beseech  her  to  find", "some corner for Dounia and me for the night. I\ncan't leave him like that, I cannot!'\nThis conversation took place on the landing just\nbefore  the  landlady's  door.  Nastasya  lighted\nthem  from  a  step  below.  Razumihin  was  in\nextraordinary excitement. Half an (cid:24)(cid:24) hour earlier,\nwhile  he  was  bringing  Raskolnikov  home,  he\nhad indeed talked too freely, but he was aware\nof it himself, and his head was clear in spite of\nthe vast quantities he had imbibed. Now he was\nin a state bordering on ecstasy, and all that he\nhad  drunk  seemed  to  fly  to  his  head  with\nredoubled  effect.  He  stood  with  the  two  ladies,\nseizing  both  by  their  hands,  persuading  them,\nand  giving  them  reasons  with  astonishing\nplainness of speech, and at almost every word\nhe  uttered,  probably  to  emphasise  his\narguments,  he  squeezed  their  hands  painfully\nas in a vise. He stared at Avdotya Romanovna\nwithout the least regard for good manners. They\nsometimes  pulled  their  hands  out  of  his  huge\nbony  paws,  but  far  from  noticing  what  was  the\nmatter,  he  drew  them  all  the  closer  to  him.  If\nthey'd told him to jump head foremost from the\nstaircase,  he  would  have  done  it  without\nthought  or  hesitation  in  their  service.  Though", "Pulcheria Alexandrovna felt that the young man\nwas  really  too  eccentric  and  pinched  her  hand\ntoo  much,  in  her  anxiety  over  her  Rodya  she\nlooked on his presence as providential, and was\nunwilling  to  notice  all  his  peculiarities.  But\nthough  Avdotya  Romanovna  shared  her\nanxiety,  and  was  not  of  timorous  disposition,\nshe could not see the glowing light in his eyes\nwithout  wonder  and  almost  alarm.  It  was  only\nthe  unbounded  confidence  inspired  by\nNastasya's  account  of  her  brother's  queer\nfriend,  which  prevented  her  from  trying  to  run\naway from him, and to persuade her mother to\ndo  the  same.  She  realised,  too,  that  even\nrunning away was perhaps impossible now. Ten\nminutes  later,  however,  she  was  considerably\nreassured;  it  was  characteristic  of  Razumihin  (cid:24)\nthat  he  showed  his  true  nature  at  once,\nwhatever  mood  he  might  be  in,  so  that  people\nquickly  saw  the  sort  of  man  they  had  to  deal\nwith.\n'You  can't  go  to  the  landlady,  that's  perfect\nnonsense!' he cried. 'If you stay, though you are\nhis mother, you'll drive him to a frenzy, and then\ngoodness  knows  what  will  happen!  Listen,  I'll\ntell you what I'll do: Nastasya will stay with him", "now, and I'll conduct you both home, you can't\nbe  in  the  streets  alone;  Petersburg  is  an  awful\nplace in that way.... But no matter! Then I'll run\nstraight  back  here  and  a  quarter  of  an  hour\nlater, on my word of honour, I'll bring you news\nhow  he  is,  whether  he  is  asleep,  and  all  that.\nThen,  listen!  Then  I'll  run  home  in  a\ntwinkling-I've  a  lot  of  friends  there,  all  drunk-I'll\nfetch Zossimov-that's the doctor who is looking\nafter him, he is there, too, but he is not drunk;\nhe is not drunk, he is never drunk! I'll drag him\nto Rodya, and then to you, so that you'll get two\nreports  in  the  hour-from  the  doctor,  you\nunderstand,  from  the  doctor  himself,  that's  a\nvery  different  thing  from  my  account  of  him!  If\nthere's  anything  wrong,  I  swear  I'll  bring  you\nhere  myself,  but,  if  it's  all  right,  you  go  to  bed.\nAnd I'll spend the night here, in the passage, he\nwon't hear me, and I'll tell Zossimov to sleep at\nthe landlady's, to be at hand. Which is better for\nhim:  you  or  the  doctor?  So  come  home  then!\nBut  the  landlady  is  out  of  the  question;  it's  all\nright for me, but it's out of the question for you:\nshe  wouldn't  take  you,  for  she's  ...  for  she's  a\nfool  ...  She'd  be  jealous  on  my  account  of\nAvdotya  Romanovna  and  of  you,  too,  if  you\nwant  to  know  ...  of  Avdotya  Romanovna", "certainly.  She  is  an  absolutely,  absolutely\nunaccountable (cid:24)(cid:24) character! But I am a fool, too!\n...  No  matter!  Come  along!  Do  you  trust  me?\nCome, do you trust me or not?'\n'Let  us  go,  mother,'  said  Avdotya  Romanovna,\n'he  will  certainly  do  what  he  has  promised.  He\nhas  saved  Rodya  already,  and  if  the  doctor\nreally will consent to spend the night here, what\ncould be better?'\n'You  see,  you  ...  you  ...  understand  me,\nbecause you are an angel!' Razumihin cried in\necstasy,  'let  us  go!  Nastasya!  Fly  upstairs  and\nsit with him with a light; I'll come in a quarter of\nan hour.'\nThough  Pulcheria  Alexandrovna  was  not\nperfectly  convinced,  she  made  no  further\nresistance. Razumihin gave an arm to each and\ndrew  them  down  the  stairs.  He  still  made  her\nuneasy,  as  though  he  was  competent  and\ngood-natured,  was  he  capable  of  carrying  out\nhis promise? He seemed in such a condition....\n'Ah,  I  see  you  think  I  am  in  such  a  condition!'\nRazumihin  broke  in  upon  her  thoughts,", "guessing  them,  as  he  strolled  along  the\npavement  with  huge  steps,  so  that  the  two\nladies could hardly keep up with him, a fact he\ndid not observe, however. 'Nonsense! That is ...\nI am drunk like a fool, but that's not it; I am not\ndrunk from wine. It's seeing you has turned my\nhead  ...  But  don't  mind  me!  Don't  take  any\nnotice:  I  am  talking  nonsense,  I  am  not  worthy\nof  you....  I  am  utterly  unworthy  of  you!  The\nminute I've taken you home, I'll pour a couple of\npailfuls  of  water  over  my  head  in  the  gutter\nhere, and then I shall be all right.... If only you\nknew  how  I  love  you  both!  Don't  laugh,  and\ndon't be angry! You may be angry with anyone,\nbut not with me! I am his friend, (cid:24) and therefore I\nam  your  friend,  too,  I  want  to  be  ...  I  had  a\npresentiment ... Last year there was a moment\n... though it wasn't a presentiment really, for you\nseem to have fallen from heaven. And I expect I\nshan't sleep all night ... Zossimov was afraid a\nlittle  time  ago  that  he  would  go  mad  ...  that's\nwhy he mustn't be irritated.'\n'What do you say?' cried the mother.\n'Did  the  doctor  really  say  that?'  asked  Avdotya\nRomanovna, alarmed.", "'Yes, but it's not so, not a bit of it. He gave him\nsome  medicine,  a  powder,  I  saw  it,  and  then\nyour  coming  here....  Ah!  It  would  have  been\nbetter  if  you  had  come  to-morrow.  It's  a  good\nthing  we  went  away.  And  in  an  hour  Zossimov\nhimself will report to you about everything. He is\nnot  drunk!  And  I  shan't  be  drunk....  And  what\nmade  me  get  so  tight?  Because  they  got  me\ninto an argument, damn them! I've sworn never\nto argue! They talk such trash! I almost came to\nblows! I've left my uncle to preside. Would you\nbelieve,  they  insist  on  complete  absence  of\nindividualism  and  that's  just  what  they  relish!\nNot  to  be  themselves,  to  be  as  unlike\nthemselves  as  they  can.  That's  what  they\nregard  as  the  highest  point  of  progress.  If  only\ntheir nonsense were their own, but as it is ...'\n'Listen!'    Pulcheria    Alexandrovna    interrupted \ntimidly, but it only added fuel to the flames.\n'What do you think?' shouted Razumihin, louder\nthan  ever,  'you  think  I  am  attacking  them  for\ntalking  nonsense?  Not  a  bit!  I  like  them  to  talk\nnonsense.  That's  man's  one  privilege  over  all\ncreation. Through error you come to the truth! (cid:24)(cid:24)", "I am a man because I err! You never reach any\ntruth without making fourteen mistakes and very\nlikely a hundred and fourteen. And a fine thing,\ntoo, in its way; but we can't even make mistakes\non  our  own  account!  Talk  nonsense,  but  talk\nyour own nonsense, and I'll kiss you for it. To go\nwrong  in  one's  own  way  is  better  than  to  go\nright in someone else's. In the first case you are\na  man,  in  the  second  you're  no  better  than  a\nbird.  Truth  won't  escape  you,  but  life  can  be\ncramped. There have been examples. And what\nare  we  doing  now?  In  science,  development,\nthought,  invention,  ideals,  aims,  liberalism,\njudgment,  experience  and  everything,\neverything,  everything,  we  are  still  in  the\npreparatory class at school. We prefer to live on\nother  people's  ideas,  it's  what  we  are  used  to!\nAm  I  right,  am  I  right?'  cried  Razumihin,\npressing and shaking the two ladies' hands.\n'Oh, mercy, I do not know,' cried poor Pulcheria\nAlexandrovna.\n'Yes,  yes  ...  though  I  don't  agree  with  you  in\neverything,'  added  Avdotya  Romanovna\nearnestly  and  at  once  uttered  a  cry,  for  he\nsqueezed her hand so painfully.", "'Yes, you say yes ... well after that you ... you ...'\nhe  cried  in  a  transport,  'you  are  a  fount  of\ngoodness, purity, sense ... and perfection. Give\nme your hand ... you give me yours, too! I want\nto  kiss  your  hands  here  at  once,  on  my  knees\n...'  and  he  fell  on  his  knees  on  the  pavement,\nfortunately at that time deserted.\n'Leave  off,  I  entreat  you,  what  are  you  doing?'\nPulcheria  Alexandrovna  cried,  greatly\ndistressed.\n'Get  up,  get  up!'  said  Dounia  laughing,  though\nshe, too, (cid:24) was upset.\n'Not for anything till you let me kiss your hands!\nThat's it!

Yes?\nWell,  then,  I'll  tell  you,  your  fiancé  is  a\nscoundrel.'\n'Excuse  me,  Mr.  Razumihin,  you  are  forgetting\n...' Pulcheria Alexandrovna was beginning.\n'Yes, yes, you are right, I did forget myself, I am\nashamed  of  it,'  Razumihin  made  haste  to\napologise.  'But  ...  but  you  can't  be  angry  with\nme  for  speaking  so!  For  I  speak  sincerely  and\nnot  because  ...  hm,  hm!  That  would  be\ndisgraceful;  in  fact  not  because  I'm  in  ...  hm!\nWell,  anyway,  I  won't  say  why,  I  daren't....  But\nwe  all  saw  to-day  when  he  came  in  that  that\nman is not of our sort. Not because he had his\nhair curled at the barber's, not because he was\nin such a hurry to show his wit, but because he\nis a spy, a speculator, because he is a skinflint\nand a buffoon. That's evident. Do you think him\nclever?  No,  he  is  a  fool,  a  fool.  And  is  he  a\nmatch  for  you?  Good  heavens!  Do  you  see,\nladies?'  he  stopped  suddenly  on  the  way\nupstairs  to  their  rooms,  'though  all  my  friends\nthere  are  drunk,  yet  they  are  all  honest,  and\nthough we do talk a lot of trash, and I do, too,\nyet  we  shall  talk  our  way  to  the  truth  (cid:24)(cid:24)  at  last,", "for  we  are  on  the  right  path,  while  Pyotr\nPetrovitch  ...  is  not  on  the  right  path.  Though\nI've  been  calling  them  all  sorts  of  names  just\nnow,  I  do  respect  them  all  ...  though  I  don't\nrespect  Zametov,  I  like  him,  for  he  is  a  puppy,\nand  that  bullock  Zossimov,  because  he  is  an\nhonest  man  and  knows  his  work.  But  enough,\nit's  all  said  and  forgiven.  Is  it  forgiven?  Well,\nthen, let's go on. I know this corridor, I've been\nhere, there was a scandal here at Number 3....\nWhere  are  you  here?  Which  number?  eight?\nWell, lock yourselves in for the night, then. Don't\nlet anybody in. In a quarter of an hour I'll come\nback with news, and half an hour later I'll bring\nZossimov, you'll see! Good- bye, I'll run.'\n'Good  heavens,  Dounia,  what  is  going  to\nhappen?'  said  Pulcheria    Alexandrovna, \naddressing    her    daughter    with  anxiety  and\ndismay.\n'Don't  worry  yourself,  mother,'  said  Dounia,\ntaking off her hat and cape. 'God has sent this\ngentleman to our aid, though he has come from\na  drinking  party.  We  can  depend  on  him,  I\nassure  you.  And  all  that  he  has  done  for\nRodya....'", "'Ah.  Dounia,  goodness  knows  whether  he  will\ncome!  How  could  I  bring  myself  to  leave\nRodya?  ...  And  how  different,  how  different  I\nhad fancied our meeting! How sullen he was, as\nthough not pleased to see us....'\nTears came into her eyes.\n'No,  it's  not  that,  mother.  You  didn't  see,  you\nwere crying all the time. He is quite unhinged by\nserious illness-that's the reason.'\n'Ah,  that  illness!  What  will  happen,  what  will\nhappen? (cid:24)(cid:24)0 Crime and Punishment And how he\ntalked to you, Dounia!' said the mother, looking\ntimidly  at  her  daughter,  trying  to  read  her\nthoughts and, already half consoled by Dounia's\nstanding  up  for  her  brother,  which  meant  that\nshe had already forgiven him. 'I am sure he will\nthink better of it to-morrow,' she added, probing\nher further.\n'And  I  am  sure  that  he  will  say  the  same\nto-morrow  ...  about  that,'  Avdotya  Romanovna\nsaid finally. And, of course, there was no going\nbeyond  that,  for  this  was  a  point  which", "Pulcheria  Alexandrovna  was  afraid  to  discuss.\nDounia  went  up  and  kissed  her  mother.  The\nlatter  warmly  embraced  her  without  speaking.\nThen she sat down to wait anxiously for \nRazumihin's  return,  timidly  watching  her\ndaughter  who  walked  up  and  down  the  room\nwith  her  arms  folded,  lost  in  thought.  This\nwalking  up  and  down  when  she  was  thinking\nwas  a  habit  of  Avdotya  Romanovna's  and  the\nmother  was  always  afraid  to  break  in  on  her\ndaughter's mood at such moments.\nRazumihin,  of  course,  was  ridiculous  in  his\nsudden  drunken  infatuation  for  Avdotya\nRomanovna.  Yet  apart  from  his  eccentric\ncondition,  many  people  would  have  thought  it\njustified  if  they  had  seen  Avdotya  Romanovna,\nespecially  at  that  moment  when  she  was\nwalking  to  and  fro  with  folded  arms,  pensive\nand  melancholy.  Avdotya  Romanovna  was\nremarkably good looking; she was tall, strikingly\nwell-proportioned,  strong  and  self-reliant-the\nlatter  quality  was  apparent  in  every  gesture,\nthough  it  did  not  in  the  least  detract  from  the\ngrace  and  softness  of  her  movements.  In  face\nshe resembled her brother, but (cid:24)1 she might be", "described as really beautiful. Her hair was dark\nbrown,  a  little  lighter  than  her  brother's;  there\nwas a proud light in her almost black eyes and\nyet  at  times  a  look  of  extraordinary  kindness.\nShe  was  pale,  but  it  was  a  healthy  pallor;  her\nface was radiant with freshness and vigour. Her\nmouth  was  rather  small;  the  full  red  lower  lip\nprojected a little as did her chin; it was the only\nirregularity in her beautiful face, but it gave it a\npeculiarly  individual  and  almost  haughty\nexpression. Her face was always more serious\nand  thoughtful  than  gay;  but  how  well  smiles,\nhow  well  youthful,  lighthearted,  irresponsible,\nlaughter suited her face! It was natural enough\nthat a warm, open, simplehearted, honest giant\nlike  Razumihin,  who  had  never  seen  anyone\nlike  her  and  was  not  quite  sober  at  the  time,\nshould  lose  his  head  immediately.  Besides,  as\nchance  would  have  it,  he  saw  Dounia  for  the\nfirst time transfigured by her love for her brother\nand her joy at meeting him. Afterwards he saw\nher  lower  lip  quiver  with  indignation  at  her\nbrother's  insolent,  cruel  and  ungrateful\nwords-and his fate was sealed.\nHe  had  spoken  the  truth,  moreover,  when  he\nblurted out in his drunken talk on the stairs that", "Praskovya  Pavlovna,  Raskolnikov's  eccentric\nlandlady,  would  be  jealous  of  Pulcheria\nAlexandrovna  as  well  as  of  Avdotya\nRomanovna on his account. Although Pulcheria\nAlexandrovna  was  fortythree,  her  face  still\nretained traces of her former beauty; she looked\nmuch  younger  than  her  age,  indeed,  which  is\nalmost always the case with women who retain\nserenity of spirit, sensitiveness and pure sincere\nwarmth  of  heart  to  old  age.  We  may  add  in\nparenthesis that to preserve all this is the (cid:24) only\nmeans  of  retaining  beauty  to  old  age.  Her  hair\nhad begun to grow grey and thin, there had long\nbeen  little  crow's  foot  wrinkles  round  her  eyes,\nher  cheeks  were  hollow  and  sunken  from\nanxiety  and  grief,  and  yet  it  was  a  handsome\nface. She was Dounia over again, twenty years\nolder,  but  without  the  projecting  underlip.\nPulcheria Alexandrovna was emotional, but not\nsentimental,  timid  and  yielding,  but  only  to  a\ncertain point. She could give way and accept a\ngreat  deal  even  of  what  was  contrary  to  her\nconvictions, but there was a certain barrier fixed\nby  honesty,  principle  and  the  deepest\nconvictions  which  nothing  would  induce  her  to\ncross.", "Exactly  twenty  minutes  after  Razumihin's\ndeparture, there came two subdued but hurried\nknocks at the door: he had come back.\n'I won't come in, I haven't time,' he hastened to\nsay when the door was opened. 'He sleeps like\na  top,  soundly,  quietly,  and  God  grant  he  may\nsleep ten hours. Nastasya's with him; I told her\nnot  to  leave  till  I  came.  Now  I  am  fetching\nZossimov,  he  will  report  to  you  and  then  you'd\nbetter turn in; I can see you are too tired to do\nanything....'\nAnd he ran off down the corridor.\n'What  a  very  competent  and  ...  devoted  young\nman!' cried Pulcheria Alexandrovna exceedingly\ndelighted.\n'He  seems  a  splendid  person!'  Avdotya\nRomanovna  replied  with  some  warmth,\nresuming her walk up and down the room.\nIt  was  nearly  an  hour  later  when  they  heard\nfootsteps  in  the  corridor  and  another  knock  at\nthe  door.  Both  wom-(cid:24)(cid:24)  en  waited  this  time\ncompletely  relying  on  Razumihin's  promise;  he", "actually  had  succeeded  in  bringing  Zossimov.\nZossimov  had  agreed  at  once  to  desert  the\ndrinking  party  to  go  to  Raskolnikov's,  but  he\ncame reluctantly and with the greatest suspicion\nto  see  the  ladies,  mistrusting  Razumihin  in  his\nexhilarated condition. But his vanity was at once\nreassured and flattered; he saw that they were\nreally  expecting  him  as  an  oracle.  He  stayed\njust  ten  minutes  and  succeeded  in  completely\nconvincing  and  comforting  Pulcheria\nAlexandrovna.  He  spoke  with  marked\nsympathy,  but  with  the  reserve  and  extreme\nseriousness  of  a  young  doctor  at  an  important\nconsultation.  He  did  not  utter  a  word  on  any\nother  subject  and  did  not  display  the  slightest\ndesire to enter into more personal relations with\nthe  two  ladies.  Remarking  at  his  first  entrance\nthe dazzling beauty of Avdotya Romanovna, he\nendeavoured  not  to  notice  her  at  all  during  his\nvisit  and  addressed  himself  solely  to  Pulcheria\nAlexandrovna.  All  this  gave  him  extraordinary\ninward satisfaction. He declared that he thought\nthe  invalid  at  this  moment  going  on  very\nsatisfactorily. According to his observations the\npatient's  illness  was  due  partly  to  his\nunfortunate  material  surroundings  during  the\nlast  few  months,  but  it  had  partly  also  a  moral", "origin, 'was, so to speak, the product of several\nmaterial  and  moral  influences,  anxieties,\napprehensions, troubles, certain ideas ... and so\non.' Noticing stealthily that Avdotya Romanovna\nwas  following  his  words  with  close  attention,\nZossimov  allowed  himself  to  enlarge  on  this\ntheme.  On  Pulcheria  Alexandrovna's  anxiously\nand  timidly  inquiring  as  to  'some  suspicion  of\ninsanity,'  he  replied  with  (cid:24)  a  composed  and\ncandid  smile  that  his  words  had  been\nexaggerated;  that  certainly  the  patient  had\nsome  fixed  idea,  something  approaching  a\nmonomania-he, Zossimov, was now particularly\nstudying this interesting branch of medicine-but\nthat  it  must  be  recollected  that  until  to-day  the\npatient had been in delirium and ... and that no\ndoubt  the  presence  of  his  family  would  have  a\nfavourable  effect  on  his  recovery  and  distract\nhis  mind,  'if  only  all  fresh  shocks  can  be\navoided,'  he  added  significantly.  Then  he  got\nup,  took  leave  with  an  impressive  and  affable\nbow,  while  blessings,  warm  gratitude,  and\nentreaties  were  showered  upon  him,  and\nAvdotya Romanovna spontaneously offered her\nhand  to  him.  He  went  out  exceedingly  pleased\nwith his visit and still more so with himself.", "'We'll  talk  to-morrow;  go  to  bed  at  once!'\nRazumihin  said  in  conclusion,  following\nZossimov  out.  'I'll  be  with  you  to-morrow\nmorning as early as possible with my report.'\n'That's  a  fetching  little  girl,  Avdotya\nRomanovna,'  remarked  Zossimov,  almost\nlicking  his  lips  as  they  both  came  out  into  the\nstreet.\n'Fetching?  You  said  fetching?'  roared\nRazumihin and he flew at Zossimov and seized\nhim  by  the  throat.  'If  you  ever  dare....  Do  you\nunderstand?  Do  you  understand?'  he  shouted,\nshaking  him  by  the  collar  and  squeezing  him\nagainst the wall. 'Do you hear?'\n'Let  me  go,  you  drunken  devil,'  said  Zossimov,\nstruggling  and  when  he  had  let  him  go,  he\nstared at him and went off into a sudden guffaw.\nRazumihin  stood  facing  him  in  gloomy  and\nearnest reflection.(cid:24)(cid:24) 'Of course, I am an ass,' he\nobserved, sombre as a storm cloud, 'but still ...\nyou are another.'\n'No,  brother,  not  at  all  such  another.  I  am  not\ndreaming of any folly.'", "They  walked  along  in  silence  and  only  when\nthey  were  close  to  Raskolnikov's  lodgings,\nRazumihin  broke  the  silence  in  considerable\nanxiety.\n'Listen,'  he  said,  'you're  a  first-rate  fellow,  but\namong  your  other  failings,  you're  a  loose  fish,\nthat  I  know,  and  a  dirty  one,  too.

She's\nmost  prepossessing  ...  I'll  repay  you,  I'll  do\nanything....'\nZossimov laughed more violently than ever.\n'Well, you are smitten!

He  found  himself\nconfronted  with  many  new  and  unlooked-for\nperplexities.  He  had  never  expected  that  he\nwould  ever  wake  up  feeling  like  that.  He\nremembered  every  detail  of  the  previous  day\nand  he  knew  that  a  perfectly  novel  experience\nhad  befallen  him,  that  he  had  received  an\nimpression  unlike  anything  he  had  known\nbefore. At the same time he recognised clearly\nthat  the  dream  which  had  fired  his  imagination\nwas  hopelessly  unattainable-so  unattainable\nthat  he  felt  positively  ashamed  of  it,  and  he\nhastened  to  pass  to  the  other  more  practical\ncares  and  difficulties  bequeathed  him  by  that\n'thrice accursed yesterday.'\nThe most awful recollection of the previous day\nwas  the  way  he  had  shown  himself  'base  and\nmean,'  not  only  because  he  had  been  drunk,\nbut  because  he  had  taken  advantage  of  the", "young  girl's  position  to  abuse  her  fiancé  in  his\nstupid jealousy, knowing nothing of their mutual\nrelations and obligations and next to nothing of\nthe  man  himself.  And  what  right  had  he  to\ncriticise  him  in  that  hasty  and  unguarded\nmanner? Who had asked for his opinion? Was it\nthinkable  that  such  a  creature  as  Avdotya\nRomanovna  would  be  marrying  an  unworthy\nman for money? So there must be something in\nhim. The lodgings? But after all how could he (cid:24)(cid:24)\nknow  the  character  of  the  lodgings?  He  was\nfurnishing  a  flat  ...  Foo!  how  despicable  it  all\nwas!  And  what  justification  was  it  that  he  was\ndrunk?  Such  a  stupid  excuse  was  even  more\ndegrading! In wine is truth, and the truth had all\ncome  out,  'that  is,  all  the  uncleanness  of  his\ncoarse  and  envious  heart'!  And  would  such  a\ndream ever be permissible to him, Razumihin?\nWhat was he beside such a girl-he, the drunken\nnoisy braggart of last night? Was it possible to\nimagine so absurd and cynical a juxtaposition?\nRazumihin blushed desperately at the very idea\nand  suddenly  the  recollection  forced  itself\nvividly  upon  him  of  how  he  had  said  last  night\non the stairs that the landlady would be jealous\nof  Avdotya  Romanovna  ...  that  was  simply\nintolerable. He brought his fist down heavily on", "the kitchen stove, hurt his hand and sent one of\nthe bricks flying.\n'Of  course,'  he  muttered  to  himself  a  minute\nlater  with  a  feeling  of  self-abasement,  'of\ncourse,  all  these  infamies  can  never  be  wiped\nout  or  smoothed  over  ...  and  so  it's  useless\neven  to  think  of  it,  and  I  must  go  to  them  in\nsilence and do my duty ... in silence, too ... and\nnot ask forgiveness, and say nothing ... for all is\nlost now!'\nAnd  yet  as  he  dressed  he  examined  his  attire\nmore  carefully  than  usual.  He  hadn't  another\nsuit-if he had had, perhaps he wouldn't have put\nit on. 'I would have made a point of not putting it\non.' But in any case he could not remain a cynic\nand a dirty sloven; he had no right to offend the\nfeelings of others, especially when they were in\nneed  of  his  assistance  and  asking  him  to  see\nthem.  He  brushed  his  clothes  carefully.  His\nlinen  was  always  decent;  in  that  re(cid:24)00  Crime\nand Punishment spect he was especially clean.\nHe  washed  that  morning  scrupulously-he  got\nsome soap from Nastasya- he washed his hair,\nhis  neck  and  especially  his  hands.

Why,  I  know\none  case  in  which  a  hypochondriac,  a  man  of\nforty, cut the (cid:24)0(cid:24) Crime and Punishment throat of\na little boy of eight, because he couldn't endure\nthe  jokes  he  made  every  day  at  table!  And  in\nthis case his rags, the insolent police officer, the\nfever and this suspicion! All that working upon a\nman half frantic with hypochondria, and with his", "morbid  exceptional  vanity!  That  may  well  have\nbeen the starting-point of illness. Well, bother it\nall! ... And, by the way, that Zametov certainly is\na  nice  fellow,  but  hm  ...  he  shouldn't  have  told\nall that last night. He is an awful chatterbox!'\n'But whom did he tell it to? You and me?'\n'And Porfiry.'\n'What does that matter?'\n'And,  by  the  way,  have  you  any  influence  on\nthem,  his  mother  and  sister?  Tell  them  to  be\nmore careful with him to-day....'\n'They'll  get  on  all  right!'  Razumihin  answered\nreluctantly.\n'Why  is  he  so  set  against  this  Luzhin?  A  man\nwith money and she doesn't seem to dislike him\n... and they haven't a farthing, I suppose? eh?'\n'But  what  business  is  it  of  yours?'  Razumihin\ncried  with  annoyance.  'How  can  I  tell  whether\nthey've  a  farthing?  Ask  them  yourself  and\nperhaps you'll find out....'", "'Foo!  what  an  ass  you  are  sometimes!  Last\nnight's  wine  has  not  gone  off  yet....  Good-bye;\nthank your Praskovya Pavlovna from me for my\nnight's lodging. She locked herself in, made no\nreply  to  my  bonjour  through  the  door;  she  was\nup at seven o'clock, the samovar was taken into\nher  from  the  kitchen.  I  was  not  vouchsafed  a\npersonal interview....'0(cid:24) At nine o'clock precisely\nRazumihin reached the lodgings at Bakaleyev's\nhouse.  Both  ladies  were  waiting  for  him  with\nnervous  impatience.  They  had  risen  at  seven\no'clock  or  earlier.  He  entered  looking  as  black\nas  night,  bowed  awkwardly  and  was  at  once\nfurious  with  himself  for  it.  He  had  reckoned\nwithout  his  host:  Pulcheria  Alexandrovna  fairly\nrushed  at  him,  seized  him  by  both  hands  and\nwas almost kissing them. He glanced timidly at\nAvdotya  Romanovna,  but  her  proud\ncountenance  wore  at  that  moment  an\nexpression  of  such  gratitude  and  friendliness,\nsuch  complete  and  unlooked-for  respect  (in\nplace  of  the  sneering  looks  and  illdisguised\ncontempt  he  had  expected),  that  it  threw  him\ninto greater confusion than if he had been met\nwith abuse. Fortunately there was a subject for\nconversation, and he made haste to snatch at it.", "Hearing that everything was going well and that\nRodya  had  not  yet  waked,  Pulcheria\nAlexandrovna  declared  that  she  was  glad  to\nhear  it,  because  'she  had  something  which  it\nwas  very,  very  necessary  to  talk  over\nbeforehand.'  Then  followed  an  inquiry  about\nbreakfast and an invitation to have it with them;\nthey  had  waited  to  have  it  with  him.  Avdotya\nRomanovna rang the bell: it was answered by a\nragged dirty waiter, and they asked him to bring\ntea which was served at last, but in such a dirty\nand  disorderly  way  that  the  ladies  were\nashamed.  Razumihin  vigorously  attacked  the\nlodgings,  but,  remembering  Luzhin,  stopped  in\nembarrassment  and  was  greatly  relieved  by\nPulcheria  Alexandrovna's  questions,  which\nshowered in a continual stream upon him.\nHe  talked  for  three  quarters  of  an  hour,  being\nconstantly  (cid:24)0(cid:24)  Crime  and  Punishment\ninterrupted by their questions, and succeeded in\ndescribing  to  them  all  the  most  important  facts\nhe  knew  of  the  last  year  of  Raskolnikov's  life,\nconcluding  with  a  circumstantial  account  of  his\nillness.  He  omitted,  however,  many  things,\nwhich  were  better  omitted,  including  the  scene", "at  the  police  station  with  all  its  consequences.\nThey listened eagerly to his story, and, when he\nthought  he  had  finished  and  satisfied  his\nlisteners, he found that they considered he had\nhardly begun.\n'Tell me, tell me! What do you think ... ? Excuse\nme,  I  still  don't  know  your  name!'  Pulcheria\nAlexandrovna put in hastily.\n'Dmitri Prokofitch.'\n'I  should  like  very,  very  much  to  know,  Dmitri\nProkofitch  ...  how  he  looks  ...  on  things  in\ngeneral  now,  that  is,  how  can  I  explain,  what\nare  his  likes  and  dislikes?  Is  he  always  so\nirritable? Tell me, if you can, what are his hopes\nand,  so  to  say,  his  dreams?  Under  what\ninfluences is he now? In a word, I should like ...'\n'Ah,  mother,  how  can  he  answer  all  that  at\nonce?' observed Dounia.\n'Good heavens, I had not expected to find him\nin the least like this, Dmitri Prokofitch!'\n'Naturally,'  answered  Razumihin.  'I  have  no", "mother,  but  my  uncle  comes  every  year  and\nalmost  every  time  he  can  scarcely  recognise\nme, even in appearance, though he is a clever\nman; and your three years' separation means a\ngreat deal. What am I to tell you? I have known\nRodion  for  a  year  and  a  half;  he  is  morose,\ngloomy,  proud  and  haughty,  and  0(cid:24)  of  late-and\nperhaps  for  a  long  time  before-he  has  been\nsuspicious  and  fanciful.  He  has  a  noble  nature\nand a kind heart. He does not like showing his\nfeelings and would rather do a cruel thing than\nopen his heart freely. Sometimes, though, he is\nnot at all morbid, but simply cold and inhumanly\ncallous;  it's  as  though  he  were  alternating\nbetween  two  characters.  Sometimes  he  is\nfearfully  reserved!  He  says  he  is  so  busy  that\neverything is a hindrance, and yet he lies in bed\ndoing  nothing.  He  doesn't  jeer  at  things,  not\nbecause  he  hasn't  the  wit,  but  as  though  he\nhadn't  time  to  waste  on  such  trifles.  He  never\nlistens  to  what  is  said  to  him.  He  is  never\ninterested in what interests other people at any\ngiven moment. He thinks very highly of himself\nand  perhaps  he  is  right.  Well,  what  more?  I\nthink  your  arrival  will  have  a  most  beneficial\ninfluence upon him.'", "'God  grant  it  may,'  cried  Pulcheria\nAlexandrovna,  distressed  by  Razumihin's\naccount of her Rodya.\nAnd Razumihin ventured to look more boldly at\nAvdotya Romanovna at last. He glanced at her\noften  while  he  was  talking,  but  only  for  a\nmoment  and  looked  away  again  at  once.\nAvdotya  Romanovna  sat  at  the  table,  listening\nattentively,  then  got  up  again  and  began\nwalking to and fro with her arms folded and her\nlips  compressed,  occasionally  putting  in  a\nquestion,  without  stopping  her  walk.  She  had\nthe same habit of not listening to what was said.\nShe was wearing a dress of thin dark stuff and\nshe  had  a  white  transparent  scarf  round  her\nneck.  Razumihin  soon  detected  signs  of\nextreme  poverty  in  their  belongings.  Had\nAvdotya  Romanovna  been  dressed  like  a\nqueen, he felt that (cid:24)0(cid:24) Crime and Punishment he\nwould  not  be  afraid  of  her,  but  perhaps  just\nbecause  she  was  poorly  dressed  and  that  he\nnoticed  all  the  misery  of  her  surroundings,  his\nheart was filled with dread and he began to be\nafraid  of  every  word  he  uttered,  every  gesture\nhe made, which was very trying for a man who\nalready felt diffident.", "'You've  told  us  a  great  deal  that  is  interesting\nabout my brother's character ... and have told it\nimpartially.  I  am  glad.  I  thought  that  you  were\ntoo  uncritically  devoted  to  him,'  observed\nAvdotya  Romanovna  with  a  smile.  'I  think  you\nare  right  that  he  needs  a  woman's  care,'  she\nadded thoughtfully.\n'I didn't say so; but I daresay you are right, only\n...'\n'What?'\n'He  loves  no  one  and  perhaps  he  never  will,'\nRazumihin declared decisively.\n'You mean he is not capable of love?'\n'Do  you  know,  Avdotya  Romanovna,  you  are\nawfully like your brother, in everything, indeed!'\nhe blurted out suddenly to his own surprise, but\nremembering  at  once  what  he  had  just  before\nsaid of her brother, he turned as red as a crab\nand  was  overcome  with  confusion.  Avdotya\nRomanovna  couldn't  help  laughing  when  she\nlooked at him.", "'You  may  both  be  mistaken  about  Rodya,'\nPulcheria  Alexandrovna  remarked,  slightly\npiqued. 'I am not talking of our present difficulty,\nDounia.  What  Pyotr  Petrovitch  writes  in  this\nletter  and  what  you  and  I  have  supposed  may\nbe  mistaken,  but  you  can't  imagine,  Dmitri\nProkofitch,  how  moody  and,  so  to  say,\ncapricious he is. I never could depend on what\nhe would do when he was only fifteen. And I 0(cid:24)\nam  sure  that  he  might  do  something  now  that\nnobody  else  would  think  of  doing  ...  Well,  for\ninstance,  do  you  know  how  a  year  and  a  half\nago  he  astounded  me  and  gave  me  a  shock\nthat  nearly  killed  me,  when  he  had  the  idea  of\nmarrying  that  girl-what  was  her  name-his\nlandlady's daughter?'\n'Did you hear about that affair?' asked Avdotya\nRomanovna.\n'Do  you  suppose--'  Pulcheria  Alexandrovna\ncontinued  warmly.  'Do  you  suppose  that  my\ntears,  my  entreaties,  my  illness,  my  possible\ndeath from grief, our poverty would have made\nhim  pause?  No,  he  would  calmly  have\ndisregarded all obstacles. And yet it isn't that he", "doesn't love us!'\n'He  has  never  spoken  a  word  of  that  affair  to\nme,' Razumihin answered cautiously. 'But I did\nhear  something  from  Praskovya  Pavlovna\nherself,  though  she  is  by  no  means  a  gossip.\nAnd what I heard certainly was rather strange.'\n'And what did you hear?' both the ladies asked\nat once.\n'Well,  nothing  very  special.  I  only  learned  that\nthe  marriage,  which  only  failed  to  take  place\nthrough  the  girl's  death,  was  not  at  all  to\nPraskovya Pavlovna's liking. They say, too, the\ngirl  was  not  at  all  pretty,  in  fact  I  am  told\npositively  ugly  ...  and  such  an  invalid  ...  and\nqueer. But she seems to have had some good\nqualities.  She  must  have  had  some  good\nqualities or it's quite inexplicable.... She had no\nmoney either and he wouldn't have considered\nher money.... But it's always difficult to judge in\nsuch matters.'\n'I  am  sure  she  was  a  good  girl,'  Avdotya\nRomanovna observed briefly.", "'God forgive me, I simply rejoiced at her death.\nThough I (cid:24)0(cid:24) Crime and Punishment don't know\nwhich of them would have caused most misery\nto the other-he to her or she to him,' Pulcheria\nAlexandrovna  concluded.  Then  she  began\ntentatively  questioning  him  about  the  scene  on\nthe  previous  day  with  Luzhin,  hesitating  and\ncontinually glancing at Dounia, obviously to the\nlatter's  annoyance.  This  incident  more  than  all\nthe rest evidently caused her uneasiness, even\nconsternation.  Razumihin  described  it  in  detail\nagain,  but  this  time  he  added  his  own\nconclusions: he openly blamed Raskolnikov for\nintentionally  insulting  Pyotr  Petrovitch,  not\nseeking  to  excuse  him  on  the  score  of  his\nillness.\n'He had planned it before his illness,' he added.\n'I think so, too,' Pulcheria Alexandrovna agreed\nwith  a  dejected  air.  But  she  was  very  much\nsurprised at hearing Razumihin express himself\nso  carefully  and  even  with  a  certain  respect\nabout  Pyotr  Petrovitch.  Avdotya  Romanovna,\ntoo, was struck by it.\n'So  this  is  your  opinion  of  Pyotr  Petrovitch?'", "Pulcheria Alexandrovna could not resist asking.\n'I can have no other opinion of your daughter's\nfuture  husband,'  Razumihin  answered  firmly\nand with warmth, 'and I don't say it simply from\nvulgar  politeness,  but  because  ...  simply\nbecause  Avdotya  Romanovna  has  of  her  own\nfree  will  deigned  to  accept  this  man.  If  I  spoke\nso rudely of him last night, it was because I was\ndisgustingly  drunk  and  ...  mad  besides;  yes,\nmad,  crazy,  I  lost  my  head  completely  ...  and\nthis morning I am ashamed of it.'\nHe  crimsoned  and  ceased  speaking.  Avdotya\nRomanovna  flushed,  but  did  not  break  the\nsilence. She had not uttered 0(cid:24) a word from the\nmoment they began to speak of Luzhin.\nWithout  her  support  Pulcheria  Alexandrovna\nobviously  did  not  know  what  to  do.  At  last,\nfaltering  and  continually  glancing  at  her\ndaughter,  she  confessed  that  she  was\nexceedingly worried by one circumstance.\n'You  see,  Dmitri  Prokofitch,'  she  began.  'I'll  be\nperfectly open with Dmitri Prokofitch, Dounia?'", "'Of  course,  mother,'  said  Avdotya  Romanovna\nemphatically.\n'This  is  what  it  is,'  she  began  in  haste,  as\nthough  the  permission  to  speak  of  her  trouble\nlifted  a  weight  off  her  mind.  'Very  early  this\nmorning we got a note from Pyotr Petrovitch in\nreply  to  our  letter  announcing  our  arrival.  He\npromised  to  meet  us  at  the  station,  you  know;\ninstead of that he sent a servant to bring us the\naddress  of  these  lodgings  and  to  show  us  the\nway; and he sent a message that he would be\nhere himself this morning. But this morning this\nnote  came  from  him.  You'd  better  read  it\nyourself;  there  is  one  point  in  it  which  worries\nme very much ... you will soon see what that is,\nand  ...  tell  me  your  candid  opinion,  Dmitri\nProkofitch!  You  know  Rodya's  character  better\nthan  anyone  and  no  one  can  advise  us  better\nthan you can. Dounia, I must tell you, made her\ndecision at once, but I still don't feel sure how to\nact and I ... I've been waiting for your opinion.'\nRazumihin  opened  the  note  which  was  dated\nthe previous evening and read as follows:\n'Dear  Madam,  Pulcheria  Alexandrovna,  I  have", "the  honour  to  inform  you  that  owing  to\nunforeseen  obstacles  I  was  (cid:24)10  Crime  and\nPunishment rendered unable to meet you at the\nrailway station; I sent a very competent person\nwith the same object in view. I likewise shall be\ndeprived of the honour of an interview with you\nto-morrow  morning  by  business  in  the  Senate\nthat does not admit of delay, and also that I may\nnot  intrude  on  your  family  circle  while  you  are\nmeeting your son, and Avdotya Romanovna her\nbrother.  I  shall  have  the  honour  of  visiting  you\nand  paying  you  my  respects  at  your  lodgings\nnot later than to-morrow evening at eight o'clock\nprecisely, and herewith I venture to present my\nearnest and, I may add, imperative request that\nRodion Romanovitch may not be present at our\ninterview-as  he  offered  me  a  gross  and\nunprecedented  affront  on  the  occasion  of  my\nvisit  to  him  in  his  illness  yesterday,  and,\nmoreover, since I desire from you personally an\nindispensable  and  circumstantial  explanation\nupon a certain point, in regard to which I wish to\nlearn your own interpretation. I have the honour\nto inform you, in anticipation, that if, in spite of\nmy request, I meet Rodion Romanovitch, I shall\nbe compelled to withdraw immediately and then\nyou have only yourself to blame. I write on the", "assumption  that  Rodion  Romanovitch  who\nappeared so ill at my visit, suddenly recovered\ntwo hours later and so, being able to leave the\nhouse,  may  visit  you  also.  I  was  confirmed  in\nthat  belief  by  the  testimony  of  my  own  eyes  in\nthe lodging of a drunken man who was run over\nand has since died, to whose daughter, a young\nwoman  of  notorious  behaviour,  he  gave\ntwenty-five roubles on the pretext of the funeral,\nwhich gravely surprised me knowing what pains\nyou  were  at  to  raise  that  sum.  Herewith\nexpressing  11  my  special  respect  to  your\nestimable daughter, Avdotya Romanovna, I beg\nyou to accept the respectful homage of\n'Your humble servant,\n'P. LUZHIN.'\n'What am I to do now, Dmitri Prokofitch?' began\nPulcheria  Alexandrovna,  almost  weeping.  'How\ncan  I  ask  Rodya  not  to  come?  Yesterday  he\ninsisted  so  earnestly  on  our  refusing  Pyotr\nPetrovitch  and  now  we  are  ordered  not  to\nreceive  Rodya!  He  will  come  on  purpose  if  he\nknows, and ... what will happen then?'", "'Act  on  Avdotya  Romanovna's  decision,'\nRazumihin answered calmly at once.\n'Oh,  dear  me!  She  says  ...  goodness  knows\nwhat  she  says,  she  doesn't  explain  her  object!\nShe says that it would be best, at least, not that\nit  would  be  best,  but  that  it's  absolutely\nnecessary  that  Rodya  should  make  a  point  of\nbeing  here  at  eight  o'clock  and  that  they  must\nmeet....  I  didn't  want  even  to  show  him  the\nletter, but to prevent him from coming by some\nstratagem  with  your  help  ...  because  he  is  so\nirritable.... Besides I don't understand about that\ndrunkard who died and that daughter, and how\nhe could have given the daughter all the money\n... which ...'\n'Which  cost  you  such  sacrifice,  mother,'  put  in\nAvdotya Romanovna.\n'He was not himself yesterday,' Razumihin said\nthoughtfully, 'if you only knew what he was up to\nin  a  restaurant  yesterday,  though  there  was\nsense in it too.... Hm! He did say something, as\nwe were going home yesterday evening, about\na dead man and a girl, but I didn't understand a\n(cid:24)1(cid:24)  Crime  and  Punishment  word....  But  last", "night, I myself ...'\n'The  best  thing,  mother,  will  be  for  us  to  go  to\nhim  ourselves  and  there  I  assure  you  we  shall\nsee  at  once  what's  to  be  done.  Besides,  it's\ngetting  late-good  heavens,  it's  past  ten,'  she\ncried  looking  at  a  splendid  gold  enamelled\nwatch  which  hung  round  her  neck  on  a  thin\nVenetian  chain,  and  looked  entirely  out  of\nkeeping  with  the  rest  of  her  dress.  'A  present\nfrom her fiancé ' thought Razumihin.\n'We  must  start,  Dounia,  we  must  start,'  her\nmother cried in a flutter. 'He will be thinking we\nare still angry after yesterday, from our coming\nso late. Merciful heavens!'\nWhile she said this she was hurriedly putting on\nher  hat  and  mantle;  Dounia,  too,  put  on  her\nthings. Her gloves, as Razumihin noticed, were\nnot  merely  shabby  but  had  holes  in  them,  and\nyet this evident poverty gave the two ladies an\nair  of  special  dignity,  which  is  always  found  in\npeople  who  know  how  to  wear  poor  clothes.\nRazumihin looked reverently at Dounia and felt\nproud of escorting her. 'The queen who mended\nher stockings in prison,' he thought, 'must have", "looked then every inch a queen and even more\na  queen  than  at  sumptuous  banquets  and\nlevées.'\n'My  God!'  exclaimed  Pulcheria  Alexandrovna,\n'little did I think that I should ever fear seeing my\nson,  my  darling,  darling  Rodya!  I  am  afraid,\nDmitri  Prokofitch,'  she  added,  glancing  at  him\ntimidly.\n'Don't  be  afraid,  mother,'  said  Dounia,  kissing\nher, 'better have faith in him.'\n'Oh, dear, I have faith in him, but I haven't slept\nall  night,'  exclaimed  the  poor  woman.1(cid:24)  They\ncame out into the street.\n'Do you know, Dounia, when I dozed a little this\nmorning  I  dreamed  of  Marfa  Petrovna  ...  she\nwas all in white ... she came up to me, took my\nhand, and shook her head at me, but so sternly\nas  though  she  were  blaming  me....  Is  that  a\ngood  omen?  Oh,  dear  me!  You  don't  know,\nDmitri Prokofitch, that Marfa Petrovna's dead!'\n'No, I didn't know; who is Marfa Petrovna?'", "'She died suddenly; and only fancy ...'\n'Afterwards, mamma,' put in Dounia. 'He doesn't\nknow who Marfa Petrovna is.'\n'Ah,  you  don't  know?  And  I  was  thinking  that\nyou  knew  all  about  us.  Forgive  me,  Dmitri\nProkofitch,  I  don't  know  what  I  am  thinking\nabout these last few days. I look upon you really\nas  a  providence  for  us,  and  so  I  took  it  for\ngranted  that  you  knew  all  about  us.  I  look  on\nyou as a relation.... Don't be angry with me for\nsaying so. Dear me, what's the matter with your\nright hand? Have you knocked it?'\n'Yes,  I  bruised  it,'  muttered  Razumihin\noverjoyed.\n'I sometimes speak too much from the heart, so\nthat Dounia finds fault with me.... But, dear me,\nwhat  a  cupboard  he  lives  in!  I  wonder  whether\nhe  is  awake?  Does  this  woman,  his  landlady,\nconsider it a room? Listen, you say he does not\nlike  to  show  his  feelings,  so  perhaps  I  shall\nannoy  him  with  my  ...  weaknesses?  Do  advise\nme, Dmitri Prokofitch, how am I to treat him? I\nfeel quite distracted, you know.'", "'Don't  question  him  too  much  about  anything  if\nyou  see  him  frown;  don't  ask  him  too  much\nabout  his  health;  he  doesn't  like  that.'(cid:24)1(cid:24)  Crime\nand  Punishment  'Ah,  Dmitri  Prokofitch,  how\nhard  it  is  to  be  a  mother!  But  here  are  the\nstairs.... What an awful staircase!'\n'Mother,  you  are  quite  pale,  don't  distress\nyourself,  darling,'  said  Dounia  caressing  her,\nthen with flashing eyes she added: 'He ought to\nbe happy at seeing you, and you are tormenting\nyourself so.'\n'Wait,  I'll  peep  in  and  see  whether  he  has\nwaked up.'\nThe  ladies  slowly  followed  Razumihin,  who\nwent  on  before,  and  when  they  reached  the\nlandlady's  door  on  the  fourth  storey,  they\nnoticed that her door was a tiny crack open and\nthat  two  keen  black  eyes  were  watching  them\nfrom the darkness within. When their eyes met,\nthe  door  was  suddenly  shut  with  such  a  slam\nthat Pulcheria Alexandrovna almost cried out.1(cid:24) ", "#$#$Chapter 19#$#$\n'He is well, quite well!' Zossimov cried cheerfully\nas they entered.\nHe  had  come  in  ten  minutes  earlier  and  was\nsitting in the same place as before, on the sofa.\nRaskolnikov  was  sitting  in  the  opposite  corner,\nfully  dressed  and  carefully  washed  and\ncombed,  as  he  had  not  been  for  some  time\npast.  The  room  was  immediately  crowded,  yet\nNastasya managed to follow the visitors in and\nstayed to listen.\nRaskolnikov  really  was  almost  well,  as\ncompared with his condition the day before, but\nhe  was  still  pale,  listless,  and  sombre.  He\nlooked  like  a  wounded  man  or  one  who  has\nundergone some terrible physical suffering. His\nbrows  were  knitted,  his  lips  compressed,  his\neyes feverish. He spoke little and reluctantly, as\nthough  performing  a  duty,  and  there  was  a\nrestlessness in his movements.\nHe only wanted a sling on his arm or a bandage", "on  his  finger  to  complete  the  impression  of  a\nman  with  a  painful  abscess  or  a  broken  arm.\nThe pale, sombre face lighted up for a moment\nwhen  his  mother  and  sister  entered,  but  this\nonly gave it a look of more intense suffering, in\nplace  of  its  listless  dejection.  The  light  soon\ndied  away,  but  the  look  of  suffering  remained,\nand  Zossimov,  watching  and  studying  his\npatient  with  all  the  zest  of  a  young  doctor\nbeginning  to  practise,  noticed  in  him  no  joy  at\nthe  arrival  of  his  mother  (cid:24)1(cid:24)  Crime  and\nPunishment  and  sister,  but  a  sort  of  bitter,\nhidden  determination  to  bear  another  hour  or\ntwo  of  inevitable  torture.  He  saw  later  that\nalmost every word of the following conversation\nseemed  to  touch  on  some  sore  place  and\nirritate it. But at the same time he marvelled at\nthe  power  of  controlling  himself  and  hiding  his\nfeelings in a patient who the previous day had,\nlike  a  monomaniac,  fallen  into  a  frenzy  at  the\nslightest word.\n'Yes,  I  see  myself  now  that  I  am  almost  well,'\nsaid Raskolnikov, giving his mother and sister a\nkiss  of  welcome  which  made  Pulcheria\nAlexandrovna  radiant  at  once.  'And  I  don't  say\nthis  as  I  did  yesterday  '  he  said,  addressing", "Razumihin, with a friendly pressure of his hand.\n'Yes,  indeed,  I  am  quite  surprised  at  him\nto-day,' began Zossimov, much delighted at the\nladies'  entrance,  for  he  had  not  succeeded  in\nkeeping  up  a  conversation  with  his  patient  for\nten minutes. 'In another three or four days, if he\ngoes on like this, he will be just as before, that\nis, as he was a month ago, or two ... or perhaps\neven three. This has been coming on for a long\nwhile....  eh?  Confess,  now,  that  it  has  been\nperhaps  your  own  fault?'  he  added,  with  a\ntentative smile, as though still afraid of irritating\nhim.\n'It  is  very  possible,'  answered  Raskolnikov\ncoldly.\n'I  should  say,  too,'  continued  Zossimov  with\nzest,  'that  your  complete  recovery  depends\nsolely on yourself. Now that one can talk to you,\nI  should  like  to  impress  upon  you  that  it  is\nessential to avoid the elementary, so to speak,\nfundamental  causes  tending  to  produce  your\nmorbid condition: in that case you will be cured,\nif  not,  it  will  go  from  bad  to  worse.  These\nfundamental  causes  I  don't  know,  but  1(cid:24)  they", "must  be  known  to  you.  You  are  an  intelligent\nman,  and  must  have  observed  yourself,  of\ncourse.  I  fancy  the  first  stage  of  your\nderangement  coincides  with  your  leaving  the\nuniversity.  You  must  not  be  left  without\noccupation, and so, work and a definite aim set\nbefore you might, I fancy, be very beneficial.'\n'Yes,  yes;  you  are  perfectly  right....  I  will  make\nhaste  and  return  to  the  university:  and  then\neverything will go smoothly....'\nZossimov,  who  had  begun  his  sage  advice\npartly to make an effect before the ladies, was\ncertainly somewhat mystified, when, glancing at\nhis patient, he observed unmistakable mockery\non  his  face.  This  lasted  an  instant,  however.\nPulcheria Alexandrovna began at once thanking\nZossimov, especially for his visit to their lodging\nthe previous night.\n'What!  he  saw  you  last  night?'  Raskolnikov\nasked,  as  though  startled.  'Then  you  have  not\nslept either after your journey.'\n'Ach,  Rodya,  that  was  only  till  two  o'clock.\nDounia  and  I  never  go  to  bed  before  two  at", "home.'\n'I  don't  know  how  to  thank  him  either,'\nRaskolnikov  went  on,  suddenly  frowning  and\nlooking  down.  'Setting  aside  the  question  of\npayment- forgive me for referring to it (he turned\nto  Zossimov)-I  really  don't  know  what  I  have\ndone  to  deserve  such  special  attention  from\nyou! I simply don't understand it ... and ... and ...\nit  weighs  upon  me,  indeed,  because  I  don't\nunderstand it. I tell you so candidly.'\n'Don't  be  irritated.'  Zossimov  forced  himself  to\nlaugh.  'Assume  that  you  are  my  first\npatient-well-we  fellows  just  (cid:24)1(cid:24)  Crime  and\nPunishment  beginning  to  practise  love  our  first\npatients as if they were our children, and some\nalmost  fall  in  love  with  them.  And,  of  course,  I\nam not rich in patients.'\n'I  say  nothing  about  him,'  added  Raskolnikov,\npointing  to  Razumihin,  'though  he  has  had\nnothing from me either but insult and trouble.'\n'What nonsense he is talking! Why, you are in a\nsentimental  mood  to-day,  are  you?'  shouted\nRazumihin.", "If he had had more penetration he would have\nseen that there was no trace of sentimentality in\nhim,  but  something  indeed  quite  the  opposite.\nBut  Avdotya  Romanovna  noticed  it.  She  was\nintently and uneasily watching her brother.\n'As  for  you,  mother,  I  don't  dare  to  speak,'  he\nwent on, as though repeating a lesson learned\nby heart. 'It is only today that I have been able\nto realise a little how distressed you must have\nbeen  here  yesterday,  waiting  for  me  to  come\nback.'\nWhen he had said this, he suddenly held out his\nhand to his sister, smiling without a word. But in\nthis  smile  there  was  a  flash  of  real  unfeigned\nfeeling.  Dounia  caught  it  at  once,  and  warmly\npressed  his  hand,  overjoyed  and  thankful.  It\nwas  the  first  time  he  had  addressed  her  since\ntheir  dispute  the  previous  day.  The  mother's\nface  lighted  up  with  ecstatic  happiness  at  the\nsight of this conclusive unspoken reconciliation.\n'Yes,  that  is  what  I  love  him  for,'  Razumihin,\nexaggerating  it  all,  muttered  to  himself,  with  a\nvigorous  turn  in  his  chair.  'He  has  these\nmovements.'", "'And  how  well  he  does  it  all,'  the  mother  was\nthinking to herself. 'What generous impulses he\nhas,  and  how  simply,  1(cid:24)  how  delicately  he  put\nan  end  to  all  the  misunderstanding  with  his\nsister-simply by holding out his hand at the right\nminute and looking at her like that.... And what\nfine  eyes  he  has,  and  how  fine  his  whole  face\nis!  ...  He  is  even  better  looking  than  Dounia....\nBut,  good  heavens,  what  a  suit  -how  terribly\nhe's  dressed!  ...  Vasya,  the  messenger  boy  in\nAfanasy  Ivanitch's  shop,  is  better  dressed!  I\ncould  rush  at  him  and  hug  him  ...  weep  over\nhim-but I am afraid.... Oh, dear, he's so strange!\nHe's talking kindly, but I'm afraid! Why, what am\nI afraid of? ...'\n'Oh,  Rodya,  you  wouldn't  believe,'  she  began\nsuddenly,  in  haste  to  answer  his  words  to  her,\n'how  unhappy  Dounia  and  I  were  yesterday!\nNow that it's all over and done with and we are\nquite happy again-I can tell you. Fancy, we ran\nhere  almost  straight  from  the  train  to  embrace\nyou  and  that  woman-ah,  here  she  is!  Good\nmorning, Nastasya! ... She told us at once that\nyou were lying in a high fever and had just run\naway from the doctor in delirium, and they were", "looking for you in the streets. You can't imagine\nhow we felt!

Of  course,  we\nexaggerated  things.  We  were  on  the  point  of\nrushing  to  find  Pyotr  Petrovitch  to  ask  him  to\nhelp....  Because  we  were  alone,  utterly  alone,'\nshe  said  plaintively  and  stopped  short,\nsuddenly,  recollecting  it  was  still  somewhat\ndangerous  to  speak  of  Pyotr  Petrovitch,\nalthough  'we  are  quite  happy  again.'(cid:24)(cid:24)0  Crime\nand Punishment 'Yes, yes.... Of course it's very\nannoying....'  Raskolnikov  muttered  in  reply,  but\nwith such a preoccupied and inattentive air that\nDounia gazed at him in perplexity.\n'What else was it I wanted to say?' He went on\ntrying  to  recollect.  'Oh,  yes;  mother,  and  you\ntoo,  Dounia,  please  don't  think  that  I  didn't\nmean  to  come  and  see  you  to-day  and  was\nwaiting for you to come first.'\n'What  are  you  saying,  Rodya?'  cried  Pulcheria\nAlexandrovna. She, too, was surprised.", "'Is  he  answering  us  as  a  duty?'  Dounia\nwondered.  'Is  he  being  reconciled  and  asking\nforgiveness as though he were performing a rite\nor repeating a lesson?'\n'I've  only  just  waked  up,  and  wanted  to  go  to\nyou,  but  was  delayed  owing  to  my  clothes;  I\nforgot  yesterday  to  ask  her  ...  Nastasya  ...  to\nwash out the blood ... I've only just dressed.'\n'Blood!  What  blood?'  Pulcheria  Alexandrovna\nasked in alarm.\n'Oh, nothing-don't be uneasy. It was when I was\nwandering  about  yesterday,  rather  delirious,  I\nchanced upon a man who had been run over ...\na clerk ...'\n'Delirious?  But  you  remember  everything!'\nRazumihin interrupted.\n'That's true,' Raskolnikov answered with special\ncarefulness. 'I remember everything even to the\nslightest detail, and yet-why I did that and went\nthere and said that, I can't clearly explain now.'", "'A  familiar  phenomenon,'  interposed  Zossimov,\n'actions are sometimes performed in a masterly\nand most cunning way, while the direction of the\nactions  is  deranged  and  de-(cid:24)1  pendent  on\nvarious morbid impressions- it's like a dream.'\n'Perhaps it's a good thing really that he should\nthink  me  almost  a  madman,'  thought\nRaskolnikov.\n'Why,  people  in  perfect  health  act  in  the  same\nway  too,'  observed  Dounia,  looking  uneasily  at\nZossimov.\n'There  is  some  truth  in  your  observation,'  the\nlatter replied. 'In that sense we are certainly all\nnot infrequently like madmen, but with the slight\ndifference  that  the  deranged  are  somewhat\nmadder, for we must draw a line. A normal man,\nit is true, hardly exists. Among dozens-perhaps\nhundreds of thousands-hardly one is to be met\nwith.'\nAt  the  word  'madman,'  carelessly  dropped  by\nZossimov in his chatter on his favourite subject,\neveryone frowned.", "Raskolnikov  sat  seeming  not  to  pay  attention,\nplunged  in  thought  with  a  strange  smile  on  his\npale lips. He was still meditating on something.\n'Well, what about the man who was run over? I\ninterrupted you!' Razumihin cried hastily.'What?'\nRaskolnikov  seemed  to  wake  up.  'Oh  ...  I  got\nspattered with blood helping to carry him to his\nlodging.  By  the  way,  mamma,  I  did  an\nunpardonable thing yesterday. I was literally out\nof my mind. I gave away all the money you sent\nme ... to his wife for the funeral. She's a widow\nnow,  in  consumption,  a  poor  creature  ...  three\nlittle children, starving ... nothing in the house ...\nthere's  a  daughter,  too  ...  perhaps  you'd  have\ngiven it yourself if you'd seen them. But I had no\nright  to  do  it  I  admit,  especially  as  I  knew  how\nyou needed the money yourself. To help others\none must have the right to do it, or else Crevez,\nchiens,  si  vous  n'êtes  (cid:24)  pas  contents.  '  He\nlaughed, 'That's right, isn't it, Dounia?'\n'No, it's not,' answered Dounia firmly.\n'Bah!  you,  too,  have  ideals,'  he  muttered,\nlooking  at  her  almost  with  hatred,  and  smiling\nsarcastically. 'I ought to have considered that....", "Well, that's praiseworthy, and it's better for you\n...  and  if  you  reach  a  line  you  won't  overstep,\nyou  will  be  unhappy  ...  and  if  you  overstep  it,\nmaybe you will be still unhappier.... But all that's\nnonsense,'  he  added  irritably,  vexed  at  being\ncarried  away.  'I  only  meant  to  say  that  I  beg\nyour forgiveness, mother,' he concluded, shortly\nand abruptly.\n'That's  enough,  Rodya,  I  am  sure  that\neverything  you  do  is  very  good,'  said  his\nmother, delighted.\n'Don't  be  too  sure,'  he  answered,  twisting  his\nmouth into a smile.\nA  silence  followed.  There  was  a  certain\nconstraint  in  all  this  conversation,  and  in  the\nsilence,  and  in  the  reconciliation,  and  in  the\nforgiveness, and all were feeling it.\n'It  is  as  though  they  were  afraid  of  me,'\nRaskolnikov  was  thinking  to  himself,  looking\naskance  at  his  mother  and  sister.  Pulcheria\nAlexandrovna  was  indeed  growing  more  timid\nthe longer she kept silent.", "'Yet in their absence I seemed to love them so\nmuch,' flashed through his mind.\n'Do you know, Rodya, Marfa Petrovna is dead,'\nPulcheria Alexandrovna suddenly blurted out.\n'What Marfa Petrovna?'\n'Oh, mercy on us-Marfa Petrovna Svidrigaïlov. I\nwrote  you  so  much  about  her.'(cid:24)(cid:24)  'A-a-h!  Yes,  I\nremember....  So  she's  dead!  Oh,  really?'  he\nroused himself suddenly, as if waking up. 'What\ndid she die of?'\n'Only  imagine,  quite  suddenly,'  Pulcheria\nAlexandrovna  answered  hurriedly,  encouraged\nby his curiosity. 'On the very day I was sending\nyou that letter! Would you believe it, that awful\nman  seems  to  have  been  the  cause  of  her\ndeath. They say he beat her dreadfully.'\n'Why, were they on such bad terms?' he asked,\naddressing his sister.\n'Not at all. Quite the contrary indeed. With her,\nhe  was  always  very  patient,  considerate  even.\nIn fact, all those seven years of their married life", "he  gave  way  to  her,  too  much  so  indeed,  in\nmany cases. All of a sudden he seems to have\nlost patience.'\n'Then  he  could  not  have  been  so  awful  if  he\ncontrolled  himself  for  seven  years?  You  seem\nto be defending him, Dounia?'\n'No,  no,  he's  an  awful  man!  I  can  imagine\nnothing  more  awful!'  Dounia  answered,  almost\nwith a shudder, knitting her brows, and sinking\ninto thought.\n'That  had  happened  in  the  morning,'  Pulcheria\nAlexandrovna  went  on  hurriedly.  'And  directly\nafterwards  she  ordered  the  horses  to  be\nharnessed to drive to the town immediately after\ndinner. She always used to drive to the town in\nsuch  cases.  She  ate  a  very  good  dinner,  I  am\ntold....'\n'After the beating?'\n'That was always her ... habit; and immediately\nafter dinner, so as not to be late in starting, she\nwent  to  the  bath(cid:24)  house....  You  see,  she  was\nundergoing  some  treatment  with  baths.  They", "have a cold spring there, and she used to bathe\nin it regularly every day, and no sooner had she\ngot  into  the  water  when  she  suddenly  had  a\nstroke!'\n'I should think so,' said Zossimov.\n'And did he beat her badly?'\n'What does that matter!' put in Dounia.\n'H'm!  But  I  don't  know  why  you  want  to  tell  us\nsuch gossip, mother,' said Raskolnikov irritably,\nas it were in spite of himself.\n'Ah,  my  dear,  I  don't  know  what  to  talk  about,'\nbroke from Pulcheria Alexandrovna.\n'Why, are you all afraid of me?' he asked, with a\nconstrained smile.\n'That's  certainly  true,'  said  Dounia,  looking\ndirectly and sternly at her brother. 'Mother was\ncrossing herself with terror as she came up the\nstairs.'\nHis face worked, as though in convulsion.", "'Ach,  what  are  you  saying,  Dounia!  Don't  be\nangry,  please,  Rodya....  Why  did  you  say  that,\nDounia?'  Pulcheria  Alexandrovna  began,\noverwhelmed-'You  see,  coming  here,  I  was\ndreaming  all  the  way,  in  the  train,  how  we\nshould  meet,  how  we  should  talk  over\neverything together.... And I was so happy, I did\nnot notice the journey! But what am I saying? I\nam  happy  now....  You  should  not,  Dounia....  I\nam happy now-simply in seeing you, Rodya....'\n'Hush,  mother,'  he  muttered  in  confusion,  not\nlooking at her, but pressing her hand. 'We shall\nhave time to speak freely of everything!'(cid:24)(cid:24) As he\nsaid  this,  he  was  suddenly  overwhelmed  with\nconfusion  and  turned  pale.  Again  that  awful\nsensation  he  had  known  of  late  passed  with\ndeadly  chill  over  his  soul.  Again  it  became\nsuddenly  plain  and  perceptible  to  him  that  he\nhad  just  told  a  fearful  lie-that  he  would  never\nnow  be  able  to  speak  freely  of  everything-that\nhe  would  never  again  be  able  to  speak  of\nanything to anyone. The anguish of this thought\nwas  such  that  for  a  moment  he  almost  forgot\nhimself.  He  got  up  from  his  seat,  and  not\nlooking at anyone walked towards the door.", "'What  are  you  about?'  cried  Razumihin,\nclutching him by the arm.\nHe  sat  down  again,  and  began  looking  about\nhim, in silence. They were all looking at him in\nperplexity.\n'But  what  are  you  all  so  dull  for?'  he  shouted,\nsuddenly  and  quite  unexpectedly.  'Do  say\nsomething!  What's  the  use  of  sitting  like  this?\nCome,  do  speak.  Let  us  talk....  We  meet\ntogether and sit in silence.... Come, anything!'\n'Thank  God;  I  was  afraid  the  same  thing  as\nyesterday was beginning again,' said Pulcheria\nAlexandrovna, crossing herself.\n'What  is  the  matter,  Rodya?'  asked  Avdotya\nRomanovna, distrustfully.\n'Oh,  nothing!  I  remembered  something,'  he\nanswered, and suddenly laughed.\n'Well,  if  you  remembered  something;  that's  all\nright!  ...  I  was  beginning  to  think  ...'  muttered\nZossimov, getting up from the sofa. 'It is time for", "me to be off. I will look in again perhaps ... if I\ncan ...' He made his bows, and went out.(cid:24) 'What\nan  excellent  man!'  observed  Pulcheria\nAlexandrovna.\n'Yes,  excellent,  splendid,  well-educated,\nintelligent,'  Raskolnikov  began,  suddenly\nspeaking  with  surprising  rapidity,  and  a\nliveliness  he  had  not  shown  till  then.  'I  can't\nremember where I met him before my illness....\nI  believe  I  have  met  him  somewhere--  ...  And\nthis  is  a  good  man,  too,'  he  nodded  at\nRazumihin. 'Do you like him, Dounia?' he asked\nher;  and  suddenly,  for  some  unknown  reason,\nlaughed.\n'Very much,' answered Dounia.\n'Foo!-what a pig you are!' Razumihin protested,\nblushing  in  terrible  confusion,  and  he  got  up\nfrom  his  chair.  Pulcheria  Alexandrovna  smiled\nfaintly, but Raskolnikov laughed aloud.\n'Where are you off to?'\n'I must go.'", "'You need not at all. Stay. Zossimov has gone,\nso  you  must.  Don't  go.  What's  the  time?  Is  it\ntwelve  o'clock?  What  a  pretty  watch  you  have\ngot, Dounia. But why are you all silent again?

Hardly like a lady's.'\n'I like that sort,' said Dounia.\n'So it is not a present from her fiancé ' thought\nRazumihin, and was unreasonably delighted.\n'I thought  it  was  Luzhin's present,' observed \nRaskol-(cid:24)(cid:24) nikov.\n'No, he has not made Dounia any presents yet.'\n'A-ah! And do you remember, mother, I was in\nlove  and  wanted  to  get  married?'  he  said\nsuddenly,  looking  at  his  mother,  who  was", "disconcerted  by  the  sudden  change  of  subject\nand the way he spoke of it.\n'Oh, yes, my dear.'\nPulcheria  Alexandrovna  exchanged  glances\nwith Dounia and Razumihin.\n'H'm,  yes.  What  shall  I  tell  you?  I  don't\nremember much indeed. She was such a sickly\ngirl,'  he  went  on,  growing  dreamy  and  looking\ndown again. 'Quite an invalid. She was fond of\ngiving  alms  to  the  poor,  and  was  always\ndreaming of a nunnery, and once she burst into\ntears  when  she  began  talking  to  me  about  it.\nYes,  yes,  I  remember.  I  remember  very  well.\nShe was an ugly little thing. I really don't know\nwhat drew me to her then-I think it was because\nshe  was  always  ill.  If  she  had  been  lame  or\nhunchback,  I  believe  I  should  have  liked  her\nbetter  still,'  he  smiled  dreamily.  'Yes,  it  was  a\nsort of spring delirium.'\n'No,  it  was  not  only  spring  delirium,'  said\nDounia, with warm feeling.\nHe fixed a strained intent look on his sister, but", "did  not  hear  or  did  not  understand  her  words.\nThen,  completely  lost  in  thought,  he  got  up,\nwent up to his mother, kissed her, went back to\nhis place and sat down.\n'You  love  her  even  now?'  said  Pulcheria\nAlexandrovna, touched.\n'Her? Now? Oh, yes.... You ask about her? No\n... that's (cid:24) all now, as it were, in another world ...\nand  so  long  ago.  And  indeed  everything\nhappening here seems somehow far away.' He\nlooked attentively at them. 'You, now ... I seem\nto  be  looking  at  you  from  a  thousand  miles\naway  ...  but,  goodness  knows  why  we  are\ntalking  of  that!  And  what's  the  use  of  asking\nabout it?' he added with annoyance, and biting\nhis nails, fell into dreamy silence again.\n'What a wretched lodging you have, Rodya! It's\nlike  a  tomb,'  said  Pulcheria  Alexandrovna,\nsuddenly breaking the oppressive silence. 'I am\nsure  it's  quite  half  through  your  lodging  you\nhave become so melancholy.'\n'My  lodging,'  he  answered,  listlessly.  'Yes,  the\nlodging  had  a  great  deal  to  do  with  it....  I", "thought  that,  too....  If  only  you  knew,  though,\nwhat a strange thing you said just now, mother,'\nhe said, laughing strangely.\nA  little  more,  and  their  companionship,  this\nmother  and  this  sister,  with  him  after  three\nyears'  absence,  this  intimate  tone  of\nconversation, in face of the utter impossibility of\nreally  speaking  about  anything,  would  have\nbeen beyond his power of endurance. But there\nwas  one  urgent  matter  which  must  be  settled\none  way  or  the  other  that  day-so  he  had\ndecided  when  he  woke.  Now  he  was  glad  to\nremember it, as a means of escape.\n'Listen, Dounia,' he began, gravely and drily, 'of\ncourse  I  beg  your  pardon  for  yesterday,  but  I\nconsider it my duty to tell you again that I do not\nwithdraw from my chief point. It is me or Luzhin.\nIf  I  am  a  scoundrel,  you  must  not  be.  One  is\nenough. If you marry Luzhin, I cease at once to\nlook  on  you  as  a  sister.'(cid:24)(cid:24)  'Rodya,  Rodya!  It  is\nthe  same  as  yesterday  again,'  Pulcheria\nAlexandrovna  cried,  mournfully.  'And  why  do\nyou  call  yourself  a  scoundrel?  I  can't  bear  it.\nYou said the same yesterday.'", "'Brother,'  Dounia  answered  firmly  and  with  the\nsame dryness. 'In all this there is a mistake on\nyour  part.  I  thought  it  over  at  night,  and  found\nout  the  mistake.  It  is  all  because  you  seem  to\nfancy  I  am  sacrificing  myself  to  someone  and\nfor  someone.  That  is  not  the  case  at  all.  I  am\nsimply  marrying  for  my  own  sake,  because\nthings  are  hard  for  me.  Though,  of  course,  I\nshall be glad if I succeed in being useful to my\nfamily.  But  that  is  not  the  chief  motive  for  my\ndecision....'\n'She  is  lying,'  he  thought  to  himself,  biting  his\nnails  vindictively.  'Proud  creature!  She  won't\nadmit  she  wants  to  do  it  out  of  charity!  Too\nhaughty!  Oh,  base  characters!  They  even  love\nas though they hate.... Oh, how I ... hate them\nall!'\n'In fact,' continued Dounia, 'I am marrying Pyotr\nPetrovitch  because  of  two  evils  I  choose  the\nless.  I  intend  to  do  honestly  all  he  expects  of\nme,  so  I  am  not  deceiving  him....  Why  did  you\nsmile  just  now?'  She,  too,  flushed,  and  there\nwas a gleam of anger in her eyes.\n'All?' he asked, with a malignant grin.", "'Within certain limits. Both the manner and form\nof  Pyotr  Petrovitch's  courtship  showed  me  at\nonce what he wanted. He may, of course, think\ntoo well of himself, but I hope he esteems me,\ntoo.... Why are you laughing again?'\n'And why are you blushing again? You are lying,\nsister.  (cid:24)(cid:24)0  Crime  and  Punishment  You  are\nintentionally  lying,  simply  from  feminine\nobstinacy,  simply  to  hold  your  own  against\nme....  You  cannot  respect  Luzhin.  I  have  seen\nhim  and  talked  with  him.  So  you  are  selling\nyourself for money, and so in any case you are\nacting  basely,  and  I  am  glad  at  least  that  you\ncan blush for it.'\n'It  is  not  true.  I  am  not  lying,'  cried  Dounia,\nlosing her composure. 'I would not marry him if I\nwere  not  convinced  that  he  esteems  me  and\nthinks  highly  of  me.  I  would  not  marry  him  if  I\nwere  not  firmly  convinced  that  I  can  respect\nhim. Fortunately, I can have convincing proof of\nit this very day ... and such a marriage is not a\nvileness,  as  you  say!  And  even  if  you  were\nright, if I really had determined on a vile action,\nis it not merciless on your part to speak to me", "like that? Why do you demand of me a heroism\nthat  perhaps  you  have  not  either?  It  is\ndespotism;  it  is  tyranny.  If  I  ruin  anyone,  it  is\nonly  myself....  I  am  not  committing  a  murder.\nWhy do you look at me like that? Why are you\nso pale? Rodya, darling, what's the matter?'\n'Good heavens! You have made him faint,' cried\nPulcheria Alexandrovna.\n'No,  no,  nonsense!  It's  nothing.  A  little\ngiddiness-not fainting. You have fainting on the\nbrain. H'm, yes, what was I saying? Oh, yes. In\nwhat  way  will  you  get  convincing  proof  to-day\nthat  you  can  respect  him,  and  that  he  ...\nesteems  you,  as  you  said.  I  think  you  said\nto-day?'\n'Mother,  show  Rodya  Pyotr  Petrovitch's  letter,'\nsaid Dounia.\nWith  trembling  hands,  Pulcheria  Alexandrovna\ngave  him  the  letter.  He  took  it  with  great\ninterest,  but,  before  (cid:24)1  opening  it,  he  suddenly\nlooked with a sort of wonder at Dounia.\n'It is strange,' he said, slowly, as though struck", "by a new idea. 'What am I making such a fuss\nfor? What is it all about? Marry whom you like!'\nHe  said  this  as  though  to  himself,  but  said  it\naloud, and looked for some time at his sister, as\nthough  puzzled.  He  opened  the  letter  at  last,\nstill with the same look of strange wonder on his\nface.  Then,  slowly  and  attentively,  he  began\nreading,  and  read  it  through  twice.  Pulcheria\nAlexandrovna  showed  marked  anxiety,  and  all\nindeed expected something particular.\n'What  surprises  me,'  he  began,  after  a  short\npause, handing the letter to his mother, but not\naddressing anyone in particular, 'is that he is a\nbusiness man, a lawyer, and his conversation is\npretentious  indeed,  and  yet  he  writes  such  an\nuneducated letter.'\nThey all started. They had expected something\nquite different.\n'But  they  all  write  like  that,  you  know,'\nRazumihin observed, abruptly.\n'Have you read it?''Yes.'", "'We  showed  him,  Rodya.  We  ...  consulted  him\njust  now,'  Pulcheria  Alexandrovna  began,\nembarrassed.\n'That's just the jargon of the courts,' Razumihin\nput in. 'Legal documents are written like that to\nthis day.'\n'Legal?  Yes,  it's  just  legal-business\nlanguage-not so very uneducated, and not quite\neducated-business language!'(cid:24) 'Pyotr Petrovitch\nmakes no secret of the fact that he had a cheap\neducation,  he  is  proud  indeed  of  having  made\nhis  own  way,'  Avdotya  Romanovna  observed,\nsomewhat offended by her brother's tone.\n'Well, if he's proud of it, he has reason, I don't\ndeny it. You seem to be offended, sister, at my\nmaking  only  such  a  frivolous  criticism  on  the\nletter,  and  to  think  that  I  speak  of  such  trifling\nmatters on purpose to annoy you. It is quite the\ncontrary,  an  observation  apropos  of  the  style\noccurred  to  me  that  is  by  no  means  irrelevant\nas  things  stand.  There  is  one  expression,\n'blame  yourselves'  put  in  very  significantly  and\nplainly, and there is besides a threat that he will\ngo away at once if I am present. That threat to", "go  away  is  equivalent  to  a  threat  to  abandon\nyou both if you are disobedient, and to abandon\nyou  now  after  summoning  you  to  Petersburg.\nWell,  what  do  you  think?  Can  one  resent  such\nan  expression  from  Luzhin,  as  we  should  if  he\n(he  pointed  to  Razumihin)  had  written  it,  or\nZossimov, or one of us?'\n'N-no,'  answered  Dounia,  with  more  animation.\n'I saw clearly that it was too naïvely expressed,\nand  that  perhaps  he  simply  has  no  skill  in\nwriting  ...  that  is  a  true  criticism,  brother.  I  did\nnot expect, indeed ...'\n'It  is  expressed  in  legal  style,  and  sounds\ncoarser  than  perhaps  he  intended.  But  I  must\ndisillusion  you  a  little.  There  is  one  expression\nin the letter, one slander about me, and rather a\ncontemptible one. I gave the money last night to\nthe  widow,  a  woman  in  consumption,  crushed\nwith  trouble,  and  not  'on  the  pretext  of  the\nfuneral,'  but  simply  to  pay  for  the  funeral,  and\nnot  to  the  daughter-a  young  woman,  as  (cid:24)(cid:24)  he\nwrites, of notorious behaviour (whom I saw last\nnight  for  the  first  time  in  my  life)-but  to  the\nwidow.  In  all  this  I  see  a  too  hasty  desire  to\nslander me and to raise dissension between us.", "It  is  expressed  again  in  legal  jargon,  that  is  to\nsay, with a too obvious display of the aim, and\nwith  a  very  naïve  eagerness.  He  is  a  man  of\nintelligence,  but  to  act  sensibly,  intelligence  is\nnot enough. It all shows the man and ... I don't\nthink  he  has  a  great  esteem  for  you.  I  tell  you\nthis  simply  to  warn  you,  because  I  sincerely\nwish for your good ...'\nDounia  did  not  reply.  Her  resolution  had  been\ntaken. She was only awaiting the evening.\n'Then  what  is  your  decision,  Rodya?'  asked\nPulcheria Alexandrovna, who was more uneasy\nthan ever at the sudden, new businesslike tone\nof his talk.\n'What decision?'\n'You see Pyotr Petrovitch writes that you are not\nto  be  with  us  this  evening,  and  that  he  will  go\naway if you come. So will you ... come?'\n'That, of course, is not for me to decide, but for\nyou  first,  if  you  are  not  offended  by  such  a\nrequest; and secondly, by Dounia, if she, too, is\nnot  offended.  I  will  do  what  you  think  best,'  he", "added, drily.\n'Dounia  has  already  decided,  and  I  fully  agree\nwith  her,'  Pulcheria  Alexandrovna  hastened  to\ndeclare.\n'I decided to ask you, Rodya, to urge you not to\nfail to be with us at this interview,' said Dounia.\n'Will you come?''Yes.'\n'I will ask you, too, to be with us at eight o'clock,'\nshe  said,  addressing  Razumihin.  'Mother,  I  am\ninviting him, too.'(cid:24) 'Quite  right,  Dounia.  Well, \nsince    you    have    decided,'  added  Pulcheria\nAlexandrovna,  'so  be  it.  I  shall  feel  easier\nmyself.  I  do  not  like  concealment  and\ndeception. Better let us have the whole truth....\nPyotr Petrovitch may be angry or not, now!'(cid:24)(cid:24) ", "#$#$Chapter 20#$#$\nAt that moment the door was softly opened, and\na  young  girl  walked  into  the  room,  looking\ntimidly about her. Everyone turned towards her\nwith  surprise  and  curiosity.  At  first  sight,\nRaskolnikov did not recognise her. It was Sofya\nSemyonovna  Marmeladov.  He  had  seen  her\nyesterday  for  the  first  time,  but  at  such  a\nmoment,  in  such  surroundings  and  in  such  a\ndress, that his memory retained a very different\nimage  of  her.  Now  she  was  a  modestly  and\npoorlydressed  young  girl,  very  young,  indeed,\nalmost  like  a  child,  with  a  modest  and  refined\nmanner,  with  a  candid  but  somewhat\nfrightened-looking face. She was wearing a very\nplain  indoor  dress,  and  had  on  a  shabby  old-\nfashioned  hat,  but  she  still  carried  a  parasol.\nUnexpectedly  finding  the  room  full  of  people,\nshe  was  not  so  much  embarrassed  as\ncompletely  overwhelmed  with  shyness,  like  a\nlittle child. She was even about to retreat. 'Oh ...\nit's  you!'  said  Raskolnikov,  extremely\nastonished,  and  he,  too,  was  confused.  He  at\nonce  recollected  that  his  mother  and  sister", "knew  through  Luzhin's  letter  of  'some  young\nwoman of notorious behaviour.' He had only just\nbeen  protesting  against  Luzhin's  calumny  and\ndeclaring that he had seen the girl last night for\nthe first time, and suddenly she had walked in.\nHe remembered, too, that he had not protested\nagainst the expression 'of notorious behaviour.'\nAll this passed vaguely and fleetingly (cid:24) through\nhis  brain,  but  looking  at  her  more  intently,  he\nsaw  that  the  humiliated  creature  was  so\nhumiliated  that  he  felt  suddenly  sorry  for  her.\nWhen  she  made  a  movement  to  retreat  in\nterror, it sent a pang to his heart.\n'I did not expect you,' he said, hurriedly, with a\nlook that made her stop. 'Please sit down. You\ncome, no doubt, from Katerina Ivanovna. Allow\nme-not there. Sit here....'\nAt Sonia's entrance, Razumihin, who had been\nsitting  on  one  of  Raskolnikov's  three  chairs,\nclose  to  the  door,  got  up  to  allow  her  to  enter.\nRaskolnikov had at first shown her the place on\nthe  sofa  where  Zossimov  had  been  sitting,  but\nfeeling that the sofa which served him as a bed,\nwas too familiar a place, he hurriedly motioned\nher to Razumihin's chair.", "'You sit here,' he said to Razumihin, putting him\non the sofa.\nSonia sat down, almost shaking with terror, and\nlooked timidly at the two ladies. It was evidently\nalmost  inconceivable  to  herself  that  she  could\nsit  down  beside  them.  At  the  thought  of  it,  she\nwas  so  frightened  that  she  hurriedly  got  up\nagain,  and  in  utter  confusion  addressed\nRaskolnikov.\n'I ... I ... have come for one minute. Forgive me\nfor  disturbing  you,'  she  began  falteringly.  'I\ncome from Katerina Ivanovna, and she had no\none to send. Katerina Ivanovna told me to beg\nyou ... to be at the service ... in the morning ...\nat Mitrofanievsky ... and then ... to us ... to her\n...  to  do  her  the  honour  ...  she  told  me  to  beg\nyou ...' Sonia stammered and ceased speaking.\n'I  will  try,  certainly,  most  certainly,'  answered\nRaskolnikov.  He,  too,  stood  up,  and  he,  too,\nfaltered  and  could  not  (cid:24)(cid:24)  finish  his  sentence.\n'Please  sit  down,'  he  said,  suddenly.  'I  want  to\ntalk  to  you.  You  are  perhaps  in  a  hurry,  but\nplease, be so kind, spare me two minutes,' and", "he drew up a chair for her.\nSonia  sat  down  again,  and  again  timidly  she\ntook a hurried, frightened look at the two ladies,\nand dropped her eyes. Raskolnikov's pale face\nflushed,  a  shudder  passed  over  him,  his  eyes\nglowed.\n'Mother,'  he  said,  firmly  and  insistently,  'this  is\nSofya  Semyonovna  Marmeladov,  the  daughter\nof  that  unfortunate  Mr.  Marmeladov,  who  was\nrun  over  yesterday  before  my  eyes,  and  of\nwhom I was just telling you.'\nPulcheria  Alexandrovna  glanced  at  Sonia,  and\nslightly  screwed  up  her  eyes.  In  spite  of  her\nembarrassment  before  Rodya's  urgent  and\nchallenging  look,  she  could  not  deny  herself\nthat  satisfaction.  Dounia  gazed  gravely  and\nintently into the poor girl's face, and scrutinised\nher  with  perplexity.  Sonia,  hearing  herself\nintroduced,  tried  to  raise  her  eyes  again,  but\nwas more embarrassed than ever.\n'I wanted to ask you,' said Raskolnikov, hastily,\n'how things were arranged yesterday. You were\nnot worried by the police, for instance?'", "'No, that was all right ... it was too evident, the\ncause of death ... they did not worry us ... only\nthe lodgers are angry.''Why?'\n'At  the  body's  remaining  so  long.  You  see  it  is\nhot now. So that, to-day, they will carry it to the\ncemetery,  into  the  chapel,  until  to-morrow.  At\nfirst Katerina Ivanovna was un(cid:24) willing, but now\nshe sees herself that it's necessary ...'\n'To-day, then?'\n'She begs you to do us the honour to be in the\nchurch to-morrow for the service, and then to be\npresent at the funeral lunch.'\n'She is giving a funeral lunch?'\n'Yes ... just a little.... She told me to thank you\nvery much for helping us yesterday. But for you,\nwe should have had nothing for the funeral.'\nAll  at  once  her  lips  and  chin  began  trembling,\nbut,  with  an  effort,  she  controlled  herself,\nlooking down again.", "During    the    conversation,    Raskolnikov \nwatched    her  carefully.  She  had  a  thin,  very\nthin, pale little face, rather irregular and angular,\nwith a sharp little nose and chin. She could not\nhave been called pretty, but her blue eyes were\nso  clear,  and  when  they  lighted  up,  there  was\nsuch  a  kindliness  and  simplicity  in  her\nexpression  that  one  could  not  help  being\nattracted.  Her  face,  and  her  whole  figure\nindeed,  had  another  peculiar  characteristic.  In\nspite of her eighteen years, she looked almost a\nlittle  girl-almost  a  child.  And  in  some  of  her\ngestures,  this  childishness  seemed  almost\nabsurd.\n'But  has  Katerina  Ivanovna  been  able  to\nmanage  with  such  small  means?  Does  she\neven  mean  to  have  a  funeral  lunch?'\nRaskolnikov asked, persistently keeping up the\nconversation.\n'The  coffin  will  be  plain,  of  course  ...  and\neverything  will  be  plain,  so  it  won't  cost  much.\nKaterina  Ivanovna  and  I  have  reckoned  it  all\nout,  so  that  there  will  be  enough  left  (cid:24)(cid:24)  ...  and\nKaterina  Ivanovna  was  very  anxious  it  should\nbe  so.  You  know  one  can't  ...  it's  a  comfort  to", "her ... she is like that, you know....'\n'I understand, I understand ... of course ... why\ndo  you  look  at  my  room  like  that?  My  mother\nhas just said it is like a tomb.'\n'You gave us everything yesterday,' Sonia said\nsuddenly, in reply, in a loud rapid whisper; and\nagain  she  looked  down  in  confusion.  Her  lips\nand  chin  were  trembling  once  more.  She  had\nbeen  struck  at  once  by  Raskolnikov's  poor\nsurroundings,  and  now  these  words  broke  out\nspontaneously. A silence followed. There was a\nlight  in  Dounia's  eyes,  and  even  Pulcheria\nAlexandrovna looked kindly at Sonia.\n'Rodya,'  she  said,  getting  up,  'we  shall  have\ndinner  together,  of  course.  Come,  Dounia....\nAnd you, Rodya, had better go for a little walk,\nand then rest and lie down before you come to\nsee us.... I am afraid we have exhausted you....'\n'Yes,  yes,  I'll  come,'  he  answered,  getting  up\nfussily. 'But I have something to see to.'\n'But surely you will have dinner together?' cried\nRazumihin,  looking  in  surprise  at  Raskolnikov.", "'What do you mean?'\n'Yes, yes, I am coming ... of course, of course!\nAnd  you  stay  a  minute.  You  do  not  want  him\njust  now,  do  you,  mother?  Or  perhaps  I  am\ntaking him from you?'\n'Oh,  no,  no.  And  will  you,  Dmitri  Prokofitch,  do\nus the favour of dining with us?'\n'Please do,' added Dounia.\nRazumihin  bowed,  positively  radiant.  For  one\nmoment,  (cid:24)(cid:24)0  Crime  and  Punishment  they  were\nall strangely embarrassed.\n'Good-bye, Rodya, that is till we meet. I do not\nlike saying good-bye. Good-bye, Nastasya. Ah,\nI have said good-bye again.'\nPulcheria  Alexandrovna  meant  to  greet  Sonia,\ntoo; but it somehow failed to come off, and she\nwent in a flutter out of the room.\nBut  Avdotya  Romanovna  seemed  to  await  her\nturn,  and  following  her  mother  out,  gave  Sonia\nan  attentive,  courteous  bow.  Sonia,  in", "confusion,  gave  a  hurried,  frightened  curtsy.\nThere was a look of poignant discomfort in her\nface, as though Avdotya Romanovna's courtesy\nand  attention  were  oppressive  and  painful  to\nher.\n'Dounia,  good-bye,'  called  Raskolnikov,  in  the\npassage. 'Give me your hand.'\n'Why, I did give it to you. Have you forgotten?'\nsaid  Dounia,  turning  warmly  and  awkwardly  to\nhim.\n'Never  mind,  give  it  to  me  again.'  And  he\nsqueezed her fingers warmly.\nDounia  smiled,  flushed,  pulled  her  hand  away,\nand went off quite happy.\n'Come,  that's  capital,'  he  said  to  Sonia,  going\nback  and  looking  brightly  at  her.  'God  give\npeace  to  the  dead,  the  living  have  still  to  live.\nThat is right, isn't it?'\nSonia  looked  surprised  at  the  sudden\nbrightness  of  his  face.  He  looked  at  her  for\nsome moments in silence. The whole history of", "the  dead  father  floated  before  his  memory  in\nthose  moments....(cid:24)1  'Heavens,  Dounia,'\nPulcheria Alexandrovna began, as soon as they\nwere in the street, 'I really feel relieved myself at\ncoming away-more at ease. How little did I think\nyesterday  in  the  train  that  I  could  ever  be  glad\nof that.'\n'I tell you again, mother, he is still very ill. Don't\nyou  see  it?  Perhaps  worrying  about  us  upset\nhim. We must be patient, and much, much can\nbe forgiven.''Well,  you  were  not  very  patient!'\n  Pulcheria    Alexandrovna  caught  her  up,  hotly\nand  jealously.  'Do  you  know,  Dounia,  I  was\nlooking at you two. You are the very portrait of\nhim,  and  not  so  much  in  face  as  in  soul.  You\nare  both  melancholy,  both  morose  and\nhot-tempered,  both  haughty  and  both\ngenerous....  Surely  he  can't  be  an  egoist,\nDounia. Eh? When I think of what is in store for\nus this evening, my heart sinks!'\n'Don't  be  uneasy,  mother.

Well,  you  may\nbelieve  it  or  not,  but  as  soon  as  she  came  in,\nthat  very  minute,  I  felt  that  she  was  the  chief\ncause of the trouble....'", "'Nothing  of  the  sort!'  cried  Dounia,  in  vexation.\n'What  nonsense,  with  your  presentiments,\nmother!  He  only  made  her  acquaintance  the\nevening before, and he did not know her when\nshe came in.'\n'Well,  you  will  see....  She  worries  me;  but  you\nwill see, you will see! I was so frightened. She\nwas  gazing  at  me  with  those  eyes.  I  could\nscarcely  sit  still  in  my  chair  when  he  began\nintroducing her, do you remember? It seems so\nstrange,  but  Pyotr  Petrovitch  writes  like  that\nabout  her,  and  he  introduces  her  to  us-to  you!\nSo he must think a great deal of her.'\n'People  will  write  anything.  We  were  talked\nabout  and  written  about,  too.  Have  you\nforgotten? I am sure that she is a good girl, and\nthat it is all nonsense.'\n'God grant it may be!'\n'And  Pyotr  Petrovitch  is  a  contemptible\nslanderer,' Dounia snapped out, suddenly.\nPulcheria  Alexandrovna  was  crushed;  the", "conversation was not resumed.\n'I  will  tell  you  what  I  want  with  you,'  said\nRaskolnikov,  drawing  Razumihin  to  the\nwindow.(cid:24)(cid:24) 'Then I will tell Katerina Ivanovna that\nyou are coming,' Sonia said hurriedly, preparing\nto depart.\n'One  minute,  Sofya  Semyonovna.

I  know  I  ought  to  have  given  notice  at  the\npolice  station,  but  would  it  not  be  better  to  go\nstraight to Porfiry? Eh? What do you think? The\nmatter might be settled more quickly. You see,\nmother may ask for it before dinner.'\n'Certainly  not  to  the  police  station.  Certainly  to\nPorfiry,' Razumihin  shouted  in  extraordinary \nexcitement.  'Well, how glad I am.

'I will come to\nyou  today,  Sofya  Semyonovna.  Only  tell  me\nwhere you live.'\nHe  was  not  exactly  ill  at  ease,  but  seemed\nhurried, and avoided her eyes. Sonia gave her\naddress,  and  flushed  as  she  did  so.  They  all\nwent out together.\n'Don't you lock up?' asked Razumihin, following\nhim on to the stairs.\n'Never,'  answered  Raskolnikov.  'I  have  been\nmeaning  to  buy  a  lock  for  these  two  years.\nPeople are happy who have no need of locks,'\nhe  said,  laughing,  to  Sonia.

I did not know you had only a\nroom  too....  Good-bye,  I  will  tell  Katerina\nIvanovna.'\nShe  was  extremely  glad  to  escape  at  last;  she\nwent away looking down, hurrying to get out of\nsight  as  soon  as  possible,  to  walk  the  twenty\nsteps to the turning on the right and to be at last\nalone, and then moving rapidly along, looking at", "no one, noticing nothing, to think, to remember,\nto meditate on every word, every detail. Never,\nnever had she felt anything like this. Dimly and\nunconsciously a whole new world was opening\nbefore  her.  She  remembered  suddenly  that\nRaskolnikov  meant  to  come  to  her  that  day,\nperhaps at once!\n'Only  not  to-day,  please,  not  to-day!'  she  kept\nmuttering  with  a  sinking  heart,  as  though\nentreating  someone,  like  a  frightened  child.\n'Mercy!  to  me  ...  to  that  room  ...  he  will  see  ...\noh, dear!'\nShe was not capable at that instant of noticing\nan  unknown  gentleman  who  was  watching  her\nand  following  at  her  heels.  He  had\naccompanied  her  from  the  gateway.  At  the\nmoment  when  Razumihin,  Raskolnikov,  and\nshe  stood  still  at  parting  on  the  pavement,  this\ngentleman,  who  was  just  passing,  started  on\nhearing  Sonia's  words:  'and  I  asked  where  Mr.\nRaskolnikov  lived?'  He  turned  a  rapid  but\nattentive  look  upon  all  three,  especially  upon\nRaskolnikov,  to  (cid:24)  whom  Sonia  was  speaking;\nthen looked back and noted the house. All this\nwas done in an instant as he passed, and trying", "not  to  betray  his  interest,  he  walked  on  more\nslowly as though waiting for something. He was\nwaiting for Sonia; he saw that they were parting,\nand that Sonia was going home.\n'Home?    Where?    I've    seen    that    face \nsomewhere,'  he thought. 'I must find out.'\nAt  the  turning  he  crossed  over,  looked  round,\nand saw Sonia coming the same way, noticing\nnothing. She turned the corner. He followed her\non  the  other  side.  After  about  fifty  paces  he\ncrossed over again, overtook her and kept two\nor three yards behind her.\nHe was a man about fifty, rather tall and thickly\nset, with broad high shoulders which made him\nlook  as  though  he  stooped  a  little.  He  wore\ngood and fashionable clothes, and looked like a\ngentleman  of  position.  He  carried  a  handsome\ncane, which he tapped on the pavement at each\nstep; his gloves were spotless. He had a broad,\nrather pleasant face with high cheek-bones and\na fresh colour, not often seen in Petersburg. His\nflaxen hair was still abundant, and only touched\nhere  and  there  with  grey,  and  his  thick  square\nbeard  was  even  lighter  than  his  hair.  His  eyes", "were  blue  and  had  a  cold  and  thoughtful  look;\nhis  lips  were  crimson.  He  was  a  remarkedly\nwell-preserved  man  and  looked  much  younger\nthan his years.\nWhen Sonia came out on the canal bank, they\nwere the only two persons on the pavement. He\nobserved  her  dreaminess  and  preoccupation.\nOn  reaching  the  house  where  she  lodged,\nSonia  turned  in  at  the  gate;  he  followed  her,\nseem-(cid:24)(cid:24)  ing  rather  surprised.  In  the  courtyard\nshe  turned  to  the  right  corner.  'Bah!'  muttered\nthe  unknown  gentleman,  and  mounted  the\nstairs behind her. Only then Sonia noticed him.\nShe  reached  the  third  storey,  turned  down  the\npassage,  and  rang  at  No.  9.  On  the  door  was\ninscribed in chalk, 'Kapernaumov, Tailor.' 'Bah!'\nthe  stranger  repeated  again,  wondering  at  the\nstrange coincidence, and he rang next door, at\nNo. 8. The doors were two or three yards apart.\n'You lodge at Kapernaumov's,' he said, looking\nat  Sonia  and  laughing.  'He  altered  a  waistcoat\nfor  me  yesterday.  I  am  staying  close  here  at\nMadame Resslich's. How odd!' Sonia looked at\nhim attentively.", "'We  are  neighbours,'  he  went  on  gaily.  'I  only\ncame  to  town  the  day  before  yesterday.\nGood-bye for the present.'\nSonia made no reply; the door opened and she\nslipped  in.  She  felt  for  some  reason  ashamed\nand uneasy.\nOn  the  way  to  Porfiry's,  Razumihin  was\nobviously excited.\n'That's  capital,  brother,'  he  repeated  several\ntimes, 'and I am glad! I am glad!'\n'What are you glad about?' Raskolnikov thought\nto himself.\n'I didn't know that you pledged things at the old\nwoman's, too. And ... was it long ago? I mean,\nwas it long since you were there?'\n'What a simple-hearted fool he is!'\n'When  was  it?'  Raskolnikov  stopped  still  to\nrecollect. 'Two or three days before her death it\nmust have been. But (cid:24) I am not going to redeem\nthe things now,' he put in with a sort of hurried", "and  conspicuous  solicitude  about  the  things.\n'I've  not  more  than  a  silver  rouble  left  ...  after\nlast night's accursed delirium!'\nHe laid special emphasis on the delirium.\n'Yes,  yes,'  Razumihin  hastened  to  agree-with\nwhat  was  not  clear.  'Then  that's  why  you  ...\nwere stuck ... partly ... you know in your delirium\nyou  were  continually  mentioning  some  rings  or\nchains!  Yes,  yes  ...  that's  clear,  it's  all  clear\nnow.'\n'Hullo!  How  that  idea  must  have  got  about\namong them. Here this man will go to the stake\nfor  me,  and  I  find  him  delighted  at  having  it\ncleared up why I spoke of rings in my delirium!\nWhat a hold the idea must have on all of them!'\n'Shall we find him?' he asked suddenly.\n'Oh, yes,' Razumihin answered quickly. 'He is a\nnice  fellow,  you  will  see,  brother.  Rather\nclumsy, that is to say, he is a man of polished\nmanners,  but  I  mean  clumsy  in  a  different\nsense. He is an intelligent fellow, very much so\nindeed, but he has his own range of ideas.... He", "is  incredulous,  sceptical,  cynical  ...  he  likes  to\nimpose  on  people,  or  rather  to  make  fun  of\nthem.  His  is  the  old,  circumstantial  method....\nBut  he  understands  his  work  ...  thoroughly....\nLast  year  he  cleared  up  a  case  of  murder  in\nwhich the police had hardly a clue. He is very,\nvery anxious to make your acquaintance!'\n'On what grounds is he so anxious?'\n'Oh,  it's  not  exactly  ...  you  see,  since  you've\nbeen ill I happen to have mentioned you several\ntimes.... So, when he heard about you ... about\nyour being a law student and (cid:24)(cid:24) not able to finish\nyour  studies,  he  said,  'What  a  pity!'  And  so  I\nconcluded ... from everything together, not only\nthat; yesterday Zametov ... you know, Rodya, I\ntalked some nonsense on the way home to you\nyesterday,  when  I  was  drunk  ...  I  am  afraid,\nbrother, of your exaggerating it, you see.'\n'What? That they think I am a madman? Maybe\nthey are right,' he said with a constrained smile.\n'Yes,  yes....  That  is,  pooh,  no!  ...  But  all  that  I\nsaid (and there was something else too) it was\nall nonsense, drunken nonsense.'", "'But why are you apologising? I am so sick of it\nall!'  Raskolnikov  cried  with  exaggerated\nirritability. It was partly assumed, however.\n'I  know,  I  know,  I  understand.  Believe  me,  I\nunderstand. One's ashamed to speak of it.'\n'If you are ashamed, then don't speak of it.'\nBoth  were  silent.  Razumihin  was  more  than\necstatic  and  Raskolnikov  perceived  it  with\nrepulsion.  He  was  alarmed,  too,  by  what\nRazumihin had just said about Porfiry.\n'I shall have to pull a long face with him too,' he\nthought,  with  a  beating  heart,  and  he  turned\nwhite,  'and  do  it  naturally,  too.  But  the  most\nnatural  thing  would  be  to  do  nothing  at  all.\nCarefully  do  nothing  at  all!  No,  carefully  would\nnot  be  natural  again....  Oh,  well,  we  shall  see\nhow it turns out.... We shall see ... directly. Is it\na good thing to go or not? The butterfly flies to\nthe light. My heart is beating, that's what's bad!'\n'In this grey house,' said Razumihin.", "'The  most  important  thing,  does  Porfiry  know\nthat I was (cid:24)(cid:24)0 Crime and Punishment at the old\nhag's  flat  yesterday  ...  and  asked  about  the\nblood? I must find that out instantly, as soon as\nI  go  in,  find  out  from  his  face;  otherwise  ...  I'll\nfind out, if it's my ruin.'\n'I  say,  brother,'  he  said  suddenly,  addressing\nRazumihin,  with  a  sly  smile,  'I  have  been\nnoticing  all  day  that  you  seem  to  be  curiously\nexcited. Isn't it so?'\n'Excited? Not a bit of it,' said Razumihin, stung\nto the quick.\n'Yes, brother, I assure you it's noticeable. Why,\nyou sat on your chair in a way you never do sit,\non  the  edge  somehow,  and  you  seemed  to  be\nwrithing  all  the  time.  You  kept  jumping  up  for\nnothing. One moment you were angry, and the\nnext  your  face  looked  like  a  sweetmeat.  You\neven blushed; especially when you were invited\nto dinner, you blushed awfully.'\n'Nothing  of  the  sort,  nonsense!  What  do  you\nmean?'", "'But  why  are  you  wriggling  out  of  it,  like  a\nschoolboy? By Jove, there he's blushing again.'\n'What a pig you are!'\n'But  why  are  you  so  shamefaced  about  it?\nRomeo! Stay, I'll tell of you to-day. Ha-ha-ha! I'll\nmake mother laugh, and someone else, too ...'\n'Listen,  listen,  listen,  this  is  serious....  What\nnext,  you  fiend!'  Razumihin  was  utterly\noverwhelmed,  turning  cold  with  horror.  'What\nwill you tell them? Come, brother ... foo! what a\npig you are!'\n'You  are  like  a  summer  rose.  And  if  only  you\nknew  how  it  suits  you;  a  Romeo  over  six  foot\nhigh!  And  how  you've  washed  to-day-you\ncleaned  your  nails,  I  declare.  Eh?  That's  (cid:24)1\nsomething unheard of! Why, I do believe you've\ngot pomatum on your hair! Bend down.''Pig!'\nRaskolnikov  laughed  as  though  he  could  not\nrestrain  himself.  So  laughing,  they  entered\nPorfiry  Petrovitch's  flat.  This  is  what\nRaskolnikov  wanted:  from  within  they  could  be\nheard  laughing  as  they  came  in,  still  guffawing", "in the passage.\n'Not a word here or I'll ... brain you!' Razumihin\nwhispered furiously, seizing Raskolnikov by the\nshoulder.(cid:24) ", "#$#$Chapter 21#$#$\nRaskolnikov was already entering the room. He\ncame in \nlooking  as  though  he  had  the  utmost  difficulty\nnot  to  burst  out  laughing  again.  Behind  him\nRazumihin  strode  in  gawky  and  awkward,\nshamefaced and red as a peony, with an utterly\ncrestfallen  and  ferocious  expression.  His  face\nand  whole  figure  really  were  ridiculous  at  that\nmoment  and  amply  justified  Raskolnikov's\nlaughter.  Raskolnikov,  not  waiting  for  an\nintroduction,  bowed  to  Porfiry  Petrovitch,  who\nstood  in  the  middle  of  the  room  looking\ninquiringly  at  them.  He  held  out  his  hand  and\nshook hands, still apparently making desperate\nefforts  to  subdue  his  mirth  and  utter  a  few\nwords  to  introduce  himself.  But  he  had  no\nsooner  succeeded  in  assuming  a  serious  air\nand  muttering  something  when  he  suddenly\nglanced  again  as  though  accidentally  at\nRazumihin, and could no longer control himself:\nhis  stifled  laughter  broke  out  the  more\nirresistibly  the  more  he  tried  to  restrain  it.  The", "extraordinary  ferocity  with  which  Razumihin\nreceived  this  'spontaneous'  mirth  gave  the\nwhole  scene  the  appearance  of  most  genuine\nfun  and  naturalness.  Razumihin  strengthened\nthis impression as though on purpose.\n'Fool!  You  fiend,'  he  roared,  waving  his  arm\nwhich at once struck a little round table with an\nempty  tea-glass  on  it.  Everything  was  sent\nflying and crashing.\n'But  why  break  chairs,  gentlemen?  You  know\nit's  a  loss  to  (cid:24)(cid:24)  the  Crown,'  Porfiry  Petrovitch\nquoted gaily.\nRaskolnikov was still laughing, with his hand in\nPorfiry Petrovitch's, but anxious not to overdo it,\nawaited the right moment to put a natural end to\nit.  Razumihin,  completely  put  to  confusion  by\nupsetting  the  table  and  smashing  the  glass,\ngazed  gloomily  at  the  fragments,  cursed  and\nturned  sharply  to  the  window  where  he  stood\nlooking out with his back to the company with a\nfiercely  scowling  countenance,  seeing  nothing.\nPorfiry Petrovitch laughed and was ready to go\non  laughing,  but  obviously  looked  for\nexplanations.  Zametov  had  been  sitting  in  the", "corner, but he rose at the visitors' entrance and\nwas standing in expectation with a smile on his\nlips, though he looked with surprise and even it\nseemed  incredulity  at  the  whole  scene  and  at\nRaskolnikov  with  a  certain  embarrassment.\nZametov's  unexpected  presence  struck\nRaskolnikov unpleasantly.\n'I've  got  to  think  of  that,'  he  thought.  'Excuse\nme,  please,'  he  began,  affecting  extreme\nembarrassment. 'Raskolnikov.'\n'Not at all, very pleasant to see you ... and how\npleasantly  you've  come  in....  Why,  won't  he\neven  say  good-morning?'  Porfiry  Petrovitch\nnodded at Razumihin.\n'Upon my honour I don't know why he is in such\na  rage  with  me.  I  only  told  him  as  we  came\nalong that he was like Romeo ... and proved it.\nAnd that was all, I think!'\n'Pig!'  ejaculated  Razumihin,  without  turning\nround.\n'There must have been very grave grounds for\nit,  if  he  is  so  furious  at  the  word,'  Porfiry", "laughed.\n'Oh,  you  sharp  lawyer!  ...  Damn  you  all!'\nsnapped Razumihin, and suddenly bursting out\nlaughing himself, he went (cid:24) up to Porfiry with a\nmore  cheerful  face  as  though  nothing  had\nhappened. 'That'll do! We are all fools. To come\nto  business.  This  is  my  friend  Rodion\nRomanovitch  Raskolnikov;  in  the  first  place  he\nhas  heard  of  you  and  wants  to  make  your\nacquaintance,  and  secondly,  he  has  a  little\nmatter  of  business  with  you.  Bah!  Zametov,\nwhat brought you here? Have you met before?\nHave you known each other long?'\n'What  does  this  mean?'  thought  Raskolnikov\nuneasily.\nZametov  seemed  taken  aback,  but  not  very\nmuch so.\n'Why,  it  was  at  your  rooms  we  met  yesterday,'\nhe said easily.\n'Then  I  have  been  spared  the  trouble.  All  last\nweek  he  was  begging  me  to  introduce  him  to\nyou. Porfiry and you have sniffed each other out", "without me. Where is your tobacco?'\nPorfiry  Petrovitch  was  wearing  a\ndressing-gown,  very  clean  linen,  and\ntrodden-down slippers. He was a man of about\nfive  and  thirty,  short,  stout  even  to  corpulence,\nand  clean  shaven.  He  wore  his  hair  cut  short\nand  had  a  large  round  head,  particularly\nprominent  at  the  back.  His  soft,  round,  rather\nsnub-nosed  face  was  of  a  sickly  yellowish\ncolour,  but  had  a  vigorous  and  rather  ironical\nexpression.  It  would  have  been  good-natured\nexcept for a look in the eyes, which shone with\na  watery,  mawkish  light  under  almost  white,\nblinking  eyelashes.  The  expression  of  those\neyes  was  strangely  out  of  keeping  with  his\nsomewhat  womanish  figure,  and  gave  it\nsomething  far  more  serious  than  could  be\nguessed at first sight.\nAs  soon  as  Porfiry  Petrovitch  heard  that  his\nvisitor  had  a  little  matter  of  business  with  him,\nhe begged him to sit (cid:24)(cid:24) down on the sofa and sat\ndown himself on the other end, waiting for him\nto  explain  his  business,  with  that  careful  and\nover-serious  attention  which  is  at  once\noppressive  and  embarrassing,  especially  to  a", "stranger,  and  especially  if  what  you  are\ndiscussing  is  in  your  opinion  of  far  too  little\nimportance  for  such  exceptional  solemnity.  But\nin  brief  and  coherent  phrases  Raskolnikov\nexplained his business clearly and exactly, and\nwas  so  well  satisfied  with  himself  that  he  even\nsucceeded  in  taking  a  good  look  at  Porfiry.\nPorfiry Petrovitch did not once take his eyes off\nhim.  Razumihin,  sitting  opposite  at  the  same\ntable,  listened  warmly  and  impatiently,  looking\nfrom one to the other every moment with rather\nexcessive interest.\n'Fool,' Raskolnikov swore to himself.\n'You  have  to  give  information  to  the  police,'\nPorfiry replied, with a most businesslike air, 'that\nhaving  learnt  of  this  incident,  that  is  of  the\nmurder, you beg to inform the lawyer in charge\nof the case that such and such things belong to\nyou,  and  that  you  desire  to  redeem  them  ...  or\n... but they will write to you.'\n'That's  just  the  point,  that  at  the  present\nmoment,'  Raskolnikov  tried  his  utmost  to  feign\nembarrassment, 'I am not quite in funds ... and\neven  this  trifling  sum  is  beyond  me  ...  I  only", "wanted, you see, for the present to declare that\nthe  things  are  mine,  and  that  when  I  have\nmoney....'\n'That's  no  matter,'  answered  Porfiry  Petrovitch,\nreceiving  his  explanation  of  his  pecuniary\nposition coldly, 'but you can, if you prefer, write\nstraight  to  me,  to  say,  that  having  been\ninformed  of  the  matter,  and  claiming  such  and\nsuch  (cid:24)  as  your  property,  you  beg  ...''On    an \nordinary    sheet    of    paper?'    Raskolnikov \ninterrupted  eagerly,  again  interested  in  the\nfinancial side of the question.\n'Oh,  the  most  ordinary,'  and  suddenly  Porfiry\nPetrovitch  looked  with  obvious  irony  at  him,\nscrewing up his eyes and, as it were, winking at\nhim. But perhaps it was Raskolnikov's fancy, for\nit  all  lasted  but  a  moment.  There  was  certainly\nsomething  of  the  sort,  Raskolnikov  could  have\nsworn he winked at him, goodness knows why.\n'He  knows,'  flashed  through  his  mind  like\nlightning.\n'Forgive my troubling you about such trifles,' he\nwent  on,  a  little  disconcerted,  'the  things  are", "only  worth  five  roubles,  but  I  prize  them\nparticularly  for  the  sake  of  those  from  whom\nthey came to me, and I must confess that I was\nalarmed when I heard ...'\n'That's  why  you  were  so  much  struck  when  I\nmentioned  to  Zossimov  that  Porfiry  was\ninquiring  for  everyone  who  had  pledges!'\nRazumihin put in with obvious intention.\nThis  was  really  unbearable.  Raskolnikov  could\nnot  help  glancing  at  him  with  a  flash  of\nvindictive  anger  in  his  black  eyes,  but\nimmediately recollected himself.\n'You seem to be jeering at me, brother?' he said\nto him, with a well- feigned irritability. 'I dare say\nI  do  seem  to  you  absurdly  anxious  about  such\ntrash;  but  you  mustn't  think  me  selfish  or\ngrasping for that, and these two things may be\nanything  but  trash  in  my  eyes.  I  told  you  just\nnow that the silver watch, though it's not worth a\ncent, is the only thing left us of my father's. You\nmay laugh at me, but my mother (cid:24)(cid:24) is here,' he\nturned suddenly to Porfiry, 'and if she knew,' he\nturned  again  hurriedly  to  Razumihin,  carefully\nmaking  his  voice  tremble,  'that  the  watch  was", "lost,  she  would  be  in  despair!  You  know  what\nwomen are!'\n'Not a bit of it! I didn't mean that at all! Quite the\ncontrary!' shouted Razumihin distressed.\n'Was  it  right?  Was  it  natural?  Did  I  overdo  it?'\nRaskolnikov asked himself in a tremor. 'Why did\nI say that about women?'\n'Oh, your mother is with you?' Porfiry Petrovitch\ninquired.'Yes.'\n'When did she come?'\n'Last night.'\nPorfiry paused as though reflecting.\n'Your  things  would  not  in  any  case  be  lost,'  he\nwent  on  calmly  and  coldly.  'I  have  been\nexpecting you here for some time.'\nAnd  as  though  that  was  a  matter  of  no\nimportance, he carefully offered the ash-tray to\nRazumihin,  who  was  ruthlessly  scattering\ncigarette  ash  over  the  carpet.  Raskolnikov", "shuddered,  but  Porfiry  did  not  seem  to  be\nlooking  at  him,  and  was  still  concerned  with\nRazumihin's cigarette.\n'What? Expecting him? Why, did you know that\nhe had pledges there?' cried Razumihin.\nPorfiry  Petrovitch  addressed  himself  to\nRaskolnikov.\n'Your  things,  the  ring  and  the  watch,  were\nwrapped  up  together,  and  on  the  paper  your\nname was legibly written in pencil, together with\nthe date on which you left them with (cid:24) her ...'\n'How  observant  you  are!'  Raskolnikov  smiled\nawkwardly,  doing  his  very  utmost  to  look  him\nstraight in the face, but he failed, and suddenly\nadded:\n'I say that because I suppose there were a great\nmany  pledges  ...  that  it  must  be  difficult  to\nremember  them  all....  But  you  remember  them\nall so clearly, and ... and ...'\n'Stupid!  Feeble!'  he  thought.  'Why  did  I  add\nthat?'", "'But we know all who had pledges, and you are\nthe  only  one  who  hasn't  come  forward,'  Porfiry\nanswered with hardly perceptible irony.\n'I haven't been quite well.'\n'I heard that too. I heard, indeed, that you were\nin  great  distress  about  something.  You  look\npale still.'\n'I  am  not  pale  at  all....  No,  I  am  quite  well,'\nRaskolnikov  snapped  out  rudely  and  angrily,\ncompletely  changing  his  tone.  His  anger  was\nmounting,  he  could  not  repress  it.  'And  in  my\nanger I shall betray myself,' flashed through his\nmind again. 'Why are they torturing me?'\n'Not quite well!' Razumihin caught him up. 'What\nnext!  He  was  unconscious  and  delirious  all\nyesterday.  Would  you  believe,  Porfiry,  as  soon\nas  our  backs  were  turned,  he  dressed,  though\nhe could hardly stand, and gave us the slip and\nwent  off  on  a  spree  somewhere  till  midnight,\ndelirious  all  the  time!  Would  you  believe  it!\nExtraordinary!'", "'Really  delirious?  You  don't  say  so!'  Porfiry\nshook his head in a womanish way.\n'Nonsense!  Don't  you  believe  it!  But  you  don't\nbelieve  it  anyway,'  Raskolnikov  let  slip  in  his\nanger. But Porfiry Petro-(cid:24)(cid:24) vitch did not seem to\ncatch those strange words.\n'But how could you have gone out if you hadn't\nbeen  delirious?'  Razumihin  got  hot  suddenly.\n'What did you go out for? What was the object\nof  it?  And  why  on  the  sly?  Were  you  in  your\nsenses when you did it? Now that all danger is\nover I can speak plainly.'\n'I  was  awfully  sick  of  them  yesterday.'\nRaskolnikov  addressed  Porfiry  suddenly  with  a\nsmile  of  insolent  defiance,  'I  ran  away  from\nthem to take lodgings where they wouldn't find\nme,  and  took  a  lot  of  money  with  me.  Mr.\nZametov there saw it. I say, Mr. Zametov, was I\nsensible  or  delirious  yesterday;  settle  our\ndispute.'\nHe  could  have  strangled  Zametov  at  that\nmoment, so hateful were his expression and his\nsilence to him.", "'In  my  opinion  you  talked  sensibly  and  even\nartfully,  but  you  were  extremely  irritable,'\nZametov pronounced dryly.\n'And  Nikodim  Fomitch  was  telling  me  to-day,'\nput  in  Porfiry  Petrovitch,  'that  he  met  you  very\nlate last night in the lodging of a man who had\nbeen run over.'\n'And  there,'  said  Razumihin,  'weren't  you  mad\nthen?  You  gave  your  last  penny  to  the  widow\nfor  the  funeral.  If  you  wanted  to  help,  give\nfifteen  or  twenty  even,  but  keep  three  roubles\nfor  yourself  at  least,  but  he  flung  away  all  the\ntwentyfive at once!'\n'Maybe I found a treasure somewhere and you\nknow  nothing  of  it?  So  that's  why  I  was  liberal\nyesterday....  Mr.  Zametov  knows  I've  found  a\ntreasure!  Excuse  us,  please,  for  disturbing  you\nfor  half  an  hour  with  such  trivialities,'  he  said,\nturning to Porfiry Petrovitch, with trembling lips.\n'We (cid:24)(cid:24)0 Crime and Punishment are boring you,\naren't we?'\n'Oh no, quite the contrary, quite the contrary! If", "only  you  knew  how  you  interest  me!  It's\ninteresting  to  look  on  and  listen  ...  and  I  am\nreally glad you have come forward at last.'\n'But  you  might  give  us  some  tea!  My  throat's\ndry,' cried Razumihin.\n'Capital  idea!  Perhaps  we  will  all  keep  you\ncompany. Wouldn't you like ... something more\nessential before tea?'\n'Get along with you!'\nPorfiry Petrovitch went out to order tea.\nRaskolnikov's thoughts were in a whirl. He was\nin terrible exasperation.\n'The  worst  of  it  is  they  don't  disguise  it;  they\ndon't  care  to  stand  on  ceremony!  And  how  if\nyou didn't know me at all, did you come to talk\nto  Nikodim  Fomitch  about  me?  So  they  don't\ncare  to  hide  that  they  are  tracking  me  like  a\npack of dogs. They simply spit in my face.' He\nwas  shaking  with  rage.  'Come,  strike  me\nopenly,  don't  play  with  me  like  a  cat  with  a\nmouse.  It's  hardly  civil,  Porfiry  Petrovitch,  but", "perhaps I won't allow it! I shall get up and throw\nthe whole truth in your ugly faces, and you'll see\nhow  I  despise  you.'  He  could  hardly  breathe.\n'And  what  if  it's  only  my  fancy?  What  if  I  am\nmistaken, and through inexperience I get angry\nand  don't  keep  up  my  nasty  part?  Perhaps  it's\nall unintentional. All their phrases are the usual\nones, but there is something about them.... It all\nmight be said, but there is something. Why did\nhe  say  bluntly,  'With  her'?  Why  did  Zametov\nadd that I spoke artfully? Why do they speak in\n(cid:24)1  that  tone?  Yes,  the  tone....  Razumihin  is\nsitting  here,  why  does  he  see  nothing?  That\ninnocent  blockhead  never  does  see  anything!\nFeverish  again!  Did  Porfiry  wink  at  me  just\nnow?  Of  course  it's  nonsense!  What  could  he\nwink for? Are they trying to upset my nerves or\nare they teasing me? Either it's ill fancy or they\nknow!  Even  Zametov  is  rude....  Is  Zametov\nrude?  Zametov  has  changed  his  mind.  I\nforesaw  he  would  change  his  mind!  He  is  at\nhome here, while it's my first visit. Porfiry does\nnot  consider  him  a  visitor;  sits  with  his  back  to\nhim. They're as thick as thieves, no doubt, over\nme!  Not  a  doubt  they  were  talking  about  me\nbefore we came. Do they know about the flat? If\nonly they'd make haste! When I said that I ran", "away to take a flat he let it pass.... I put that in\ncleverly  about  a  flat,  it  may  be  of  use\nafterwards.... Delirious, indeed ... ha-ha-ha! He\nknows all about last night! He didn't know of my\nmother's  arrival!  The  hag  had  written  the  date\non  in  pencil!  You  are  wrong,  you  won't  catch\nme!  There  are  no  facts  ...  it's  all  supposition!\nYou produce facts! The flat even isn't a fact but\ndelirium. I know what to say to them.... Do they\nknow  about  the  flat?  I  won't  go  without  finding\nout.  What  did  I  come  for?  But  my  being  angry\nnow,  maybe  is  a  fact!  Fool,  how  irritable  I  am!\nPerhaps that's right; to play the invalid.... He is\nfeeling  me.  He  will  try  to  catch  me.  Why  did  I\ncome?'\nAll this flashed like lightning through his mind.\nPorfiry  Petrovitch  returned  quickly.  He  became\nsuddenly more jovial.\n'Your party yesterday, brother, has left my head\nrather....  And  I  am  out  of  sorts  altogether,'  he\nbegan  in  quite  a  differ(cid:24)  ent  tone,  laughing  to\nRazumihin.\n'Was  it  interesting?  I  left  you  yesterday  at  the", "most interesting point. Who got the best of it?'\n'Oh,  no  one,  of  course.  They  got  on  to\neverlasting questions, floated off into space.'\n'Only  fancy,  Rodya,  what  we  got  on  to\nyesterday.  Whether  there  is  such  a  thing  as\ncrime. I told you that we talked our heads off.'\n'What  is  there  strange?  It's  an  everyday  social\nquestion,' Raskolnikov answered casually.\n'The  question  wasn't  put  quite  like  that,'\nobserved Porfiry.\n'Not  quite,  that's  true,'  Razumihin  agreed  at\nonce,  getting  warm  and  hurried  as  usual.\n'Listen, Rodion, and tell us your opinion, I want\nto hear it. I was fighting tooth and nail with them\nand  wanted  you  to  help  me.  I  told  them  you\nwere  coming....  It  began  with  the  socialist\ndoctrine.  You  know  their  doctrine;  crime  is  a\nprotest  against  the  abnormality  of  the  social\norganisation  and  nothing  more,  and  nothing\nmore; no other causes admitted! ...'\n'You  are  wrong  there,'  cried  Porfiry  Petrovitch;", "he  was  noticeably  animated  and  kept  laughing\nas  he  looked  at  Razumihin,  which  made  him\nmore excited than ever.\n'Nothing  is  admitted,'  Razumihin  interrupted\nwith heat.\n'I  am  not  wrong.  I'll  show  you  their  pamphlets.\nEverything  with  them  is  'the  influence  of\nenvironment,'  and  nothing  else.  Their  favourite\nphrase!  From  which  it  follows  that,  if  society  is\nnormally organised, all crime will cease at once,\nsince  there  will  be  nothing  to  protest  against\nand  all  (cid:24)(cid:24)  men  will  become  righteous  in  one\ninstant. Human nature is not taken into account,\nit  is  excluded,  it's  not  supposed  to  exist!  They\ndon't  recognise  that  humanity,  developing  by  a\nhistorical  living  process,  will  become  at  last  a\nnormal  society,  but  they  believe  that  a  social\nsystem  that  has  come  out  of  some\nmathematical  brain  is  going  to  organise  all\nhumanity at once and make it just and sinless in\nan  instant,  quicker  than  any  living  process!\nThat's  why  they  instinctively  dislike  history,\n'nothing  but  ugliness  and  stupidity  in  it,'  and\nthey  explain  it  all  as  stupidity!  That's  why  they\nso  dislike  the  living  process  of  life;  they  don't", "want a living soul! The living soul demands life,\nthe soul won't obey the rules of mechanics, the\nsoul  is  an  object  of  suspicion,  the  soul  is\nretrograde! But what they want though it smells\nof  death  and  can  be  made  of  India-rubber,  at\nleast is not alive, has no will, is servile and won't\nrevolt! And it comes in the end to their reducing\neverything  to  the  building  of  walls  and  the\nplanning  of  rooms  and  passages  in  a\nphalanstery!  The  phalanstery  is  ready,  indeed,\nbut  your  human  nature  is  not  ready  for  the\nphalanstery-it  wants  life,  it  hasn't  completed  its\nvital  process,  it's  too  soon  for  the  graveyard!\nYou  can't  skip  over  nature  by  logic.  Logic\npresupposes  three  possibilities,  but  there  are\nmillions! Cut away a million, and reduce it all to\nthe  question  of  comfort!  That's  the  easiest\nsolution  of  the  problem!  It's  seductively  clear\nand  you  musn't  think  about  it.  That's  the  great\nthing, you mustn't think! The whole secret of life\nin two pages of print!'\n'Now he is off, beating the drum! Catch hold of\nhim, do!' laughed Porfiry. 'Can you imagine,' he\nturned to Raskol(cid:24) nikov, 'six people holding forth\nlike that last night, in one room, with punch as a\npreliminary!  No,  brother,  you  are  wrong,", "environment accounts for a great deal in crime;\nI can assure you of that.'\n'Oh,  I  know  it  does,  but  just  tell  me:  a  man  of\nforty violates a child of ten; was it environment\ndrove him to it?'\n'Well,  strictly  speaking,  it  did,'  Porfiry  observed\nwith  noteworthy  gravity;  'a  crime  of  that  nature\nmay  be  very  well  ascribed  to  the  influence  of\nenvironment.'\nRazumihin  was  almost  in  a  frenzy.  'Oh,  if  you\nlike,' he roared. 'I'll prove to you that your white\neyelashes  may  very  well  be  ascribed  to  the\nChurch  of  Ivan  the  Great's  being  two  hundred\nand  fifty  feet  high,  and  I  will  prove  it  clearly,\nexactly,  progressively,  and  even  with  a  Liberal\ntendency! I undertake to! Will you bet on it?'\n'Done! Let's hear, please, how he will prove it!'\n'He is always humbugging, confound him,' cried\nRazumihin,  jumping  up  and  gesticulating.\n'What's  the  use  of  talking  to  you?  He  does  all\nthat  on  purpose;  you  don't  know  him,  Rodion!\nHe  took  their  side  yesterday,  simply  to  make", "fools of them. And the things he said yesterday!\nAnd they were delighted! He can keep it up for\na fortnight together. Last year he persuaded us\nthat he was going into a monastery: he stuck to\nit  for  two  months.  Not  long  ago  he  took  it  into\nhis  head  to  declare  he  was  going  to  get\nmarried,  that  he  had  everything  ready  for  the\nwedding.  He  ordered  new  clothes  indeed.  We\nall  began  to  congratulate  him.  There  was  no\nbride, nothing, all pure fantasy!'\n'Ah,  you  are  wrong!  I  got  the  clothes  before.  It\nwas  the  (cid:24)(cid:24)  new  clothes  in  fact  that  made  me\nthink of taking you in.'\n'Are you such a good dissembler?' Raskolnikov\nasked carelessly.\n'You wouldn't have supposed it, eh? Wait a bit, I\nshall take you in, too. Ha-ha-ha! No, I'll tell you\nthe  truth.  All  these  questions  about  crime,\nenvironment,  children,  recall  to  my  mind  an\narticle of yours which interested me at the time.\n'On  Crime'  ...  or  something  of  the  sort,  I  forget\nthe title, I read it with pleasure two months ago\nin the Periodical Review. '", "'My  article?  In  the  Periodical  Review?'\nRaskolnikov  asked  in  astonishment.  'I  certainly\ndid write an article upon a book six months ago\nwhen  I  left  the  university,  but  I  sent  it  to  the\nWeekly Review. '\n'But it came out in the Periodical. '\n'And  the  Weekly  Review  ceased  to  exist,  so\nthat's why it wasn't printed at the time.'\n'That's  true;  but  when  it  ceased  to  exist,  the\nWeekly  Review  was  amalgamated  with  the\nPeriodical  and  so  your  article  appeared  two\nmonths ago in the latter. Didn't you know?'\nRaskolnikov had not known.\n'Why,  you  might  get  some  money  out  of  them\nfor  the  article!  What  a  strange  person  you  are!\nYou  lead  such  a  solitary  life  that  you  know\nnothing of matters that concern you directly. It's\na fact, I assure you.'\n'Bravo,  Rodya!  I  knew  nothing  about  it  either!'\ncried  Razumihin.  'I'll  run  to-day  to  the\nreading-room  and  ask  for  the  number.  Two", "months  ago?  What  was  the  date?  It  doesn't  (cid:24)\nmatter  though,  I  will  find  it.  Think  of  not  telling\nus!'\n'How did you find out that the article was mine?\nIt's only signed with an initial.'\n'I  only  learnt  it  by  chance,  the  other  day.\nThrough  the  editor;  I  know  him....  I  was  very\nmuch interested.'\n'I analysed, if I remember, the psychology of a\ncriminal before and after the crime.'\n'Yes,  and  you  maintained  that  the  perpetration\nof  a  crime  is  always  accompanied  by  illness.\nVery, very original, but ... it was not that part of\nyour article that interested me so much, but an\nidea  at  the  end  of  the  article  which  I  regret  to\nsay you merely suggested without working it out\nclearly.  There  is,  if  you  recollect,  a  suggestion\nthat  there  are  certain  persons  who  can  ...  that\nis, not precisely are able to, but have a perfect\nright to commit breaches of morality and crimes,\nand that the law is not for them.'\nRaskolnikov  smiled  at  the  exaggerated  and", "intentional distortion of his idea.\n'What?  What  do  you  mean?  A  right  to  crime?\nBut  not  because  of  the  influence  of\nenvironment?'  Razumihin  inquired  with  some\nalarm even.\n'No, not exactly because of it,' answered Porfiry.\n'In his article all men are divided into 'ordinary'\nand 'extraordinary.' Ordinary men have to live in\nsubmission, have no right to transgress the law,\nbecause,  don't  you  see,  they  are  ordinary.  But\nextraordinary  men  have  a  right  to  commit  any\ncrime and to transgress the law in any way, just\nbecause they are extraordinary. That was your\nidea,  if  I  am  not  mistaken?'(cid:24)(cid:24)  'What  do  you\nmean? That can't be right?' Razumihin muttered\nin bewilderment.\nRaskolnikov  smiled  again.  He  saw  the  point  at\nonce,  and  knew  where  they  wanted  to  drive\nhim. He decided to take up the challenge.\n'That  wasn't  quite  my  contention,'  he  began\nsimply and modestly. 'Yet I admit that you have\nstated  it  almost  correctly;  perhaps,  if  you  like,\nperfectly  so.'  (It  almost  gave  him  pleasure  to", "admit  this.)  'The  only  difference  is  that  I  don't\ncontend  that  extraordinary  people  are  always\nbound  to  commit  breaches  of  morals,  as  you\ncall it. In fact, I doubt whether such an argument\ncould  be  published.  I  simply  hinted  that  an\n'extraordinary'  man  has  the  right  ...  that  is  not\nan  official  right,  but  an  inner  right  to  decide  in\nhis  own  conscience  to  overstep  ...  certain\nobstacles, and only in case it is essential for the\npractical  fulfilment  of  his  idea  (sometimes,\nperhaps,  of  benefit  to  the  whole  of  humanity).\nYou say that my article isn't definite; I am ready\nto make it as clear as I can. Perhaps I am right\nin thinking you want me to; very well. I maintain\nthat  if  the  discoveries  of  Kepler  and  Newton\ncould  not  have  been  made  known  except  by\nsacrificing the lives of one, a dozen, a hundred,\nor more men, Newton would have had the right,\nwould  indeed  have  been  in  duty  bound  ...  to\neliminate the dozen or the hundred men for the\nsake  of  making  his  discoveries  known  to  the\nwhole  of  humanity.  But  it  does  not  follow  from\nthat  that  Newton  had  a  right  to  murder  people\nright  and  left  and  to  steal  every  day  in  the\nmarket.  Then,  I  remember,  I  maintain  in  my\narticle that all ... well, legislators and leaders of (cid:24)\nmen,  such  as  Lycurgus,  Solon,  Mahomet,", "Napoleon, and so on, were all without exception\ncriminals, from the very fact that, making a new\nlaw, they transgressed the ancient one, handed\ndown  from  their  ancestors  and  held  sacred  by\nthe  people,  and  they  did  not  stop  short  at\nbloodshed  either,  if  that  bloodshed-often  of\ninnocent persons fighting bravely in defence of\nancient  law-were  of  use  to  their  cause.  It's\nremarkable, in fact, that the majority, indeed, of\nthese  benefactors  and  leaders  of  humanity\nwere  guilty  of  terrible  carnage.  In  short,  I\nmaintain that all great men or even men a little\nout  of  the  common,  that  is  to  say  capable  of\ngiving  some  new  word,  must  from  their  very\nnature  be  criminals-more  or  less,  of  course.\nOtherwise  it's  hard  for  them  to  get  out  of  the\ncommon rut; and to remain in the common rut is\nwhat they can't submit to, from their very nature\nagain,  and  to  my  mind  they  ought  not,  indeed,\nto  submit  to  it.  You  see  that  there  is  nothing\nparticularly new in all that. The same thing has\nbeen printed and read a thousand times before.\nAs  for  my  division  of  people  into  ordinary  and\nextraordinary, I acknowledge that it's somewhat\narbitrary, but I don't insist upon exact numbers. I\nonly believe in my leading idea that men are in\ngeneral  divided  by  a  law  of  nature  into  two", "categories, inferior (ordinary), that is, so to say,\nmaterial  that  serves  only  to  reproduce  its  kind,\nand men who have the gift or the talent to utter\na new word. There are, of course, innumerable\nsub- divisions, but the distinguishing features of\nboth categories are fairly well marked. The first\ncategory,  generally  speaking,  are  men\nconservative  in  temperament  and  law-abiding;\nthey  live  under  control  and  love  (cid:24)(cid:24)  to  be\ncontrolled.  To  my  thinking  it  is  their  duty  to  be\ncontrolled,  because  that's  their  vocation,  and\nthere  is  nothing  humiliating  in  it  for  them.  The\nsecond category all transgress the law; they are\ndestroyers or disposed to destruction according\nto their capacities. The crimes of these men are\nof course relative and varied; for the most part\nthey seek in very varied ways the destruction of\nthe  present  for  the  sake  of  the  better.  But  if\nsuch a one is forced for the sake of his idea to\nstep  over  a  corpse  or  wade  through  blood,  he\ncan,  I  maintain,  find  within  himself,  in  his\nconscience,  a  sanction  for  wading  through\nblood-that  depends  on  the  idea  and  its\ndimensions,  note  that.  It's  only  in  that  sense  I\nspeak  of  their  right  to  crime  in  my  article  (you\nremember  it  began  with  the  legal  question).\nThere's no need for such anxiety, however; the", "masses will scarcely ever admit this right, they\npunish  them  or  hang  them  (more  or  less),  and\nin  doing  so  fulfil  quite  justly  their  conservative\nvocation.  But  the  same  masses  set  these\ncriminals  on  a  pedestal  in  the  next  generation\nand  worship  them  (more  or  less).  The  first\ncategory is always the man of the present, the\nsecond the man of the future. The first preserve\nthe  world  and  people  it,  the  second  move  the\nworld and lead it to its goal. Each class has an\nequal right to exist. In fact, all have equal rights\nwith me-and vive la guerre éternelle-till the New\nJerusalem, of course!'\n'Then  you  believe  in  the  New  Jerusalem,  do\nyou?'\n'I  do,'  Raskolnikov  answered  firmly;  as  he  said\nthese  words  and  during  the  whole  preceding\ntirade  he  kept  his  eyes  on  one  spot  on  the\ncarpet.(cid:24)(cid:24)0 Crime and Punishment 'And ... and do\nyou believe in God? Excuse my curiosity.'\n'I do,' repeated Raskolnikov, raising his eyes to\nPorfiry.\n'And  ...  do  you  believe  in  Lazarus'  rising  from", "the dead?'\n'I ... I do. Why do you ask all this?'\n'You believe it literally?'\n'Literally.'\n'You  don't  say  so....  I  asked  from  curiosity.\nExcuse me. But let us go back to the question;\nthey  are  not  always  executed.  Some,  on  the\ncontrary ...'\n'Triumph in their lifetime? Oh, yes, some attain\ntheir ends in this life, and then ...'\n'They begin executing other people?'\n'If it's necessary; indeed, for the most part they\ndo. Your remark is very witty.'\n'Thank  you.  But  tell  me  this:  how  do  you\ndistinguish those extraordinary people from the\nordinary  ones?  Are  there  signs  at  their  birth?  I\nfeel  there  ought  to  be  more  exactitude,  more\nexternal definition. Excuse the natural anxiety of\na practical law-abiding citizen, but couldn't they", "adopt  a  special  uniform,  for  instance,  couldn't\nthey wear something, be branded in some way?\nFor you know if confusion arises and a member\nof one category imagines that he belongs to the\nother, begins to 'eliminate obstacles' as you so\nhappily expressed it, then ...'\n'Oh,  that  very  often  happens!  That  remark  is\nwittier than the other.'\n'Thank you.'\n'No  reason  to;  but  take  note  that  the  mistake\ncan  only  (cid:24)1  arise  in  the  first  category,  that  is\namong  the  ordinary  people  (as  I  perhaps\nunfortunately  called  them).  In  spite  of  their\npredisposition to obedience very many of them,\nthrough  a  playfulness  of  nature,  sometimes\nvouchsafed  even  to  the  cow,  like  to  imagine\nthemselves  advanced  people,  'destroyers,'  and\nto  push  themselves  into  the  'new  movement,'\nand  this  quite  sincerely.  Meanwhile  the  really\nnew people are very often unobserved by them,\nor even despised as reactionaries of grovelling\ntendencies.  But  I  don't  think  there  is  any\nconsiderable danger here, and you really need\nnot  be  uneasy  for  they  never  go  very  far.  Of", "course, they might have a thrashing sometimes\nfor letting their fancy run away with them and to\nteach  them  their  place,  but  no  more;  in  fact,\neven  this  isn't  necessary  as  they  castigate\nthemselves,  for  they  are  very  conscientious:\nsome  perform  this  service  for  one  another  and\nothers  chastise  themselves  with  their  own\nhands.... They will impose various public acts of\npenitence upon themselves with a beautiful and\nedifying  effect;  in  fact  you've  nothing  to  be\nuneasy about.... It's a law of nature.'\n'Well,  you  have  certainly  set  my  mind  more  at\nrest  on  that  score;  but  there's  another  thing\nworries  me.  Tell  me,  please,  are  there  many\npeople  who  have  the  right  to  kill  others,  these\nextraordinary people? I am ready to bow down\nto  them,  of  course,  but  you  must  admit  it's\nalarming if there are a great many of them, eh?'\n'Oh,  you  needn't  worry  about  that  either,'\nRaskolnikov went on in the same tone. 'People\nwith new ideas, people with the faintest capacity\nfor saying something new are (cid:24) extremely few in\nnumber,  extraordinarily  so  in  fact.  One  thing\nonly  is  clear,  that  the  appearance  of  all  these\ngrades  and  sub-divisions  of  men  must  follow", "with  unfailing  regularity  some  law  of  nature.\nThat law, of course, is unknown at present, but I\nam  convinced  that  it  exists,  and  one  day  may\nbecome  known.  The  vast  mass  of  mankind  is\nmere material, and only exists in order by some\ngreat  effort,  by  some  mysterious  process,  by\nmeans of some crossing of races and stocks, to\nbring into the world at last perhaps one man out\nof  a  thousand  with  a  spark  of  independence.\nOne  in  ten  thousand  perhaps-I  speak  roughly,\napproximately-is born with some independence,\nand  with  still  greater  independence  one  in  a\nhundred thousand. The man of genius is one of\nmillions,  and  the  great  geniuses,  the  crown  of\nhumanity, appear on earth perhaps one in many\nthousand millions. In fact I have not peeped into\nthe retort in which all this takes place. But there\ncertainly is and must be a definite law, it cannot\nbe a matter of chance.'\n'Why, are you both joking?' Razumihin cried at\nlast. 'There you sit, making fun of one another.\nAre you serious, Rodya?'\nRaskolnikov  raised  his  pale  and  almost\nmournful  face  and  made  no  reply.  And  the\nunconcealed,  persistent,  nervous,  and", "discourteous  sarcasm  of  Porfiry  seemed\nstrange  to  Razumihin  beside  that  quiet  and\nmournful face.\n'Well,  brother,  if  you  are  really  serious  ...  You\nare right, of course, in saying that it's not new,\nthat  it's  like  what  we've  read  and  heard  a\nthousand  times  already;  but  what  is  really\noriginal  in  all  this,  and  is  exclusively  your  own,\nto my (cid:24)(cid:24) horror, is that you sanction bloodshed in\nthe name of conscience and, excuse my saying\nso, with such fanaticism.... That, I take it, is the\npoint  of  your  article.  But  that  sanction  of\nbloodshed by conscience is to my mind ... more\nterrible  than  the  official,  legal  sanction  of\nbloodshed....'\n'You  are  quite  right,  it  is  more  terrible,'  Porfiry\nagreed.\n'Yes,  you  must  have  exaggerated!  There  is\nsome  mistake,  I  shall  read  it.  You  can't  think\nthat! I shall read it.'\n'All that is not in the article, there's only a hint of\nit,' said Raskolnikov.", "'Yes, yes.' Porfiry couldn't sit still. 'Your attitude\nto crime is pretty clear to me now, but ... excuse\nme for my impertinence (I am really ashamed to\nbe  worrying  you  like  this),  you  see,  you've\nremoved  my  anxiety  as  to  the  two  grades\ngetting mixed, but ... there are various practical\npossibilities  that  make  me  uneasy!  What  if\nsome  man  or  youth  imagines  that  he  is  a\nLycurgus  or  Mahomet-a  future  one  of\ncourse-and  suppose  he  begins  to  remove  all\nobstacles....  He  has  some  great  enterprise\nbefore him and needs money for it ... and tries\nto get it ... do you see?'\nZametov  gave  a  sudden  guffaw  in  his  corner.\nRaskolnikov did not even raise his eyes to him.\n'I  must  admit,'  he  went  on  calmly,  'that  such\ncases certainly must arise. The vain and foolish\nare particularly apt to fall into that snare; young\npeople especially.'\n'Yes, you see. Well then?'\n'What then?' Raskolnikov smiled in reply; 'that's\nnot my fault. So it is and so it always will be. He\nsaid  just  now  (he  nodded  at  Razumihin)  that  I", "sanction  bloodshed.  Society  is  (cid:24)  too  well\nprotected  by  prisons,  banishment,  criminal\ninvestigators,  penal  servitude.  There's  no  need\nto be uneasy. You have but to catch the thief.'\n'And what if we do catch him?'\n'Then he gets what he deserves.'\n'You  are  certainly  logical.  But  what  of  his\nconscience?'\n'Why do you care about that?'\n'Simply from humanity.'\n'If  he  has  a  conscience  he  will  suffer  for  his\nmistake. That will be his punishment-as well as\nthe prison.'\n'But  the  real  geniuses,'  asked  Razumihin\nfrowning, 'those who have the right to murder?\nOughtn't they to suffer at all even for the blood\nthey've shed?'\n'Why  the  word  ought?  It's  not  a  matter  of\npermission  or  prohibition.  He  will  suffer  if  he  is", "sorry  for  his  victim.  Pain  and  suffering  are\nalways  inevitable  for  a  large  intelligence  and  a\ndeep heart. The really great men must, I think,\nhave  great  sadness  on  earth,'  he  added\ndreamily, not in the tone of the conversation.\nHe raised his eyes, looked earnestly at them all,\nsmiled,  and  took  his  cap.  He  was  too  quiet  by\ncomparison  with  his  manner  at  his  entrance,\nand he felt this. Everyone got up.\n'Well,  you  may  abuse  me,  be  angry  with  me  if\nyou  like,'  Porfiry  Petrovitch  began  again,  'but  I\ncan't resist. Allow me one little question (I know\nI am troubling you). There is just one little notion\nI  want  to  express,  simply  that  I  may  not  forget\nit.'\n'Very  good,  tell  me  your  little  notion,'\nRaskolnikov  stood  waiting,  pale  and  grave\nbefore  him.(cid:24)(cid:24)  'Well,  you  see  ...  I  really  don't\nknow how to express it properly.... It's a playful,\npsychological  idea....  When  you  were  writing\nyour  article,  surely  you  couldn't  have  helped,\nhe-he!  fancying  yourself  ...  just  a  little,  an\n'extraordinary' man, uttering a new word in your\nsense.... That's so, isn't it?'", "'Quite  possibly,'  Raskolnikov  answered\ncontemptuously.\nRazumihin made a movement.\n'And,  if  so,  could  you  bring  yourself  in  case  of\nworldly  difficulties  and  hardship  or  for  some\nservice  to  humanity-to  overstep  obstacles?  ...\nFor instance, to rob and murder?'\nAnd  again  he  winked  with  his  left  eye,  and\nlaughed noiselessly just as before.\n'If  I  did  I  certainly  should  not  tell  you,'\nRaskolnikov answered with defiant and haughty\ncontempt.\n'No,  I  was  only  interested  on  account  of  your\narticle, from a literary point of view ...'\n'Foo!  how  obvious  and  insolent  that  is!'\nRaskolnikov thought with repulsion.\n'Allow me to observe,' he answered dryly, 'that I\ndon't  consider  myself  a  Mahomet  or  a\nNapoleon, nor any personage of that kind, and", "not  being  one  of  them  I  cannot  tell  you  how  I\nshould act.'\n'Oh,  come,  don't  we  all  think  ourselves\nNapoleons  now  in  Russia?'  Porfiry  Petrovitch\nsaid with alarming familiarity.\nSomething  peculiar  betrayed  itself  in  the  very\nintonation of his voice.\n'Perhaps  it  was  one  of  these  future  Napoleons\nwho  did  for  Alyona  Ivanovna  last  week?'\nZametov blurted out from (cid:24) the corner.\nRaskolnikov  did  not  speak,  but  looked  firmly\nand intently at Porfiry. Razumihin was scowling\ngloomily. He seemed before this to be noticing\nsomething.  He  looked  angrily  around.  There\nwas  a  minute  of  gloomy  silence.  Raskolnikov\nturned to go.\n'Are  you  going  already?'  Porfiry  said  amiably,\nholding out his hand with excessive politeness.\n'Very,  very  glad  of  your  acquaintance.  As  for\nyour request, have no uneasiness, write just as\nI  told  you,  or,  better  still,  come  to  me  there\nyourself in a day or two ... to-morrow, indeed. I", "shall be there at eleven o'clock for certain. We'll\narrange  it  all;  we'll  have  a  talk.  As  one  of  the\nlast  to  be  there  you  might  perhaps  be  able  to\ntell  us  something,'  he  added  with  a  most\ngood-natured expression.\n'You want to cross-examine me officially in due\nform?' \nRaskolnikov asked sharply.\n'Oh, why? That's not necessary for the present.\nYou  misunderstand  me.  I  lose  no  opportunity,\nyou  see,  and  ...  I've  talked  with  all  who  had\npledges....  I  obtained  evidence  from  some  of\nthem, and you are the last.... Yes, by the way,'\nhe  cried,  seemingly  suddenly  delighted,  'I  just\nremember, what was I thinking of?' he turned to\nRazumihin, 'you were talking my ears off about\nthat  Nikolay  ...  of  course,  I  know,  I  know  very\nwell,'  he  turned  to  Raskolnikov,  'that  the  fellow\nis  innocent,  but  what  is  one  to  do?  We  had  to\ntrouble Dmitri too.... This is the point, this is all:\nwhen you went up the stairs it was past seven,\nwasn't it?'\n'Yes,'  answered  Raskolnikov,  with  an", "unpleasant sensa-(cid:24)(cid:24) tion at the very moment he\nspoke that he need not have said it.\n'Then  when  you  went  upstairs  between  seven\nand  eight,  didn't  you  see  in  a  flat  that  stood\nopen  on  a  second  storey,  do  you  remember?\ntwo  workmen  or  at  least  one  of  them?  They\nwere painting there, didn't you notice them? It's\nvery, very important for them.'\n'Painters?  No,  I  didn't  see  them,'  Raskolnikov\nanswered  slowly,  as  though  ransacking  his\nmemory,  while  at  the  same  instant  he  was\nracking  every  nerve,  almost  swooning  with\nanxiety  to  conjecture  as  quickly  as  possible\nwhere the trap lay and not to overlook anything.\n'No, I didn't see them, and I don't think I noticed\na flat like that open.... But on the fourth storey'\n(he  had  mastered  the  trap  now  and  was\ntriumphant) 'I remember now that someone was\nmoving  out  of  the  flat  opposite  Alyona\nIvanovna's....  I  remember  ...  I  remember  it\nclearly.  Some  porters  were  carrying  out  a  sofa\nand  they  squeezed  me  against  the  wall.  But\npainters ... no, I don't remember that there were\nany painters, and I don't think that there was a\nflat open anywhere, no, there wasn't.'", "'What  do  you  mean?'  Razumihin  shouted\nsuddenly,  as  though  he  had  reflected  and\nrealised. 'Why, it was on the day of the murder\nthe  painters  were  at  work,  and  he  was  there\nthree days before? What are you asking?'\n'Foo! I have muddled it!' Porfiry slapped himself\non the forehead. 'Deuce take it! This business is\nturning my brain!' he  addressed  Raskolnikov \nsomewhat    apologetically.    'It  would  be  such  a\ngreat  thing  for  us  to  find  out  whether  anyone\nhad seen them between seven and eight at the\nflat, so I (cid:24) fancied you could perhaps have told\nus something.... I quite muddled it.'\n'Then  you  should  be  more  careful,'  Razumihin\nobserved grimly.\nThe  last  words  were  uttered  in  the  passage.\nPorfiry  Petrovitch  saw  them  to  the  door  with\nexcessive politeness.\nThey went out into the street gloomy and sullen,\nand  for  some  steps  they  did  not  say  a  word.\nRaskolnikov drew a deep breath.(cid:24)(cid:24) ", "#$#$Chapter 22#$#$\n'I  don't  believe  it,  I  can't  believe  it!'  repeated\nRazumihin, \ntrying  in  perplexity  to  refute  Raskolnikov's\narguments.\nThey  were  by  now  approaching  Bakaleyev's\nlodgings,  where  Pulcheria  Alexandrovna  and\nDounia had been expecting them a long while.\nRazumihin kept stopping on the way in the heat\nof discussion, confused and excited by the very\nfact  that  they  were  for  the  first  time  speaking\nopenly about it.\n'Don't  believe  it,  then!'  answered  Raskolnikov,\nwith  a  cold,  careless  smile.  'You  were  noticing\nnothing  as  usual,  but  I  was  weighing  every\nword.'\n'You  are  suspicious.  That  is  why  you  weighed\ntheir words ... h'm ... certainly, I agree, Porfiry's\ntone  was  rather  strange,  and  still  more  that\nwretch  Zametov!  ...  You  are  right,  there  was", "something about him-but why? Why?'\n'He has changed his mind since last night.'\n'Quite  the  contrary!  If  they  had  that  brainless\nidea, they would do their utmost to hide it, and\nconceal  their  cards,  so  as  to  catch  you\nafterwards....  But  it  was  all  impudent  and\ncareless.'\n'If  they  had  had  facts-I  mean,  real  facts-or  at\nleast  grounds  for  suspicion,  then  they  would\ncertainly  have  tried  to  hide  their  game,  in  the\nhope of getting more (they would have made a\nsearch  long  ago  besides).  But  they  have  no\nfacts, (cid:24)(cid:24)0 Crime and Punishment not one. It is all\nmirage-all  ambiguous.  Simply  a  floating  idea.\nSo they try to throw me out by impudence. And\nperhaps, he was irritated at having no facts, and\nblurted it out in his vexation-or perhaps he has\nsome  plan  ...  he  seems  an  intelligent  man.\nPerhaps  he  wanted  to  frighten  me  by\npretending to know. They have a psychology of\ntheir own, brother. But it is loathsome explaining\nit all. Stop!'\n'And  it's  insulting,  insulting!  I  understand  you.", "But ... since we have spoken openly now (and it\nis  an  excellent  thing  that  we  have  at  last-I  am\nglad)  I  will  own  now  frankly  that  I  noticed  it  in\nthem long ago, this idea. Of course the merest\nhint  only-an  insinuation-but  why  an  insinuation\neven?  How  dare  they?  What  foundation  have\nthey? If only you knew how furious I have been.\nThink  only!  Simply  because  a  poor  student,\nunhinged  by  poverty  and  hypochondria,  on  the\neve  of  a  severe  delirious  illness  (note  that),\nsuspicious,  vain,  proud,  who  has  not  seen  a\nsoul  to  speak  to  for  six  months,  in  rags  and  in\nboots without soles, has to face some wretched\npolicemen and put up with their insolence; and\nthe unexpected debt thrust under his nose, the\nI.O.U.  presented  by  Tchebarov,  the  new  paint,\nthirty  degrees  Reaumur  and  a  stifling\natmosphere,  a  crowd  of  people,  the  talk  about\nthe murder of a person where he had been just\nbefore,  and  all  that  on  an  empty  stomach-he\nmight  well  have  a  fainting  fit!  And  that,  that  is\nwhat  they  found  it  all  on!  Damn  them!

I'd hit out in all directions,\nneatly too, and so I'd put an end (cid:24)1 to it. Damn", "them! Don't be downhearted. It's a shame!'\n'He  really  has  put  it  well,  though,'  Raskolnikov\nthought.\n'Damn them? But the cross-examination again,\nto-morrow?'  he  said  with  bitterness.  'Must  I\nreally  enter  into  explanations  with  them?  I  feel\nvexed as it is, that I condescended to speak to\nZametov yesterday in the restaurant....'\n'Damn  it!  I  will  go  myself  to  Porfiry.  I  will\nsqueeze it out of him, as one of the family: he\nmust let me know the ins and outs of it all! And\nas for Zametov ...'\n'At  last  he  sees  through  him!'  thought\nRaskolnikov.\n'Stay!'  cried  Razumihin,  seizing  him  by  the\nshoulder  again.  'Stay!  you  were  wrong.  I  have\nthought  it  out.  You  are  wrong!  How  was  that  a\ntrap?  You  say  that  the  question  about  the\nworkmen  was  a  trap.  But  if  you  had  done  that\ncould  you  have  said  you  had  seen  them\npainting  the  flat  ...  and  the  workmen?  On  the\ncontrary, you would have seen nothing, even if", "you  had  seen  it.  Who  would  own  it  against\nhimself?'\n'If I had done that thing I should certainly have\nsaid that I had seen the workmen and the flat,'\nRaskolnikov  answered,  with  reluctance  and\nobvious disgust.\n'But why speak against yourself?'\n'Because  only  peasants,  or  the  most\ninexperienced  novices  deny  everything  flatly  at\nexaminations.  If  a  man  is  ever  so  little\ndeveloped and experienced, he will certainly try\nto  admit  all  the  external  facts  that  can't  be\navoided,  but  will  seek  other  explanations  of\nthem,  will  introduce  some  special,  unexpected\nturn,  that  will  give  them  another  significance\nand put them in another light. Porfiry might well\nreckon (cid:24) that I should be sure to answer so, and\nsay I had seen them to give an air of truth, and\nthen make some explanation.'\n'But  he  would  have  told  you  at  once  that  the\nworkmen  could  not  have  been  there  two  days\nbefore, and that therefore you must have been\nthere on the day of the murder at eight o'clock.", "And so he would have caught you over a detail.'\n'Yes,  that  is  what  he  was  reckoning  on,  that  I\nshould not have time to reflect, and should be in\na hurry to make the most likely answer, and so\nwould  forget  that  the  workmen  could  not  have\nbeen there two days before.'\n'But how could you forget it?'\n'Nothing  easier.  It  is  in  just  such  stupid  things\nclever people are most easily caught. The more\ncunning a man is, the less he suspects that he\nwill  be  caught  in  a  simple  thing.  The  more\ncunning a man is, the simpler the trap he must\nbe  caught  in.  Porfiry  is  not  such  a  fool  as  you\nthink....'\n'He is a knave then, if that is so!'\nRaskolnikov could not help laughing. But at the\nvery moment, he was struck by the strangeness\nof  his  own  frankness,  and  the  eagerness  with\nwhich he had made this explanation, though he\nhad kept up all the preceding conversation with\ngloomy repulsion, obviously with a motive, from\nnecessity.", "'I  am  getting  a  relish  for  certain  aspects!'  he\nthought  to  himself.  But  almost  at  the  same\ninstant he became suddenly uneasy, as though\nan unexpected and alarming idea had occurred\nto him. His uneasiness kept on increasing. They\nhad just reached the entrance to Bakaleyev's.\n'Go in alone!' said Raskolnikov suddenly. 'I will\nbe back (cid:24)(cid:24) directly.'\n'Where are you going? Why, we are just here.'\n'I can't help it.... I will come in half an hour. Tell\nthem.'\n'Say what you like, I will come with you.'\n'You,  too,  want  to  torture  me!'  he  screamed,\nwith  such  bitter  irritation,  such  despair  in  his\neyes that Razumihin's hands dropped. He stood\nfor some time on the steps, looking gloomily at\nRaskolnikov  striding  rapidly  away  in  the\ndirection of his lodging. At last, gritting his teeth\nand  clenching  his  fist,  he  swore  he  would\nsqueeze Porfiry like a lemon that very day, and\nwent  up  the  stairs  to  reassure  Pulcheria", "Alexandrovna, who was by now alarmed at their\nlong absence.\nWhen  Raskolnikov  got  home,  his  hair  was\nsoaked  with  sweat  and  he  was  breathing\nheavily.  He  went  rapidly  up  the  stairs,  walked\ninto his unlocked room and at once fastened the\nlatch. Then in senseless terror he rushed to the\ncorner,  to  that  hole  under  the  paper  where  he\nhad  put  the  things;  put  his  hand  in,  and  for\nsome minutes felt carefully in the hole, in every\ncrack and fold of the paper. Finding nothing, he\ngot  up  and  drew  a  deep  breath.  As  he  was\nreaching the steps of Bakaleyev's, he suddenly\nfancied that something, a chain, a stud or even\na bit of paper in which they had been wrapped\nwith  the  old  woman's  handwriting  on  it,  might\nsomehow  have  slipped  out  and  been  lost  in\nsome crack, and then might suddenly turn up as\nunexpected, conclusive evidence against him.\nHe  stood  as  though  lost  in  thought,  and  a\nstrange,  humiliated,  half  senseless  smile\nstrayed on his lips. He took his (cid:24) cap at last and\nwent quietly out of the room. His ideas were all\ntangled. He went dreamily through the gateway.", "'Here he is himself,' shouted a loud voice.\nHe raised his head.\nThe porter was standing at the door of his little\nroom and was pointing him out to a short man\nwho looked like an artisan, wearing a long coat\nand  a  waistcoat,  and  looking  at  a  distance\nremarkably like a woman. He stooped, and his\nhead  in  a  greasy  cap  hung  forward.  From  his\nwrinkled  flabby  face  he  looked  over  fifty;  his\nlittle  eyes  were  lost  in  fat  and  they  looked  out\ngrimly, sternly and discontentedly.\n'What is it?' Raskolnikov asked, going up to the\nporter.\nThe  man  stole  a  look  at  him  from  under  his\nbrows  and  he  looked  at  him  attentively,\ndeliberately; then he turned slowly and went out\nof the gate into the street without saying a word.\n'What is it?' cried Raskolnikov.\n'Why,  he  there  was  asking  whether  a  student\nlived  here,  mentioned  your  name  and  whom\nyou lodged with. I saw you coming and pointed", "you out and he went away. It's funny.'\nThe  porter  too  seemed  rather  puzzled,  but  not\nmuch so, and after wondering for a moment he\nturned and went back to his room.\nRaskolnikov ran after the stranger, and at once\ncaught sight of him walking along the other side\nof the street with the same even, deliberate step\nwith his eyes fixed on the ground, as though in\nmeditation. He soon overtook him, but for some\ntime walked behind him. At last, moving on (cid:24)(cid:24) to\na level with him, he looked at his face. The man\nnoticed him at once, looked at him quickly, but\ndropped his eyes again; and so they walked for\na minute side by side without uttering a word.\n'You were inquiring for me ... of the porter?' \nRaskolnikov said at last, but in a curiously quiet\nvoice.\nThe man made no answer; he didn't even look\nat him. Again they were both silent.\n'Why do you ... come and ask for me ... and say\nnothing.... What's the meaning of it?'", "Raskolnikov's  voice  broke  and  he  seemed\nunable to articulate the words clearly.\nThe man raised his eyes this time and turned a\ngloomy sinister look at \nRaskolnikov.\n'Murderer!' he said suddenly in a quiet but clear\nand distinct voice.\nRaskolnikov  went  on  walking  beside  him.  His\nlegs felt suddenly weak, a cold shiver ran down\nhis spine, and his heart seemed to stand still for\na  moment,  then  suddenly  began  throbbing  as\nthough  it  were  set  free.  So  they  walked  for\nabout a hundred paces, side by side in silence.\nThe man did not look at him.\n'What  do  you  mean  ...  what  is....  Who  is  a\nmurderer?' muttered \nRaskolnikov hardly audibly.\n'You  are  a  murderer,'  the  man  answered  still", "more articulately and emphatically, with a smile\nof  triumphant  hatred,  and  again  he  looked\nstraight into \nRaskolnikov's pale face and stricken eyes.\nThey  had  just  reached  the  cross-roads.  The\nman  turned  (cid:24)  to  the  left  without  looking  behind\nhim.  Raskolnikov  remained  standing,  gazing\nafter  him.  He  saw  him  turn  round  fifty  paces\naway and look back at him still standing there.\nRaskolnikov  could  not  see  clearly,  but  he\nfancied  that  he  was  again  smiling  the  same\nsmile of cold hatred and triumph.\nWith  slow  faltering  steps,  with  shaking  knees,\nRaskolnikov  made  his  way  back  to  his  little\ngarret,  feeling  chilled  all  over.  He  took  off  his\ncap and put it on the table, and for ten minutes\nhe  stood  without  moving.  Then  he  sank\nexhausted on the sofa and with a weak moan of\npain  he  stretched  himself  on  it.  So  he  lay  for\nhalf an hour.\nHe  thought  of  nothing.  Some  thoughts  or\nfragments  of  thoughts,  some  images  without\norder  or  coherence  floated  before  his", "mind-faces  of  people  he  had  seen  in  his\nchildhood  or  met  somewhere  once,  whom  he\nwould  never  have  recalled,  the  belfry  of  the\nchurch  at  V.,  the  billiard  table  in  a  restaurant\nand some officers playing billiards, the smell of\ncigars  in  some  underground  tobacco  shop,  a\ntavern  room,  a  back  staircase  quite  dark,  all\nsloppy  with  dirty  water  and  strewn  with\negg-shells, and the Sunday bells floating in from\nsomewhere....  The  images  followed  one\nanother, whirling like a hurricane. Some of them\nhe  liked  and  tried  to  clutch  at,  but  they  faded\nand all the while there was an oppression within\nhim, but it was not overwhelming, sometimes it\nwas  even  pleasant....  The  slight  shivering  still\npersisted,  but  that  too  was  an  almost  pleasant\nsensation.\nHe heard the hurried footsteps of Razumihin; he\nclosed  his  eyes  and  pretended  to  be  asleep.\nRazumihin  opened  the  (cid:24)(cid:24)  door  and  stood  for\nsome time in the doorway as though hesitating,\nthen  he  stepped  softly  into  the  room  and  went\ncautiously  to  the  sofa.  Raskolnikov  heard\nNastasya's whisper:\n'Don't  disturb  him!  Let  him  sleep.  He  can  have", "his dinner later.'\n'Quite so,' answered Razumihin. Both withdrew\ncarefully and closed the door. Another half-hour\npassed.  Raskolnikov  opened  his  eyes,  turned\non  his  back  again,  clasping  his  hands  behind\nhis head.\n'Who is he? Who is that man who sprang out of\nthe earth? Where was he, what did he see? He\nhas seen it all, that's clear. Where was he then?\nAnd  from  where  did  he  see?  Why  has  he  only\nnow sprung out of the earth? And how could he\nsee?  Is  it  possible?  Hm  ...'  continued\nRaskolnikov,  turning  cold  and  shivering,  'and\nthe  jewel  case  Nikolay  found  behind  the\ndoor-was  that  possible?  A  clue?  You  miss  an\ninfinitesimal  line  and  you  can  build  it  into  a\npyramid of evidence! A fly flew by and saw it! Is\nit  possible?'  He  felt  with  sudden  loathing  how\nweak,  how  physically  weak  he  had  become.  'I\nought to have known it,' he thought with a bitter\nsmile.  'And  how  dared  I,  knowing  myself,\nknowing  how  I  should  be,  take  up  an  axe  and\nshed  blood!  I  ought  to  have  known\nbeforehand.... Ah, but I did know!' he whispered\nin  despair.  At  times  he  came  to  a  standstill  at", "some thought.\n'No,  those  men  are  not  made  so.  The  real\nMaster to whom all is permitted storms Toulon,\nmakes a massacre in Paris, forgets an army in\nEgypt, wastes half a million men in the Moscow\nexpedition and gets off with a jest at Vilna. And\nal(cid:24) tars are set up to him after his death, and so\nall is permitted. No, such people, it seems, are\nnot of flesh but of bronze!'\nOne  sudden  irrelevant  idea  almost  made  him\nlaugh. Napoleon, the pyramids, Waterloo, and a\nwretched skinny old woman, a pawnbroker with\na  red  trunk  under  her  bed-it's  a  nice  hash  for\nPorfiry Petrovitch to digest! How can they digest\nit! It's too inartistic. 'A Napoleon creep under an\nold woman's bed! Ugh, how loathsome!'\nAt moments he felt he was raving. He sank into\na state of feverish excitement. 'The old woman\nis  of  no  consequence,'  he  thought,  hotly  and\nincoherently.  'The  old  woman  was  a  mistake\nperhaps,  but  she  is  not  what  matters!  The  old\nwoman was only an illness.... I was in a hurry to\noverstep....  I  didn't  kill  a  human  being,  but  a\nprinciple!  I  killed  the  principle,  but  I  didn't", "overstep,  I  stopped  on  this  side....  I  was  only\ncapable  of  killing.  And  it  seems  I  wasn't  even\ncapable of that ... Principle? Why was that fool\nRazumihin  abusing  the  socialists?  They  are\nindustrious,  commercial  people;  'the  happiness\nof all' is their case. No, life is only given to me\nonce  and  I  shall  never  have  it  again;  I  don't\nwant to wait for 'the happiness of all.' I want to\nlive myself, or else better not live at all. I simply\ncouldn't  pass  by  my  mother  starving,  keeping\nmy  rouble  in  my  pocket  while  I  waited  for  the\n'happiness of all.' I am putting my little brick into\nthe  happiness  of  all  and  so  my  heart  is  at\npeace. Ha-ha! Why have you let me slip? I only\nlive  once,  I  too  want....  Ech,  I  am  an  æsthetic\nlouse  and  nothing  more,'  he  added  suddenly,\nlaughing like a madman. 'Yes, I am certainly a\nlouse,'  he  went  on,  clutching  at  the  idea,\ngloating over it and playing with it with vindic-(cid:24)(cid:24)\ntive  pleasure.  'In  the  first  place,  because  I  can\nreason  that  I  am  one,  and  secondly,  because\nfor  a  month  past  I  have  been  troubling\nbenevolent Providence, calling it to witness that\nnot  for  my  own  fleshly  lusts  did  I  undertake  it,\nbut  with  a  grand  and  noble  object-  ha-ha!\nThirdly,  because  I  aimed  at  carrying  it  out  as\njustly  as  possible,  weighing,  measuring  and", "calculating. Of all the lice I picked out the most\nuseless one and proposed to take from her only\nas much as I needed for the first step, no more\nnor  less  (so  the  rest  would  have  gone  to  a\nmonastery,  according  to  her  will,  ha-ha!).  And\nwhat shows that I am utterly a louse,' he added,\ngrinding his teeth, 'is that I am perhaps viler and\nmore loathsome than the louse I killed, and I felt\nbeforehand  that  I  should  tell  myself  so  after\nkilling her. Can anything be compared with the\nhorror  of  that?  The  vulgarity!  The  abjectness!  I\nunderstand  the  'prophet'  with  his  sabre,  on  his\nsteed: Allah commands and 'trembling' creation\nmust  obey!  The  'prophet'  is  right,  he  is  right\nwhen  he  sets  a  battery  across  the  street  and\nblows  up  the  innocent  and  the  guilty  without\ndeigning  to  explain!  It's  for  you  to  obey,\ntrembling  creation,  and  not  to  have  desires  for\nthat's not for you! ... I shall never, never forgive\nthe old woman!'\nHis  hair  was  soaked  with  sweat,  his  quivering\nlips  were  parched,  his  eyes  were  fixed  on  the\nceiling.\n'Mother, sister-how I loved them! Why do I hate\nthem  now?  Yes,  I  hate  them,  I  feel  a  physical", "hatred for them, I can't bear them near me.... I\nwent  up  to  my  mother  and  kissed  her,  I\nremember....  To  embrace  her  and  think  if  she\nonly  knew  ...  shall  I  tell  her  then?  That's  just\nwhat  I  might  (cid:24)(cid:24)0  Crime  and  Punishment  do....\nShe  must  be  the  same  as  I  am,'  he  added,\nstraining  himself  to  think,  as  it  were  struggling\nwith  delirium.  'Ah,  how  I  hate  the  old  woman\nnow! I feel I should kill her again if she came to\nlife! Poor Lizaveta! Why did she come in? ... It's\nstrange though, why is it I scarcely ever think of\nher,  as  though  I  hadn't  killed  her?  Lizaveta!\nSonia!  Poor  gentle  things,  with  gentle  eyes....\nDear women! Why don't they weep? Why don't\nthey  moan?  They  give  up  everything  ...  their\neyes are soft and gentle.... Sonia, Sonia! Gentle\nSonia!'\nHe  lost  consciousness;  it  seemed  strange  to\nhim that he didn't remember how he got into the\nstreet.  It  was  late  evening.  The  twilight  had\nfallen  and  the  full  moon  was  shining  more  and\nmore  brightly;  but  there  was  a  peculiar\nbreathlessness in the air. There were crowds of\npeople  in  the  street;  workmen  and  business\npeople  were  making  their  way  home;  other\npeople  had  come  out  for  a  walk;  there  was  a", "smell  of  mortar,  dust  and  stagnant  water.\nRaskolnikov  walked  along,  mournful  and\nanxious;  he  was  distinctly  aware  of  having\ncome  out  with  a  purpose,  of  having  to  do\nsomething  in  a  hurry,  but  what  it  was  he  had\nforgotten.  Suddenly  he  stood  still  and  saw  a\nman  standing  on  the  other  side  of  the  street,\nbeckoning  to  him.  He  crossed  over  to  him,  but\nat  once  the  man  turned  and  walked  away  with\nhis  head  hanging,  as  though  he  had  made  no\nsign  to  him.  'Stay,  did  he  really  beckon?'\nRaskolnikov wondered, but he tried to overtake\nhim.  When  he  was  within  ten  paces  he\nrecognised  him  and  was  frightened;  it  was  the\nsame  man  with  stooping  shoulders  in  the  long\ncoat. Raskolnikov followed him at a (cid:24)1 distance;\nhis  heart  was  beating;  they  went  down  a\nturning;  the  man  still  did  not  look  round.  'Does\nhe  know  I  am  following  him?'  thought\nRaskolnikov. The man went into the gateway of\na big house. Raskolnikov hastened to the gate\nand  looked  in  to  see  whether  he  would  look\nround  and  sign  to  him.  In  the  court-yard  the\nman  did  turn  round  and  again  seemed  to\nbeckon  him.  Raskolnikov  at  once  followed  him\ninto  the  yard,  but  the  man  was  gone.  He  must\nhave  gone  up  the  first  staircase.  Raskolnikov", "rushed  after  him.  He  heard  slow  measured\nsteps  two  flights  above.  The  staircase  seemed\nstrangely  familiar.  He  reached  the  window  on\nthe  first  floor;  the  moon  shone  through  the\npanes  with  a  melancholy  and  mysterious  light;\nthen  he  reached  the  second  floor.  Bah!  this  is\nthe  flat  where  the  painters  were  at  work  ...  but\nhow was it he did not recognise it at once? The\nsteps of the man above had died away. 'So he\nmust  have  stopped  or  hidden  somewhere.'  He\nreached  the  third  storey,  should  he  go  on?\nThere  was  a  stillness  that  was  dreadful....  But\nhe  went  on.  The  sound  of  his  own  footsteps\nscared  and  frightened  him.  How  dark  it  was!\nThe  man  must  be  hiding  in  some  corner  here.\nAh!  the  flat  was  standing  wide  open,  he\nhesitated  and  went  in.  It  was  very  dark  and\nempty in the passage, as though everything had\nbeen  removed;  he  crept  on  tiptoe  into  the\nparlour  which  was  flooded  with  moonlight.\nEverything there was as before, the chairs, the\nlooking-glass,  the  yellow  sofa  and  the  pictures\nin the frames. A huge, round, copper-red moon\nlooked  in  at  the  windows.  'It's  the  moon  that\nmakes  it  so  still,  weaving  some  mystery,'\nthought  Raskolnikov.  He  stood  and  waited,\nwaited  a  long  while,  and  the  (cid:24)  more  silent  the", "moonlight, the more violently his heart beat, till\nit  was  painful.  And  still  the  same  hush.\nSuddenly  he  heard  a  momentary  sharp  crack\nlike  the  snapping  of  a  splinter  and  all  was  still\nagain.  A  fly  flew  up  suddenly  and  struck  the\nwindow  pane  with  a  plaintive  buzz.  At  that\nmoment  he  noticed  in  the  corner  between  the\nwindow and the little cupboard something like a\ncloak  hanging  on  the  wall.  'Why  is  that  cloak\nhere?' he thought, 'it wasn't there before....' He\nwent  up  to  it  quietly  and  felt  that  there  was\nsomeone hiding behind it. He cautiously moved\nthe  cloak  and  saw,  sitting  on  a  chair  in  the\ncorner,  the  old  woman  bent  double  so  that  he\ncouldn't see her face; but it was she. He stood\nover  her.  'She  is  afraid,'  he  thought.  He\nstealthily  took  the  axe  from  the  noose  and\nstruck her one blow, then another on the skull.\nBut  strange  to  say  she  did  not  stir,  as  though\nshe  were  made  of  wood.  He  was  frightened,\nbent  down  nearer  and  tried  to  look  at  her;  but\nshe,  too,  bent  her  head  lower.  He  bent  right\ndown to the ground and peeped up into her face\nfrom  below,  he  peeped  and  turned  cold  with\nhorror: the old woman was sitting and laughing,\nshaking  with  noiseless  laughter,  doing  her\nutmost that he should not hear it. Suddenly he", "fancied  that  the  door  from  the  bedroom  was\nopened a little and that there was laughter and\nwhispering within. He was overcome with frenzy\nand  he  began  hitting  the  old  woman  on  the\nhead with all his force, but at every blow of the\naxe  the  laughter  and  whispering  from  the\nbedroom  grew  louder  and  the  old  woman  was\nsimply  shaking  with  mirth.  He  was  rushing\naway,  but  the  passage  was  full  of  people,  the\ndoors  of  the  flats  stood  open  and  on  the\nlanding,  on  the  stairs  (cid:24)(cid:24)  and  everywhere  below\nthere  were  people,  rows  of  heads,  all  looking,\nbut huddled together in silence and expectation.\nSomething  gripped  his  heart,  his  legs  were\nrooted  to  the  spot,  they  would  not  move....  He\ntried to scream and woke up.\nHe  drew  a  deep  breath-but  his  dream  seemed\nstrangely  to  persist:  his  door  was  flung  open\nand  a  man  whom  he  had  never  seen  stood  in\nthe doorway watching him intently.\nRaskolnikov had hardly opened his eyes and he\ninstantly closed them again. He lay on his back\nwithout stirring.\n'Is  it  still  a  dream?'  he  wondered  and  again", "raised  his  eyelids  hardly  perceptibly;  the\nstranger  was  standing  in  the  same  place,  still\nwatching him.\nHe  stepped  cautiously  into  the  room,  carefully\nclosing the door after him, went up to the table,\npaused  a  moment,  still  keeping  his  eyes  on\nRaskolnikov, and noiselessly seated himself on\nthe chair by the sofa; he put his hat on the floor\nbeside  him  and  leaned  his  hands  on  his  cane\nand his chin on his hands. It was evident that he\nwas  prepared  to  wait  indefinitely.  As  far  as\nRaskolnikov  could  make  out  from  his  stolen\nglances, he was a man no longer young, stout,\nwith a full, fair, almost whitish beard.\nTen  minutes  passed.  It  was  still  light,  but\nbeginning  to  get  dusk.  There  was  complete\nstillness  in  the  room.  Not  a  sound  came  from\nthe  stairs.  Only  a  big  fly  buzzed  and  fluttered\nagainst the window pane. It was unbearable at\nlast. \nRaskolnikov  suddenly  got  up  and  sat  on  the\nsofa.\n'Come, tell me what you want.'", "'I  knew  you  were  not  asleep,  but  only\npretending,'  the  (cid:24)  stranger  answered  oddly,\nlaughing calmly. 'Arkady Ivanovitch Svidrigaïlov,\nallow me to introduce myself....'(cid:24)(cid:24) ", "#$#$Chapter 23#$#$\n(cid:24) ", "#$#$Chapter 24#$#$\n'Can  this  be  still  a  dream?'v  Raskolnikov\nthought once more.\nHe  looked  carefully  and  suspiciously  at  the\nunexpected visitor.\n'Svidrigaïlov!  What  nonsense!  It  can't  be!'  he\nsaid at last aloud in bewilderment.\nHis  visitor  did  not  seem  at  all  surprised  at  this\nexclamation.\n'I've  come  to  you  for  two  reasons.  In  the  first\nplace,  I  wanted  to  make  your  personal\nacquaintance,  as  I  have  already  heard  a  great\ndeal about you that is interesting and flattering;\nsecondly,  I  cherish  the  hope  that  you  may  not\nrefuse  to  assist  me  in  a  matter  directly\nconcerning  the  welfare  of  your  sister,  Avdotya\nRomanovna.  For  without  your  support  she\nmight not let me come near her now, for she is\nprejudiced against me, but with your assistance\nI reckon on ...'", "'You reckon wrongly,' interrupted Raskolnikov.\n'They only arrived yesterday, may I ask you?'\nRaskolnikov made no reply.\n'It  was  yesterday,  I  know.  I  only  arrived  myself\nthe day before. Well, let me tell you this, Rodion\nRomanovitch,  I  don't  consider  it  necessary  to\njustify myself, but kindly tell me what was there\nparticularly  criminal  on  my  part  in  all  this\nbusiness,  speaking  without  prejudice,  with\ncommon (cid:24)(cid:24) sense?'\nRaskolnikov continued to look at him in silence.\n'That  in  my  own  house  I  persecuted  a\ndefenceless  girl  and  'insulted  her  with  my\ninfamous proposals'-is that it? (I am anticipating\nyou.) But you've only to assume that I, too, am\na man et nihil humanum ... in a word, that I am\ncapable  of  being  attracted  and  falling  in  love\n(which  does  not  depend  on  our  will),  then\neverything can be explained in the most natural\nmanner. The question is, am I a monster, or am\nI myself a victim? And what if I am a victim? In", "proposing to the object of my passion to elope\nwith me to America or Switzerland, I may have\ncherished the deepest respect for her and may\nhave  thought  that  I  was  promoting  our  mutual\nhappiness! Reason is the slave of passion, you\nknow; why, probably, I was doing more harm to\nmyself than anyone!'\n'But that's not the point,' Raskolnikov interrupted\nwith  disgust.  'It's  simply  that  whether  you  are\nright or wrong, we dislike you. We don't want to\nhave anything to do with you. We show you the\ndoor. Go out!'\nSvidrigaïlov broke into a sudden laugh.\n'But you're ... but there's no getting round you,'\nhe  said,  laughing  in  the  frankest  way.  'I  hoped\nto get round you, but you took up the right line\nat once!'\n'But you are trying to get round me still!'\n'What  of  it?  What  of  it?'  cried  Svidrigaïlov,\nlaughing openly. 'But this is what the French call\nbonne  guerre  and  the  most  innocent  form  of\ndeception! ... But still you have interrupted me;", "one way or another, I repeat again: there would\nnever have been any unpleasantness except for\nwhat (cid:24) happened in the garden. Marfa Petrovna\n...'\n'You  have  got  rid  of  Marfa  Petrovna,  too,  so\nthey say?' \nRaskolnikov  interrupted  rudely.'Oh,    you've \nheard    that,    too,    then?    You'd    be    sure    to,\nthough.... But as for your question, I really don't\nknow what to say, though my own conscience is\nquite at rest on that score. Don't suppose that I\nam  in  any  apprehension  about  it.  All  was\nregular  and  in  order;  the  medical  inquiry\ndiagnosed apoplexy due to bathing immediately\nafter  a  heavy  dinner  and  a  bottle  of  wine,  and\nindeed it could have proved nothing else. But I'll\ntell  you  what  I  have  been  thinking  to  myself  of\nlate,  on  my  way  here  in  the  train,  especially:\ndidn't I contribute to all that ... calamity, morally,\nin  a  way,  by  irritation  or  something  of  the  sort.\nBut I came to the conclusion that that, too, was\nquite out of the question.'\nRaskolnikov laughed.", "'I wonder you trouble yourself about it!'\n'But what are you laughing at? Only consider, I\nstruck her just twice with a switch-there were no\nmarks  even  ...  don't  regard  me  as  a  cynic,\nplease;  I  am  perfectly  aware  how  atrocious  it\nwas  of  me  and  all  that;  but  I  know  for  certain,\ntoo, that Marfa Petrovna was very likely pleased\nat  my,  so  to  say,  warmth.  The  story  of  your\nsister  had  been  wrung  out  to  the  last  drop;  for\nthe  last  three  days  Marfa  Petrovna  had  been\nforced to sit at home; she had nothing to show\nherself with in the town. Besides, she had bored\nthem  so  with  that  letter  (you  heard  about  her\nreading  the  letter).  And  all  of  a  sudden  those\ntwo switches fell from heaven! Her first act was\nto  order  the  carriage  to  be  got  out....  Not  to\nspeak  of  the  (cid:24)(cid:24)  fact  that  there  are  cases  when\nwomen  are  very,  very  glad  to  be  insulted  in\nspite of all their show of indignation. There are\ninstances  of  it  with  everyone;  human  beings  in\ngeneral,  indeed,  greatly  love  to  be  insulted,\nhave  you  noticed  that?  But  it's  particularly  so\nwith women. One might even say it's their only\namusement.'\nAt  one  time  Raskolnikov  thought  of  getting  up", "and  walking  out  and  so  finishing  the  interview.\nBut some curiosity and even a sort of prudence\nmade him linger for a moment.\n'You are fond of fighting?' he asked carelessly.\n'No,  not  very,'  Svidrigaïlov  answered,  calmly.\n'And Marfa Petrovna and I scarcely ever fought.\nWe  lived  very  harmoniously,  and  she  was\nalways  pleased  with  me.  I  only  used  the  whip\ntwice in all our seven years (not counting a third\noccasion  of  a  very  ambiguous  character).  The\nfirst  time,  two  months  after  our  marriage,\nimmediately after we arrived in the country, and\nthe last time was that of which we are speaking.\nDid you suppose I was such a monster, such a\nreactionary, such a slave driver? Ha, ha! By the\nway,  do  you  remember,  Rodion  Romanovitch,\nhow  a  few  years  ago,  in  those  days  of\nbeneficent  publicity,  a  nobleman,  I've  forgotten\nhis name, was put to shame everywhere, in all\nthe  papers,  for  having  thrashed  a  German\nwoman  in  the  railway  train.  You  remember?  It\nwas in those days, that very year I believe, the\n'disgraceful  action  of  the  Age'  took  place  (you\nknow, 'The Egyptian Nights,' that public reading,\nyou  remember?  The  dark  eyes,  you  know!  Ah,", "the golden days of our youth, where are they?).\nWell,  as  for  the  gentleman  who  thrashed  the\nGerman, I feel no sympathy with him, because\n(cid:24)00 Crime and Punishment after all what need is\nthere  for  sympathy?  But  I  must  say  that  there\nare sometimes such provoking 'Germans' that I\ndon't  believe  there  is  a  progressive  who  could\nquite  answer  for  himself.  No  one  looked  at  the\nsubject  from  that  point  of  view  then,  but  that's\nthe truly humane point of view, I assure you.'\nAfter  saying  this,  Svidrigaïlov  broke  into  a\nsudden  laugh  again.  Raskolnikov  saw  clearly\nthat  this  was  a  man  with  a  firm  purpose  in  his\nmind and able to keep it to himself.\n'I  expect  you've  not  talked  to  anyone  for  some\ndays?' he asked.\n'Scarcely anyone. I suppose you are wondering\nat my being such an adaptable man?'\n'No,  I  am  only  wondering  at  your  being  too\nadaptable a man.'\n'Because I am not offended at the rudeness of\nyour  questions?  Is  that  it?  But  why  take", "offence?  As  you  asked,  so  I  answered,'  he\nreplied,  with  a  surprising  expression  of\nsimplicity.  'You  know,  there's  hardly  anything  I\ntake interest in,' he went on, as it were dreamily,\n'especially  now,  I've  nothing  to  do....  You  are\nquite  at  liberty  to  imagine  though  that  I  am\nmaking up to you with a motive, particularly as I\ntold  you  I  want  to  see  your  sister  about\nsomething.  But  I'll  confess  frankly,  I  am  very\nmuch bored. The last three days especially, so I\nam  delighted  to  see  you....  Don't  be  angry,\nRodion  Romanovitch,  but  you  seem  to  be\nsomehow  awfully  strange  yourself.  Say  what\nyou like, there's something wrong with you, and\nnow,  too  ...  not  this  very  minute,  I  mean,  but\nnow,  generally....  Well,  well,  I  won't,  I  won't,\ndon't scowl! I am 01 not such a bear, you know,\nas you think.'\nRaskolnikov looked gloomily at him.\n'You are not a bear, perhaps, at all,' he said. 'I\nfancy  indeed  that  you  are  a  man  of  very  good\nbreeding,  or  at  least  know  how  on  occasion  to\nbehave  like  one.''I    am    not    particularly \ninterested    in    anyone's    opinion,'  Svidrigaïlov\nanswered,  dryly  and  even  with  a  shade  of", "haughtiness, 'and therefore why not be vulgar at\ntimes when vulgarity is such a convenient cloak\nfor  our  climate  ...  and  especially  if  one  has  a\nnatural propensity that way,' he added, laughing\nagain.\n'But I've heard you have many friends here. You\nare,  as  they  say,  'not  without  connections.'\nWhat can you want with me, then, unless you've\nsome special object?'\n'That's true that I have friends here,' Svidrigaïlov\nadmitted,  not  replying  to  the  chief  point.  'I've\nmet some already. I've been lounging about for\nthe  last  three  days,  and  I've  seen  them,  or\nthey've  seen  me.  That's  a  matter  of  course.  I\nam well dressed and reckoned not a poor man;\nthe  emancipation  of  the  serfs  hasn't  affected\nme; my property consists chiefly of forests and\nwater meadows. The revenue has not fallen off;\nbut ... I am not going to see them, I was sick of\nthem  long  ago.  I've  been  here  three  days  and\nhave called on no one.... What a town it is! How\nhas  it  come  into  existence  among  us,  tell  me\nthat?  A  town  of  officials  and  students  of  all\nsorts.  Yes,  there's  a  great  deal  I  didn't  notice\nwhen I was here eight years ago, kicking up my", "heels....  My  only  hope  now  is  in  anatomy,  by\nJove, it is!'\n'Anatomy?'(cid:24)0(cid:24) Crime and Punishment 'But as for\nthese  clubs,  Dussauts,  parades,  or  progress,\nindeed, maybe -well, all that can go on without\nme,'  he  went  on,  again  without  noticing  the\nquestion.  'Besides,  who  wants  to  be  a\ncard-sharper?'\n'Why, have you been a card-sharper then?'\n'How  could  I  help  being?  There  was  a  regular\nset  of  us,  men  of  the  best  society,  eight  years\nago;  we  had  a  fine  time.  And  all  men  of\nbreeding,  you  know,  poets,  men  of  property.\nAnd indeed as a rule in our Russian society the\nbest  manners  are  found  among  those  who've\nbeen  thrashed,  have  you  noticed  that?  I've\ndeteriorated  in  the  country.  But  I  did  get  into\nprison for debt, through a low Greek who came\nfrom  Nezhin.  Then  Marfa  Petrovna  turned  up;\nshe  bargained  with  him  and  bought  me  off  for\nthirty  thousand  silver  pieces  (I  owed  seventy\nthousand).  We  were  united  in  lawful  wedlock\nand  she  bore  me  off  into  the  country  like  a\ntreasure.  You  know  she  was  five  years  older", "than  I.  She  was  very  fond  of  me.  For  seven\nyears  I  never  left  the  country.  And,  take  note,\nthat  all  my  life  she  held  a  document  over  me,\nthe IOU for thirty thousand roubles, so if I were\nto elect to be restive about anything I should be\ntrapped  at  once!  And  she  would  have  done  it!\nWomen find nothing incompatible in that.'\n'If it hadn't been for that, would you have given\nher the slip?'\n'I  don't  know  what  to  say.  It  was  scarcely  the\ndocument  restrained  me.  I  didn't  want  to  go\nanywhere  else.  Marfa  Petrovna  herself  invited\nme  to  go  abroad,  seeing  I  was  bored,  but  I've\nbeen abroad before, and always felt sick there.\nFor  no  reason,  but  the  sunrise,  the  bay  of\nNaples,  the  0(cid:24)  sea-you  look  at  them  and  it\nmakes  you  sad.  What's  most  revolting  is  that\none is really sad! No, it's better at home. Here\nat  least  one  blames  others  for  everything  and\nexcuses  oneself.  I  should  have  gone  perhaps\non an expedition to the North Pole, because j'ai\nle  vin  mauvais  and  hate  drinking,  and  there's\nnothing left but wine. I have tried it. But, I say,\nI've  been  told  Berg  is  going  up  in  a  great\nballoon next Sunday from the Yusupov Garden", "and will take up passengers at a fee. Is it true?'\n'Why, would you go up?'\n'I  ...  No,  oh,  no,'  muttered  Svidrigaïlov  really\nseeming to be deep in thought.\n'What  does  he  mean?  Is  he  in  earnest?'\nRaskolnikov wondered.\n'No,  the  document  didn't  restrain  me,'\nSvidrigaïlov  went  on,  meditatively.  'It  was  my\nown doing, not leaving the country, and nearly a\nyear  ago  Marfa  Petrovna  gave  me  back  the\ndocument  on  my  name-  day  and  made  me  a\npresent  of  a  considerable  sum  of  money,  too.\nShe  had  a  fortune,  you  know.  'You  see  how  I\ntrust  you,  Arkady  Ivanovitch'-  that  was  actually\nher  expression.  You  don't  believe  she  used  it?\nBut  do  you  know  I  managed  the  estate  quite\ndecently, they know me in the neighbourhood. I\nordered  books,  too.  Marfa  Petrovna  at  first\napproved, but afterwards she was afraid of my\nover-studying.'\n'You  seem  to  be  missing  Marfa  Petrovna  very\nmuch?'", "'Missing  her?  Perhaps.  Really,  perhaps  I  am.\nAnd, by the way, do you believe in ghosts?'\n'What ghosts?'(cid:24)0(cid:24) Crime and Punishment 'Why,\nordinary ghosts.'\n'Do you believe in them?'\n'Perhaps not, pour vous plaire.... I wouldn't say\nno exactly.'\n'Do you see them, then?'\nSvidrigaïlov looked at him rather oddly.\n'Marfa Petrovna is pleased to visit me,' he said,\ntwisting his mouth into a strange smile.\n'How do you mean 'she is pleased to visit you'?'\n'She has been three times. I saw her first on the\nvery  day  of  the  funeral,  an  hour  after  she  was\nburied. It was the day before I left to come here.\nThe second time was the day before yesterday,\nat  daybreak,  on  the  journey  at  the  station  of\nMalaya  Vishera,  and  the  third  time  was  two", "hours ago in the room where I am staying. I was\nalone.'\n'Were you awake?'\n'Quite  awake.  I  was  wide  awake  every  time.\nShe  comes,  speaks  to  me  for  a  minute  and\ngoes  out  at  the  door-always  at  the  door.  I  can\nalmost hear her.'\n'What made me think that something of the sort\nmust  be  happening  to  you?'  Raskolnikov  said\nsuddenly.\nAt  the  same  moment  he  was  surprised  at\nhaving said it. He was much excited.\n'What!  Did  you  think  so?'  Svidrigaïlov  asked  in\nastonishment.  'Did  you  really?  Didn't  I  say  that\nthere  was  something  in  common  between  us,\neh?'\n'You  never  said  so!'  Raskolnikov  cried  sharply\nand with heat.\n'Didn't I?'0(cid:24) 'No!'", "'I  thought  I  did.  When  I  came  in  and  saw  you\nlying  with  your  eyes  shut,  pretending,  I  said  to\nmyself at once, 'Here's the man.''\n'What do you mean by 'the man?' What are you\ntalking about?' cried Raskolnikov.\n'What  do  I  mean?  I  really  don't  know....'\nSvidrigaïlov  muttered  ingenuously,  as  though\nhe, too, were puzzled.\nFor  a  minute  they  were  silent.  They  stared  in\neach other's faces.\n'That's all nonsense!' Raskolnikov shouted with\nvexation. 'What does she say when she comes\nto you?'\n'She!  Would  you  believe  it,  she  talks  of  the\nsilliest  trifles  and-man  is  a  strange  creature-it\nmakes me angry. The first time she came in (I\nwas  tired  you  know:  the  funeral  service,  the\nfuneral ceremony, the lunch afterwards. At last I\nwas left alone in my study. I lighted a cigar and\nbegan  to  think),  she  came  in  at  the  door.\n'You've been so busy to-day, Arkady Ivanovitch,\nyou  have  forgotten  to  wind  the  dining-  room", "clock,'  she  said.  All  those  seven  years  I've\nwound  that  clock  every  week,  and  if  I  forgot  it\nshe  would  always  remind  me.  The  next  day  I\nset off on my way here. I got out at the station\nat daybreak; I'd been asleep, tired out, with my\neyes  half  open,  I  was  drinking  some  coffee.  I\nlooked  up  and  there  was  suddenly  Marfa\nPetrovna sitting beside me with a pack of cards\nin  her  hands.  'Shall  I  tell  your  fortune  for  the\njourney,  Arkady  Ivanovitch?'  She  was  a  great\nhand  at  telling  fortunes.  I  shall  never  forgive\nmyself  for  not  asking  her  to.  I  ran  away  in  a\nfright, and, besides, the bell rang. (cid:24)0(cid:24) Crime and\nPunishment  I  was  sitting  to-day,  feeling  very\nheavy  after  a  miserable  dinner  from  a\ncookshop; I was sitting smoking, all of a sudden\nMarfa Petrovna again. She came in very smart\nin  a  new  green  silk  dress  with  a  long  train.\n'Good day, Arkady Ivanovitch! How do you like\nmy dress? Aniska can't make like this.' (Aniska\nwas  a  dressmaker  in  the  country,  one  of  our\nformer  serf  girls  who  had  been  trained  in\nMoscow,  a  pretty  wench.)  She  stood  turning\nround  before  me.  I  looked  at  the  dress,  and\nthen  I  looked  carefully,  very  carefully,  at  her\nface. 'I wonder you trouble to come to me about\nsuch  trifles,  Marfa  Petrovna.'  'Good  gracious,", "you  won't  let  one  disturb  you  about  anything!'\nTo tease her I said, 'I want to get married, Marfa\nPetrovna.'  'That's  just  like  you,  Arkady\nIvanovitch; it does you very little credit to come\nlooking  for  a  bride  when  you've  hardly  buried\nyour wife. And if you could make a good choice,\nat  least,  but  I  know  it  won't  be  for  your\nhappiness  or  hers,  you  will  only  be  a\nlaughing-stock  to  all  good  people.'  Then  she\nwent out and her train seemed to rustle. Isn't it\nnonsense, eh?'\n'But  perhaps  you  are  telling  lies?'  Raskolnikov\nput in.\n'I rarely lie,' answered Svidrigaïlov thoughtfully,\napparently  not  noticing  the  rudeness  of  the\nquestion.\n'And  in  the  past,  have  you  ever  seen  ghosts\nbefore?'\n'Y-yes,  I  have  seen  them,  but  only  once  in  my\nlife, six years ago. I had a serf, Filka; just after\nhis burial I called out forgetting 'Filka, my pipe!'\nHe came in and went to the cupboard where my\npipes were. I sat still and thought 'he is doing it", "out  of  revenge,'  because  we  had  a  violent\nquarrel  just  before  his  death.  'How  dare  you\ncome  in  with  a  hole  in  0(cid:24)  your  elbow?'  I  said.\n'Go away, you scamp!' He turned and went out,\nand  never  came  again.  I  didn't  tell  Marfa\nPetrovna at the time. I wanted to have a service\nsung for him, but I was ashamed.'\n'You should go to a doctor.'\n'I  know  I  am  not  well,  without  your  telling  me,\nthough I don't know what's wrong; I believe I am\nfive times as strong as you are. I didn't ask you\nwhether  you  believe  that  ghosts  are  seen,  but\nwhether you believe that they exist.'\n'No,  I  won't  believe  it!'  Raskolnikov  cried,  with\npositive anger.\n'What  do  people  generally  say?'  muttered\nSvidrigaïlov,  as  though  speaking  to  himself,\nlooking  aside  and  bowing  his  head.  'They  say,\n'You  are  ill,  so  what  appears  to  you  is  only\nunreal  fantasy.'  But  that's  not  strictly  logical.  I\nagree  that  ghosts  only  appear  to  the  sick,  but\nthat only proves that they are unable to appear\nexcept to the sick, not that they don't exist.'", "'Nothing  of  the  sort,'  Raskolnikov  insisted\nirritably.\n'No?  You  don't  think  so?'  Svidrigaïlov  went  on,\nlooking at him deliberately. 'But what do you say\nto  this  argument  (help  me  with  it):  ghosts  are,\nas  it  were,  shreds  and  fragments  of  other\nworlds, the beginning of them. A man in health\nhas, of course, no reason to see them, because\nhe is above all a man of this earth and is bound\nfor  the  sake  of  completeness  and  order  to  live\nonly  in  this  life.  But  as  soon  as  one  is  ill,  as\nsoon  as  the  normal  earthly  order  of  the\norganism  is  broken,  one  begins  to  realise  the\npossibility  of  another  world;  and  the  more\nseriously  ill  one  is,  the  closer  (cid:24)0(cid:24)  Crime  and\nPunishment  becomes  one's  contact  with  that\nother world, so that as soon as the man dies he\nsteps  straight  into  that  world.  I  thought  of  that\nlong  ago.  If  you  believe  in  a  future  life,  you\ncould believe in that, too.'\n'I don't believe in a future life,' said Raskolnikov.\nSvidrigaïlov sat lost in thought.", "'And  what  if  there  are  only  spiders  there,  or\nsomething of that sort,' he said suddenly.\n'He is a madman,' thought Raskolnikov.\n'We  always  imagine  eternity  as  something\nbeyond  our  conception,  something  vast,  vast!\nBut  why  must  it  be  vast?  Instead  of  all  that,\nwhat  if  it's  one  little  room,  like  a  bath  house  in\nthe  country,  black  and  grimy  and  spiders  in\nevery  corner,  and  that's  all  eternity  is?  I\nsometimes fancy it like that.'\n'Can  it  be  you  can  imagine  nothing  juster  and\nmore  comforting  than  that?'  Raskolnikov  cried,\nwith a feeling of anguish.\n'Juster?  And  how  can  we  tell,  perhaps  that  is\njust, and do you know it's what I would certainly\nhave  made  it,'  answered  Svidrigaïlov,  with  a\nvague smile.\nThis  horrible  answer  sent  a  cold  chill  through\nRaskolnikov.  Svidrigaïlov  raised  his  head,\nlooked at him, and suddenly began laughing.\n'Only think,' he cried, 'half an hour ago we had", "never seen each other, we regarded each other\nas enemies; there is a matter unsettled between\nus; we've thrown it aside, and away we've gone\ninto the abstract! Wasn't I right in saying that we\nwere  birds  of  a  feather?'0(cid:24)  'Kindly  allow  me,'\nRaskolnikov  went  on  irritably,  'to  ask  you  to\nexplain  why  you  have  honoured  me  with  your\nvisit  ...  and  ...  and  I  am  in  a  hurry,  I  have  no\ntime to waste. I want to go out.'\n'By  all  means,  by  all  means.  Your  sister,\nAvdotya Romanovna, is going to be married to\nMr. Luzhin, Pyotr Petrovitch?'\n'Can  you  refrain  from  any  question  about  my\nsister  and  from  mentioning  her  name?  I  can't\nunderstand how you dare utter her name in my\npresence, if you really are Svidrigaïlov.'\n'Why,  but  I've  come  here  to  speak  about  her;\nhow can I avoid mentioning her?'\n'Very good, speak, but make haste.'\n'I am sure that you must have formed your own\nopinion of this Mr. Luzhin, who is a connection\nof mine through my wife, if you have only seen", "him  for  half  an  hour,  or  heard  any  facts  about\nhim. He is no match for Avdotya Romanovna. I\nbelieve  Avdotya  Romanovna  is  sacrificing\nherself generously and imprudently for the sake\nof ... for the sake of her family. I fancied from all\nI had heard of you that you would be very glad if\nthe  match  could  be  broken  off  without  the\nsacrifice of worldly advantages. Now I know you\npersonally, I am convinced of it.'\n'All  this  is  very  naïve  ...  excuse  me,  I  should\nhave  said  impudent  on  your  part,'  said\nRaskolnikov.\n'You  mean  to  say  that  I  am  seeking  my  own\nends. Don't be uneasy, Rodion Romanovitch, if\nI  were  working  for  my  own  advantage,  I  would\nnot have spoken out so directly. I (cid:24)10 Crime and\nPunishment  am  not  quite  a  fool.  I  will  confess\nsomething  psychologically  curious  about  that:\njust  now,  defending  my  love  for  Avdotya\nRomanovna,  I  said  I  was  myself  the  victim.\nWell, let me tell you that I've no feeling of love\nnow,  not  the  slightest,  so  that  I  wonder  myself\nindeed, for I really did feel something ...'\n'Through  idleness  and  depravity,'  Raskolnikov", "put in.\n'I certainly am idle and depraved, but your sister\nhas  such  qualities  that  even  I  could  not  help\nbeing  impressed  by  them.  But  that's  all\nnonsense, as I see myself now.'\n'Have you seen that long?'\n'I began to be aware of it before, but was only\nperfectly  sure  of  it  the  day  before  yesterday,\nalmost at the moment I arrived in Petersburg. I\nstill  fancied  in  Moscow,  though,  that  I  was\ncoming to try to get Avdotya Romanovna's hand\nand to cut out Mr. Luzhin.'\n'Excuse me for interrupting you; kindly be brief,\nand  come  to  the  object  of  your  visit.  I  am  in  a\nhurry, I want to go out ...'\n'With  the  greatest  pleasure.  On  arriving  here\nand  determining  on  a  certain  ...  journey,  I\nshould like to make some necessary preliminary\narrangements.  I  left  my  children  with  an  aunt;\nthey  are  well  provided  for;  and  they  have  no\nneed  of  me  personally.  And  a  nice  father  I\nshould make, too! I have taken nothing but what", "Marfa  Petrovna  gave  me  a  year  ago.  That's\nenough for me. Excuse me, I am just coming to\nthe  point.  Before  the  journey  which  may  come\noff, I want to settle Mr. Luzhin, too. It's not that I\ndetest  him  so  much,  but  it  was  through  him  I\nquarrelled  with  Marfa  Petrovna  when  I  learned\nthat she had dished up this mar-11 riage. I want\nnow  to  see  Avdotya  Romanovna  through  your\nmediation,  and  if  you  like  in  your  presence,  to\nexplain  to  her  that  in  the  first  place  she  will\nnever  gain  anything  but  harm  from  Mr.  Luzhin.\nThen,  begging  her  pardon  for  all  past\nunpleasantness,  to  make  her  a  present  of  ten\nthousand roubles and so assist the rupture with\nMr.  Luzhin,  a  rupture  to  which  I  believe  she  is\nherself not disinclined, if she could see the way\nto it.'\n'You  are  certainly  mad,'  cried  Raskolnikov  not\nso much angered as astonished. 'How dare you\ntalk like that!'\n'I knew you would scream at me; but in the first\nplace,  though  I  am  not  rich,  this  ten  thousand\nroubles  is  perfectly  free;  I  have  absolutely  no\nneed  for  it.  If  Avdotya  Romanovna  does  not\naccept  it,  I  shall  waste  it  in  some  more  foolish", "way.  That's  the  first  thing.  Secondly,  my\nconscience  is  perfectly  easy;  I  make  the  offer\nwith no ulterior motive. You may not believe it,\nbut in the end Avdotya Romanovna and you will\nknow. The point is, that I did actually cause your\nsister, whom I greatly respect, some trouble and\nunpleasantness, and so, sincerely regretting it, I\nwant-not  to  compensate,  not  to  repay  her  for\nthe unpleasantness, but simply to do something\nto  her  advantage,  to  show  that  I  am  not,  after\nall,  privileged  to  do  nothing  but  harm.  If  there\nwere  a  millionth  fraction  of  self-interest  in  my\noffer, I should not have made it so openly; and I\nshould not have offered her ten thousand only,\nwhen  five  weeks  ago  I  offered  her  more,\nBesides,  I  may,  perhaps,  very  soon  marry  a\nyoung  lady,  and  that  alone  ought  to  prevent\nsuspicion  of  any  design  on  Avdotya\nRomanovna.  In  conclusion,  let  me  say  that  in\nmarrying Mr. (cid:24)1(cid:24) Crime and Punishment Luzhin,\nshe  is  taking  money  just  the  same,  only  from\nanother  man.  Don't  be  angry,  Rodion\nRomanovitch, think it over coolly and quietly.'\nSvidrigaïlov  himself  was  exceedingly  cool  and\nquiet as he was saying this.", "'I beg you to say no more,' said Raskolnikov. 'In\nany case this is unpardonable impertinence.'\n'Not  in  the  least.  Then  a  man  may  do  nothing\nbut  harm  to  his  neighbour  in  this  world,  and  is\nprevented  from  doing  the  tiniest  bit  of  good  by\ntrivial conventional formalities. That's absurd. If I\ndied,  for  instance,  and  left  that  sum  to  your\nsister in my will, surely she wouldn't refuse it?'\n'Very likely she would.'\n'Oh, no, indeed. However, if you refuse it, so be\nit, though ten thousand roubles is a capital thing\nto  have  on  occasion.  In  any  case  I  beg  you  to\nrepeat  what  I  have  said  to  Avdotya\nRomanovna.'\n'No, I won't.'\n'In  that  case,  Rodion  Romanovitch,  I  shall  be\nobliged to try and see her myself and worry her\nby doing so.'\n'And if I do tell her, will you not try to see her?'\n'I  don't  know  really  what  to  say.  I  should  like", "very much to see her once more.'\n'Don't hope for it.'\n'I'm sorry. But you don't know me. Perhaps we\nmay become better friends.'\n'You think we may become friends?'\n'And  why  not?'  Svidrigaïlov  said,  smiling.  He\nstood up and took his hat. 'I didn't quite intend\nto  disturb  you  and  1(cid:24)  I  came  here  without\nreckoning  on  it  ...  though  I  was  very  much\nstruck by your face this morning.'\n'Where  did  you  see  me  this  morning?'\nRaskolnikov asked uneasily.\n'I saw you by chance.... I kept fancying there is\nsomething  about  you  like  me....  But  don't  be\nuneasy. I am not intrusive; I used to get on all\nright  with  card-sharpers,  and  I  never  bored\nPrince  Svirbey,  a  great  personage  who  is  a\ndistant relation of mine, and I could write about\nRaphael's  Madonna  in  Madam  Prilukov's\nalbum, and I never left Marfa Petrovna's side for\nseven  years,  and  I  used  to  stay  the  night  at", "Viazemsky's house in the Hay Market in the old\ndays,  and  I  may  go  up  in  a  balloon  with  Berg,\nperhaps.'\n'Oh,  all  right.  Are  you  starting  soon  on  your\ntravels, may I ask?'\n'What travels?'\n'Why, on that 'journey'; you spoke of it yourself.'\n'A  journey?  Oh,  yes.  I  did  speak  of  a  journey.\nWell,  that's  a  wide  subject....  if  only  you  knew\nwhat  you  are  asking,'  he  added,  and  gave  a\nsudden,  loud,  short  laugh.  'Perhaps  I'll  get\nmarried  instead  of  the  journey.  They're  making\na match for me.''Here?''Yes.'\n'How have you had time for that?'\n'But  I  am  very  anxious  to  see  Avdotya\nRomanovna  once.  I  earnestly  beg  it.  Well,\ngood-bye  for  the  present.  Oh,  yes.  I  have\nforgotten  something.  Tell  your  sister,  Rodion\nRomanovitch, that Marfa Petrovna remembered\nher in her will (cid:24)1(cid:24) Crime and Punishment and left\nher  three  thousand  roubles.  That's  absolutely", "certain.  Marfa  Petrovna  arranged  it  a  week\nbefore  her  death,  and  it  was  done  in  my\npresence.  Avdotya  Romanovna  will  be  able  to\nreceive the money in two or three weeks.'\n'Are you telling the truth?'\n'Yes,  tell  her.  Well,  your  servant.  I  am  staying\nvery near you.'\nAs  he  went  out,  Svidrigaïlov  ran  up  against\nRazumihin in the doorway.1(cid:24) ", "#$#$Chapter 25#$#$\nt was nearly eight o'clock. The two young men\nhurried to \nBakaleyev's, to arrive before Luzhin.\n'Why,  who  was  that?'  asked  Razumihin,  as\nsoon as they were in the street.\n'It  was  Svidrigaïlov,  that  landowner  in  whose\nhouse  my  sister  was  insulted  when  she  was\ntheir  governess.  Through  his  persecuting  her\nwith  his  attentions,  she  was  turned  out  by  his\nwife,  Marfa  Petrovna.  This  Marfa  Petrovna\nbegged  Dounia's  forgiveness  afterwards,  and\nshe's just died suddenly. It was of her we were\ntalking this morning. I don't know why I'm afraid\nof  that  man.  He  came  here  at  once  after  his\nwife's  funeral.  He  is  very  strange,  and  is\ndetermined  on  doing  something....  We  must\nguard Dounia from him ... that's what I wanted\nto tell you, do you hear?'\n'Guard  her!  What  can  he  do  to  harm  Avdotya", "Romanovna?  Thank  you,  Rodya,  for  speaking\nto  me  like  that....  We  will,  we  will  guard  her.\nWhere does he live?'\n'I don't know.'\n'Why  didn't  you  ask?  What  a  pity!  I'll  find  out,\nthough.'\n'Did  you  see  him?'  asked  Raskolnikov  after  a\npause.\n'Yes, I noticed him, I noticed him well.'\n'You did really see him? You saw him clearly?'\nRaskolnikov insisted.\n'Yes,  I  remember  him  perfectly,  I  should  know\nhim in a (cid:24)1(cid:24) Crime and Punishment thousand; I\nhave a good memory for faces.'\nThey were silent again.\n'Hm!  ...  that's  all  right,'  muttered  Raskolnikov.\n'Do you know, I fancied ... I keep thinking that it\nmay have been an hallucination.'", "'What do you mean? I don't understand you.'\n'Well, you all say,' Raskolnikov went on, twisting\nhis mouth into a smile, 'that I am mad. I thought\njust now that perhaps I really am mad, and have\nonly seen a phantom.'\n'What do you mean?'\n'Why,  who  can  tell?  Perhaps  I  am  really  mad,\nand perhaps everything that happened all these\ndays may be only imagination.'\n'Ach, Rodya, you have been upset again! ... But\nwhat did he say, what did he come for?'\nRaskolnikov did not answer. Razumihin thought\na minute.\n'Now  let  me  tell  you  my  story,'  he  began,  'I\ncame  to  you,  you  were  asleep.  Then  we  had\ndinner  and  then  I  went  to  Porfiry's,  Zametov\nwas still with him. I tried to begin, but it was no\nuse. I couldn't speak in the right way. They don't\nseem  to  understand  and  can't  understand,  but\nare  not  a  bit  ashamed.  I  drew  Porfiry  to  the\nwindow, and began talking to him, but it was still", "no use. He looked away and I looked away. At\nlast I shook my fist in his ugly face, and told him\nas  a  cousin  I'd  brain  him.  He  merely  looked  at\nme,  I  cursed  and  came  away.  That  was  all.  It\nwas  very  stupid.  To  Zametov  I  didn't  say  a\nword. But, you see, I thought I'd made a mess\nof  it,  but  as  I  went  downstairs  a  brilliant  idea\nstruck me: why 1(cid:24) should we trouble? Of course\nif you were in any danger or anything, but why\nneed  you  care?  You  needn't  care  a  hang  for\nthem.  We  shall  have  a  laugh  at  them\nafterwards, and if I were in your place I'd mystify\nthem  more  than  ever.  How  ashamed  they'll  be\nafterwards!  Hang  them!  We  can  thrash  them\nafterwards, but let's laugh at them now!'\n'To  be  sure,'  answered  Raskolnikov.  'But  what\nwill  you  say  to-morrow?'  he  thought  to  himself.\nStrange  to  say,  till  that  moment  it  had  never\noccurred  to  him  to  wonder  what  Razumihin\nwould  think  when  he  knew.  As  he  thought  it,\nRaskolnikov  looked  at  him.  Razumihin's\naccount  of  his  visit  to  Porfiry  had  very  little\ninterest  for  him,  so  much  had  come  and  gone\nsince then.\nIn the corridor they came upon Luzhin; he had", "arrived punctually at eight, and was looking for\nthe  number,  so  that  all  three  went  in  together\nwithout greeting or looking at one another. The\nyoung  men  walked  in  first,  while  Pyotr\nPetrovitch, for good manners, lingered a little in\nthe  passage,  taking  off  his  coat.  Pulcheria\nAlexandrovna  came  forward  at  once  to  greet\nhim in the doorway, Dounia was welcoming her\nbrother.  Pyotr  Petrovitch  walked  in  and  quite\namiably,  though  with  redoubled  dignity,  bowed\nto the ladies. He looked, however, as though he\nwere  a  little  put  out  and  could  not  yet  recover\nhimself.  Pulcheria  Alexandrovna,  who  seemed\nalso  a  little  embarrassed,  hastened  to  make\nthem  all  sit  down  at  the  round  table  where  a\nsamovar  was  boiling.  Dounia  and  Luzhin  were\nfacing  one  another  on  opposite  sides  of  the\ntable.  Razumihin  and  Raskolnikov  were  facing\nPulcheria  Alexandrovna,  Razumihin  was  next\n(cid:24)1(cid:24)  Crime  and  Punishment  to  Luzhin  and\nRaskolnikov was beside his sister.\nA  moment's  silence  followed.  Pyotr  Petrovitch\ndeliberately  drew  out  a  cambric  handkerchief\nreeking of scent and blew his nose with an air of\na benevolent man who felt himself slighted, and\nwas firmly resolved to insist on an explanation.", "In the passage the idea had occurred to him to\nkeep  on  his  overcoat  and  walk  away,  and  so\ngive the two ladies a sharp and emphatic lesson\nand make them feel the gravity of the position.\nBut  he  could  not  bring  himself  to  do  this.\nBesides,  he  could  not  endure  uncertainty,  and\nhe  wanted  an  explanation:  if  his  request  had\nbeen  so  openly  disobeyed,  there  was\nsomething  behind  it,  and  in  that  case  it  was\nbetter  to  find  it  out  beforehand;  it  rested  with\nhim to punish them and there would always be\ntime for that.\n'I  trust  you  had  a  favourable  journey,'  he\ninquired officially of Pulcheria Alexandrovna.\n'Oh, very, Pyotr Petrovitch.'\n'I  am  gratified  to  hear  it.  And  Avdotya\nRomanovna is not over-fatigued either?'\n'I  am  young  and  strong,  I  don't  get  tired,  but  it\nwas  a  great  strain  for  mother,'  answered\nDounia.\n'That's unavoidable! our national railways are of\nterrible length. 'Mother Russia,' as they say, is a", "vast country.... In spite of all my desire to do so,\nI was unable to meet you yesterday. But I trust\nall passed off without inconvenience?'\n'Oh,  no,  Pyotr  Petrovitch,  it  was  all  terribly\ndisheartening,'  Pulcheria  Alexandrovna\nhastened  to  declare  with  peculiar  intonation,\n'and if Dmitri Prokofitch had not been sent us, I\nreally  believe  by  God  Himself,  we  should  have\n1(cid:24)  been  utterly  lost.  Here,  he  is!  Dmitri\nProkofitch  Razumihin,'  she  added,  introducing\nhim to Luzhin.\n'I had the pleasure ... yesterday,' muttered Pyotr\nPetrovitch  with  a  hostile  glance  sidelong  at\nRazumihin; then he scowled and was silent.\nPyotr  Petrovitch  belonged  to  that  class  of\npersons,  on  the  surface  very  polite  in  society,\nwho make a great point of punctiliousness, but\nwho,  directly  they  are  crossed  in  anything,  are\ncompletely disconcerted, and become more like\nsacks  of  flour  than  elegant  and  lively  men  of\nsociety.  Again  all  was  silent;  Raskolnikov  was\nobstinately  mute,  Avdotya  Romanovna  was\nunwilling  to  open  the  conversation  too  soon.\nRazumihin  had  nothing  to  say,  so  Pulcheria", "Alexandrovna was anxious again.\n'Marfa Petrovna is dead, have you heard?' she\nbegan  having  recourse  to  her  leading  item  of\nconversation.\n'To  be  sure,  I  heard  so.  I  was  immediately\ninformed,  and  I  have  come  to  make  you\nacquainted with the fact that Arkady Ivanovitch\nSvidrigaïlov  set  off  in  haste  for  Petersburg\nimmediately after his wife's funeral. So at least I\nhave excellent authority for believing.'\n'To  Petersburg?  here?'  Dounia  asked  in  alarm\nand looked at her mother.\n'Yes,  indeed,  and  doubtless  not  without  some\ndesign,  having  in  view  the  rapidity  of  his\ndeparture, and all the circumstances preceding\nit.'\n'Good heavens! won't he leave Dounia in peace\neven here?' cried Pulcheria Alexandrovna.\n'I  imagine  that  neither  you  nor  Avdotya\nRomanovna  (cid:24)(cid:24)0  Crime  and  Punishment  have\nany grounds for uneasiness, unless, of course,", "you  are  yourselves  desirous  of  getting  into\ncommunication  with  him.  For  my  part  I  am  on\nmy guard, and am now discovering where he is\nlodging.'\n'Oh,  Pyotr  Petrovitch,  you  would  not  believe\nwhat  a  fright  you  have  given  me,'  Pulcheria\nAlexandrovna  went  on:  'I've  only  seen  him\ntwice,  but  I  thought  him  terrible,  terrible!  I  am\nconvinced  that  he  was  the  cause  of  Marfa\nPetrovna's death.'\n'It's  impossible  to  be  certain  about  that.  I  have\nprecise  information.  I  do  not  dispute  that  he\nmay  have  contributed  to  accelerate  the  course\nof  events  by  the  moral  influence,  so  to  say,  of\nthe  affront;  but  as  to  the  general  conduct  and\nmoral characteristics of that personage, I am in\nagreement with you. I do not know whether he\nis  well  off  now,  and  precisely  what  Marfa\nPetrovna  left  him;  this  will  be  known  to  me\nwithin a very short period; but no doubt here in\nPetersburg, if he has any pecuniary resources,\nhe will relapse at once into his old ways. He is\nthe  most  depraved,  and  abjectly  vicious\nspecimen  of  that  class  of  men.  I  have\nconsiderable  reason  to  believe  that  Marfa", "Petrovna,  who  was  so  unfortunate  as  to  fall  in\nlove  with  him  and  to  pay  his  debts  eight  years\nago, was of service to him also in another way.\nSolely  by  her  exertions  and  sacrifices,  a\ncriminal  charge,  involving  an  element  of\nfantastic  and  homicidal  brutality  for  which  he\nmight well have been sentenced to Siberia, was\nhushed up. That's the sort of man he is, if you\ncare to know.'\n'Good  heavens!'  cried  Pulcheria  Alexandrovna.\nRaskolnikov  listened  attentively.(cid:24)1  'Are  you\nspeaking the truth when you say that you have\ngood  evidence  of  this?'  Dounia  asked  sternly\nand emphatically.\n'I only repeat what I was told in secret by Marfa\nPetrovna.  I  must  observe  that  from  the  legal\npoint of view the case was far from clear. There\nwas,  and  I  believe  still  is,  living  here  a  woman\ncalled  Resslich,  a  foreigner,  who  lent  small\nsums  of  money  at  interest,  and  did  other\ncommissions, and with this woman Svidrigaïlov\nhad  for  a  long  while  close  and  mysterious\nrelations. She had a relation, a niece I believe,\nliving with her, a deaf and dumb girl of fifteen, or\nperhaps not more than fourteen. Resslich hated", "this girl, and grudged her every crust; she used\nto  beat  her  mercilessly.  One  day  the  girl  was\nfound  hanging  in  the  garret.  At  the  inquest  the\nverdict was suicide. After the usual proceedings\nthe matter ended, but, later on, information was\ngiven that the child had been ... cruelly outraged\nby  Svidrigaïlov.  It  is  true,  this  was  not  clearly\nestablished,  the  information  was  given  by\nanother  German  woman  of  loose  character\nwhose word could not be trusted; no statement\nwas  actually  made  to  the  police,  thanks  to\nMarfa  Petrovna's  money  and  exertions;  it  did\nnot  get  beyond  gossip.  And  yet  the  story  is  a\nvery  significant  one.  You  heard,  no  doubt,\nAvdotya Romanovna, when you were with them\nthe  story  of  the  servant  Philip  who  died  of  ill\ntreatment he received six years ago, before the\nabolition of serfdom.'\n'I heard, on the contrary, that this Philip hanged\nhimself.'\n'Quite so, but what drove him, or rather perhaps\ndis(cid:24)  posed  him,  to  suicide  was  the  systematic\npersecution and severity of Mr. Svidrigaïlov.'\n'I  don't  know  that,'  answered  Dounia,  dryly.  'I", "only heard a queer story that Philip was a sort\nof  hypochondriac,  a  sort  of  domestic\nphilosopher, the servants used to say, 'he read\nhimself silly,' and that he hanged himself partly\non account of Mr. Svidrigaïlov's mockery of him\nand  not  his  blows.  When  I  was  there  he\nbehaved  well  to  the  servants,  and  they  were\nactually  fond  of  him,  though  they  certainly  did\nblame him for Philip's death.'\n'I perceive, Avdotya Romanovna, that you seem\ndisposed  to  undertake  his  defence  all  of  a\nsudden,'  Luzhin  observed,  twisting  his  lips  into\nan ambiguous smile, 'there's no doubt that he is\nan astute man, and insinuating where ladies are\nconcerned,  of  which  Marfa  Petrovna,  who  has\ndied so strangely, is a terrible instance. My only\ndesire  has  been  to  be  of  service  to  you  and\nyour  mother  with  my  advice,  in  view  of  the\nrenewed  efforts  which  may  certainly  be\nanticipated  from  him.  For  my  part  it's  my  firm\nconviction, that he will end in a debtor's prison\nagain.  Marfa  Petrovna  had  not  the  slightest\nintention of settling anything substantial on him,\nhaving regard for his children's interests, and, if\nshe  left  him  anything,  it  would  only  be  the\nmerest  sufficiency,  something  insignificant  and", "ephemeral,  which  would  not  last  a  year  for  a\nman of his habits.'\n'Pyotr  Petrovitch,  I  beg  you,'  said  Dounia,  'say\nno  more  of  Mr.  Svidrigaïlov.  It  makes  me\nmiserable.'\n'He has just been to see me,' said Raskolnikov,\nbreaking  his  silence  for  the  first  time.(cid:24)(cid:24)  There\nwere exclamations from all, and they all turned\nto him. Even Pyotr Petrovitch was roused.\n'An hour and a half ago, he came in when I was\nasleep,  waked  me,  and  introduced  himself,'\nRaskolnikov  continued.  'He  was  fairly  cheerful\nand  at  ease,  and  quite  hopes  that  we  shall\nbecome  friends.  He  is  particularly  anxious,  by\nthe  way,  Dounia,  for  an  interview  with  you,  at\nwhich  he  asked  me  to  assist.  He  has  a\nproposition  to  make  to  you,  and  he  told  me\nabout it. He told me, too, that a week before her\ndeath  Marfa  Petrovna  left  you  three  thousand\nroubles  in  her  will,  Dounia,  and  that  you  can\nreceive the money very shortly.'\n'Thank  God!'  cried  Pulcheria  Alexandrovna,\ncrossing herself. 'Pray for her soul, Dounia!'", "'It's a fact!' broke from Luzhin.\n'Tell  us,  what  more?'  Dounia  urged\nRaskolnikov.\n'Then  he  said  that  he  wasn't  rich  and  all  the\nestate was left to his children who are now with\nan  aunt,  then  that  he  was  staying  somewhere\nnot far from me, but where, I don't know, I didn't\nask....'\n'But  what,  what  does  he  want  to  propose  to\nDounia?'  cried  Pulcheria  Alexandrovna  in  a\nfright. 'Did he tell you?''Yes.'\n'What was it?'\n'I'll tell you afterwards.'\nRaskolnikov  ceased  speaking  and  turned  his\nattention to his tea.\nPyotr Petrovitch looked at his watch.\n'I  am  compelled  to  keep  a  business\nengagement, and so I shall not be in your way,'", "he  added  with  an  air  of  some  pique  (cid:24)  and  he\nbegan getting up.\n'Don't  go,  Pyotr  Petrovitch,'  said  Dounia,  'you\nintended  to  spend  the  evening.  Besides,  you\nwrote  yourself  that  you  wanted  to  have  an\nexplanation with mother.'\n'Precisely  so,  Avdotya  Romanovna,'  Pyotr\nPetrovitch  answered  impressively,  sitting  down\nagain,  but  still  holding  his  hat.  'I  certainly\ndesired  an  explanation  with  you  and  your\nhonoured  mother  upon  a  very  important  point\nindeed.  But  as  your  brother  cannot  speak\nopenly in my presence of some proposals of Mr.\nSvidrigaïlov,  I,  too,  do  not  desire  and  am  not\nable  to  speak  openly  ...  in  the  presence  of\nothers  ...  of  certain  matters  of  the  greatest\ngravity. Moreover, my most weighty and urgent\nrequest has been disregarded....'\nAssuming  an  aggrieved  air,  Luzhin  relapsed\ninto dignified silence.\n'Your  request  that  my  brother  should  not  be\npresent  at  our  meeting  was  disregarded  solely\nat  my  instance,'  said  Dounia.  'You  wrote  that", "you  had  been  insulted  by  my  brother;  I  think\nthat  this  must  be  explained  at  once,  and  you\nmust  be  reconciled.  And  if  Rodya  really  has\ninsulted you, then he should and will apologise.'\nPyotr Petrovitch took a stronger line.\n'There  are  insults,  Avdotya  Romanovna,  which\nno goodwill can make us forget. There is a line\nin everything which it is dangerous to overstep;\nand when it has been overstepped, there is no\nreturn.'\n'That  wasn't  what  I  was  speaking  of  exactly,\nPyotr Petrovitch,' Dounia interrupted with some\nimpatience.  'Please  understand  that  our  whole\nfuture  depends  now  on  wheth-(cid:24)(cid:24)  er  all  this  is\nexplained  and  set  right  as  soon  as  possible.  I\ntell you frankly at the start that I cannot look at it\nin  any  other  light,  and  if  you  have  the  least\nregard for me, all this business must be ended\nto-day, however hard that may be. I repeat that\nif  my  brother  is  to  blame  he  will  ask  your\nforgiveness.'\n'I am surprised at your putting the question like\nthat,'  said  Luzhin,  getting  more  and  more", "irritated.  'Esteeming,  and  so  to  say,  adoring\nyou, I may at the same time, very well indeed,\nbe able to dislike some member of your family.\nThough  I  lay  claim  to  the  happiness  of  your\nhand,  I  cannot  accept  duties  incompatible  with\n...'\n'Ah,  don't  be  so  ready  to  take  offence,  Pyotr\nPetrovitch,' Dounia interrupted with feeling, 'and\nbe  the  sensible  and  generous  man  I  have\nalways considered, and wish to consider, you to\nbe.  I've  given  you  a  great  promise,  I  am  your\nbetrothed.  Trust  me  in  this  matter  and,  believe\nme, I shall be capable of judging impartially. My\nassuming  the  part  of  judge  is  as  much  a\nsurprise  for  my  brother  as  for  you.  When  I\ninsisted  on  his  coming  to  our  interview  to-day\nafter  your  letter,  I  told  him  nothing  of  what  I\nmeant  to  do.  Understand  that,  if  you  are  not\nreconciled,  I  must  choose  between  you-it  must\nbe  either  you  or  he.  That  is  how  the  question\nrests on your side and on his. I don't want to be\nmistaken  in  my  choice,  and  I  must  not  be.  For\nyour sake I must break off with my brother, for\nmy  brother's  sake  I  must  break  off  with  you.  I\ncan  find  out  for  certain  now  whether  he  is  a\nbrother to me, and I want to know it; and of you,", "whether I am dear to you, whether you esteem\nme, whether you are the hus(cid:24) band for me.'\n'Avdotya    Romanovna,'    Luzhin    declared \nhuffily,    'your  words  are  of  too  much\nconsequence  to  me;  I  will  say  more,  they  are\noffensive  in  view  of  the  position  I  have  the\nhonour  to  occupy  in  relation  to  you.  To  say\nnothing  of  your  strange  and  offensive  setting\nme  on  a  level  with  an  impertinent  boy,  you\nadmit the possibility of breaking your promise to\nme.  You  say  'you  or  he,'  showing  thereby  of\nhow  little  consequence  I  am  in  your  eyes  ...  I\ncannot let this pass considering the relationship\nand ... the obligations existing between us.'\n'What!' cried Dounia, flushing. 'I set your interest\nbeside all that has hitherto been most precious\nin  my  life,  what  has  made  up  the  whole  of  my\nlife,  and  here  you  are  offended  at  my  making\ntoo little account of you.'\nRaskolnikov  smiled  sarcastically,  Razumihin\nfidgeted, but Pyotr Petrovitch did not accept the\nreproof;  on  the  contrary,  at  every  word  he\nbecame more persistent and irritable, as though\nhe relished it.", "'Love for the future partner of your life, for your\nhusband,  ought  to  outweigh  your  love  for  your\nbrother,'  he  pronounced  sententiously,  'and  in\nany  case  I  cannot  be  put  on  the  same  level....\nAlthough I said so emphatically that I would not\nspeak  openly  in  your  brother's  presence,\nnevertheless, I intend now to ask your honoured\nmother  for  a  necessary  explanation  on  a  point\nof great importance closely affecting my dignity.\nYour son,' he turned to Pulcheria Alexandrovna,\n'yesterday in the presence of Mr. Razsudkin (or\n...  I  think  that's  it?  excuse  me  I  have  forgotten\nyour  (cid:24)(cid:24)  surname,'  he  bowed  politely  to\nRazumihin) 'insulted me by misrepresenting the\nidea  I  expressed  to  you  in  a  private\nconversation,  drinking  coffee,  that  is,  that\nmarriage  with  a  poor  girl  who  has  had\nexperience  of  trouble  is  more  advantageous\nfrom  the  conjugal  point  of  view  than  with  one\nwho  has  lived  in  luxury,  since  it  is  more\nprofitable  for  the  moral  character.  Your  son\nintentionally exaggerated the significance of my\nwords  and  made  them  ridiculous,  accusing  me\nof  malicious  intentions,  and,  as  far  as  I  could\nsee, relied upon your correspondence with him.\nI  shall  consider  myself  happy,  Pulcheria", "Alexandrovna,  if  it  is  possible  for  you  to\nconvince  me  of  an  opposite  conclusion,  and\nthereby  considerately  reassure  me.  Kindly  let\nme know in what terms precisely you repeated\nmy words in your letter to Rodion Romanovitch.'\n'I  don't  remember,'  faltered  Pulcheria\nAlexandrovna. 'I repeated them as I understood\nthem. I don't know how Rodya repeated them to\nyou, perhaps he exaggerated.'\n'He could not have exaggerated them, except at\nyour  instigation.''Pyotr    Petrovitch,'    Pulcheria \nAlexandrovna    declared  with  dignity,  'the  proof\nthat Dounia and I did not take your words in a\nvery bad sense is the fact that we are here.'\n'Good, mother,' said Dounia approvingly.\n'Then  this  is  my  fault  again,'  said  Luzhin,\naggrieved.\n'Well,  Pyotr  Petrovitch,  you  keep  blaming\nRodion, but you yourself have just written what\nwas  false  about  him,'  Pulcheria  Alexandrovna\nadded, gaining courage.", "'I  don't  remember  writing  anything  false.'(cid:24)  'You\nwrote,'  Raskolnikov  said  sharply,  not  turning  to\nLuzhin, 'that I gave money yesterday not to the\nwidow  of  the  man  who  was  killed,  as  was  the\nfact,  but  to  his  daughter  (whom  I  had  never\nseen  till  yesterday).  You  wrote  this  to  make\ndissension between me and my family, and for\nthat object added coarse expressions about the\nconduct of a girl whom you don't know. All that\nis mean slander.'\n'Excuse  me,  sir,'  said  Luzhin,  quivering  with\nfury. 'I enlarged upon your qualities and conduct\nin  my  letter  solely  in  response  to  your  sister's\nand  mother's  inquiries,  how  I  found  you,  and\nwhat impression you made on me. As for what\nyou've alluded to in my letter, be so good as to\npoint  out  one  word  of  falsehood,  show,  that  is,\nthat you didn't throw away your money, and that\nthere  are  not  worthless  persons  in  that  family,\nhowever unfortunate.'\n'To  my  thinking,  you,  with  all  your  virtues,  are\nnot worth the little finger of that unfortunate girl\nat whom you throw stones.'\n'Would you go so far then as to let her associate", "with your mother and sister?'\n'I  have  done  so  already,  if  you  care  to  know.  I\nmade  her  sit  down  to-day  with  mother  and\nDounia.'\n'Rodya!'  cried  Pulcheria  Alexandrovna.  Dounia\ncrimsoned, Razumihin knitted his brows. Luzhin\nsmiled with lofty sarcasm.\n'You  may  see  for  yourself,  Avdotya\nRomanovna,' he said, 'whether it is possible for\nus to agree. I hope now that this question is at\nan  end,  once  and  for  all.  I  will  withdraw,  that  I\nmay not hinder the pleasures of family intimacy,\nand the (cid:24)(cid:24) discussion of secrets.' He got up from\nhis chair and took his hat. 'But in withdrawing, I\nventure  to  request  that  for  the  future  I  may  be\nspared  similar  meetings,  and,  so  to  say,\ncompromises.  I  appeal  particularly  to  you,\nhonoured  Pulcheria  Alexandrovna,  on  this\nsubject, the more as my letter was addressed to\nyou and to no one else.'\nPulcheria Alexandrovna was a little offended.\n'You  seem  to  think  we  are  completely  under", "your authority, Pyotr Petrovitch. Dounia has told\nyou  the  reason  your  desire  was  disregarded,\nshe  had  the  best  intentions.  And  indeed  you\nwrite  as  though  you  were  laying  commands\nupon  me.  Are  we  to  consider  every  desire  of\nyours  as  a  command?  Let  me  tell  you  on  the\ncontrary  that  you  ought  to  show  particular\ndelicacy and consideration for us now, because\nwe have thrown up everything, and have come\nhere relying on you, and so we are in any case\nin a sense in your hands.'\n'That is not quite true, Pulcheria Alexandrovna,\nespecially  at  the  present  moment,  when  the\nnews  has  come  of  Marfa  Petrovna's  legacy,\nwhich seems indeed very apropos, judging from\nthe  new  tone  you  take  to  me,'  he  added\nsarcastically.\n'Judging  from  that  remark,  we  may  certainly\npresume  that  you  were  reckoning  on  our\nhelplessness,' Dounia observed irritably.\n'But now in any case I cannot reckon on it, and I\nparticularly desire not to hinder your discussion\nof  the  secret  proposals  of  Arkady  Ivanovitch\nSvidrigaïlov,  which  he  has  entrusted  to  your", "brother and which have, I perceive, a great and\npossibly  a  very  agreeable  interest  for  you.'(cid:24)(cid:24)0\nCrime  and  Punishment  'Good  heavens!'  cried\nPulcheria Alexandrovna.\nRazumihin could not sit still on his chair.\n'Aren't  you  ashamed  now,  sister?'  asked\nRaskolnikov.\n'I  am  ashamed,  Rodya,'  said  Dounia.  'Pyotr\nPetrovitch,  go  away,'  she  turned  to  him,  white\nwith anger.\nPyotr  Petrovitch  had  apparently  not  at  all\nexpected  such  a  conclusion.  He  had  too  much\nconfidence  in  himself,  in  his  power  and  in  the\nhelplessness  of  his  victims.  He  could  not\nbelieve it even now. He turned pale, and his lips\nquivered.\n'Avdotya  Romanovna,  if  I  go  out  of  this  door\nnow,  after  such  a  dismissal,  then,  you  may\nreckon  on  it,  I  will  never  come  back.  Consider\nwhat  you  are  doing.  My  word  is  not  to  be\nshaken.'", "'What  insolence!'  cried  Dounia,  springing  up\nfrom  her  seat.  'I  don't  want  you  to  come  back\nagain.'\n'What!  So  that's  how  it  stands!'  cried  Luzhin,\nutterly  unable  to  the  last  moment  to  believe  in\nthe rupture and so completely thrown out of his\nreckoning now. 'So that's how it stands! But do\nyou  know,  Avdotya  Romanovna,  that  I  might\nprotest?'\n'What right have you to speak to her like that?'\nPulcheria  Alexandrovna  intervened  hotly.  'And\nwhat  can  you  protest  about?  What  rights  have\nyou? Am I to give my Dounia to a man like you?\nGo away, leave us altogether! We are to blame\nfor  having  agreed  to  a  wrong  action,  and  I\nabove all....'\n'But  you  have  bound  me,  Pulcheria\nAlexandrovna,'  Luzhin  stormed  in  a  frenzy,  'by\nyour  promise,  and  now  you  deny  it  and  ...\nbesides  ...  I  have  been  led  on  account  of  that\ninto  expenses....'(cid:24)1  This  last  complaint  was  so\ncharacteristic  of  Pyotr  Petrovitch,  that\nRaskolnikov, pale with anger and with the effort\nof  restraining  it,  could  not  help  breaking  into", "laughter.  But  Pulcheria  Alexandrovna  was\nfurious.\n'Expenses? What expenses? Are you speaking\nof  our  trunk?  But  the  conductor  brought  it  for\nnothing  for  you.  Mercy  on  us,  we  have  bound\nyou!  What  are  you  thinking  about,  Pyotr\nPetrovitch, it was you bound us, hand and foot,\nnot we!'\n'Enough,  mother,  no  more  please,'  Avdotya\nRomanovna  implored.  'Pyotr  Petrovitch,  do  be\nkind and go!'\n'I  am  going,  but  one  last  word,'  he  said,  quite\nunable to control himself. 'Your mamma seems\nto  have  entirely  forgotten  that  I  made  up  my\nmind to take you, so to speak, after the gossip\nof  the  town  had  spread  all  over  the  district  in\nregard  to  your  reputation.  Disregarding  public\nopinion  for  your  sake  and  reinstating  your\nreputation, I certainly might very well reckon on\na  fitting  return,  and  might  indeed  look  for\ngratitude on your part. And my eyes have only\nnow been opened! I see myself that I may have\nacted  very,  very  recklessly  in  disregarding  the\nuniversal verdict....'", "'Does the fellow want his head smashed?' cried\nRazumihin, jumping up.\n'You  are  a  mean  and  spiteful  man!'  cried\nDounia.\n'Not  a  word!  Not  a  movement!'  cried\nRaskolnikov,  holding  Razumihin  back;  then\ngoing  close  up  to  Luzhin,  'Kindly  leave  the\nroom!' he said quietly and distinctly, 'and not a\nword more or ...'\nPyotr Petrovitch gazed at him for some seconds\nwith a (cid:24) pale face that worked with anger, then\nhe  turned,  went  out,  and  rarely  has  any  man\ncarried away in his heart such vindictive hatred\nas  he  felt  against  Raskolnikov.  Him,  and  him\nalone, he blamed for everything. It is noteworthy\nthat as he went downstairs he still imagined that\nhis case was perhaps not utterly lost, and that,\nso  far  as  the  ladies  were  concerned,  all  might\n'very well indeed' be set right again.(cid:24)(cid:24) ", "#$#$Chapter 26#$#$\nThe fact was that up to the last moment he had\nnever  expected  such  an  ending;  he  had  been\noverbearing to the last degree, never dreaming\nthat two destitute and defenceless women could\nescape  from  his  control.  This  conviction  was\nstrengthened  by  his  vanity  and  conceit,  a\nconceit  to  the  point  of  fatuity.  Pyotr  Petrovitch,\nwho  had  made  his  way  up  from  insignificance,\nwas  morbidly  given  to  self-admiration,  had  the\nhighest  opinion  of  his  intelligence  and\ncapacities,  and  sometimes  even  gloated  in\nsolitude  over  his  image  in  the  glass.  But  what\nhe  loved  and  valued  above  all  was  the  money\nhe had amassed by his labour, and by all sorts\nof  devices:  that  money  made  him  the  equal  of\nall who had been his superiors.\nWhen  he  had  bitterly  reminded  Dounia  that  he\nhad  decided  to  take  her  in  spite  of  evil  report,\nPyotr  Petrovitch  had  spoken  with  perfect\nsincerity  and  had,  indeed,  felt  genuinely\nindignant  at  such  'black  ingratitude.'  And  yet,\nwhen  he  made  Dounia  his  offer,  he  was  fully", "aware  of  the  groundlessness  of  all  the  gossip.\nThe story had been everywhere contradicted by\nMarfa Petrovna, and was by then disbelieved by\nall  the  townspeople,  who  were  warm  in\nDounia'a  defence.  And  he  would  not  have\ndenied that he knew all that at the time. Yet he\nstill thought highly of his own resolution in lifting\nDounia  to  his  level  and  regarded  it  as\nsomething (cid:24) heroic. In speaking of it to Dounia,\nhe  had  let  out  the  secret  feeling  he  cherished\nand admired, and he could not understand that\nothers should fail to admire it too. He had called\non Raskolnikov with the feelings of a benefactor\nwho is about to reap the fruits of his good deeds\nand to hear agreeable flattery. And as he went\ndownstairs  now,  he  considered  himself  most\nundeservedly injured and unrecognised.\nDounia  was  simply  essential  to  him;  to  do\nwithout her was unthinkable. For many years he\nhad had voluptuous dreams of marriage, but he\nhad gone on waiting and amassing money. He\nbrooded with relish, in profound secret, over the\nimage  of  a  girl-virtuous,  poor  (she  must  be\npoor), very young, very pretty, of good birth and\neducation,  very  timid,  one  who  had  suffered\nmuch, and was completely humbled before him,", "one  who  would  all  her  life  look  on  him  as  her\nsaviour, worship him, admire him and only him.\nHow  many  scenes,  how  many  amorous\nepisodes  he  had  imagined  on  this  seductive\nand  playful  theme,  when  his  work  was  over!\nAnd,  behold,  the  dream  of  so  many  years  was\nall  but  realised;  the  beauty  and  education  of\nAvdotya  Romanovna  had  impressed  him;  her\nhelpless  position  had  been  a  great  allurement;\nin  her  he  had  found  even  more  than  he\ndreamed of. Here was a girl of pride, character,\nvirtue, of education and breeding superior to his\nown  (he  felt  that),  and  this  creature  would  be\nslavishly  grateful  all  her  life  for  his  heroic\ncondescension,  and  would  humble  herself  in\nthe  dust  before  him,  and  he  would  have\nabsolute,  unbounded  power  over  her!  ...  Not\nlong  before,  he  had,  too,  after  long  reflection\nand hesitation, made an important change in his\n(cid:24)(cid:24) career and was now entering on a wider circle\nof  business.  With  this  change  his  cherished\ndreams  of  rising  into  a  higher  class  of  society\nseemed likely to be realised.... He was, in fact,\ndetermined to try his fortune in Petersburg. He\nknew  that  women  could  do  a  very  great  deal.\nThe  fascination  of  a  charming,  virtuous,  highly\neducated  woman  might  make  his  way  easier,", "might  do  wonders  in  attracting  people  to  him,\nthrowing  an  aureole  round  him,  and  now\neverything  was  in  ruins!  This  sudden  horrible\nrupture  affected  him  like  a  clap  of  thunder;  it\nwas  like  a  hideous  joke,  an  absurdity.  He  had\nonly been a tiny bit masterful, had not even time\nto  speak  out,  had  simply  made  a  joke,  been\ncarried  away  -and  it  had  ended  so  seriously.\nAnd,  of  course,  too,  he  did  love  Dounia  in  his\nown  way;  he  already  possessed  her  in  his\ndreams-and  all  at  once!  No!  The  next  day,  the\nvery next day, it must all be set right, smoothed\nover,  settled.  Above  all  he  must  crush  that\nconceited  milksop  who  was  the  cause  of  it  all.\nWith  a  sick  feeling  he  could  not  help  recalling\nRazumihin too, but, he soon reassured himself\non that score; as though a fellow like that could\nbe  put  on  a  level  with  him!  The  man  he  really\ndreaded in earnest was Svidrigaïlov.... He had,\nin short, a great deal to attend to....\n'No,  I,  I  am  more  to  blame  than  anyone!'  said\nDounia,  kissing  and  embracing  her  mother.  'I\nwas tempted by his money, but on my honour,\nbrother, I had no idea he was such a base man.\nIf I had seen through him before, nothing would\nhave tempted me! Don't blame me, brother!'", "'God  has  delivered  us!  God  has  delivered  us!'\nPulcheria  (cid:24)  Alexandrovna  muttered,  but  half\nconsciously,  as  though  scarcely  able  to  realise\nwhat had happened.\nThey were all relieved, and in five minutes they\nwere  laughing.  Only  now  and  then  Dounia\nturned  white  and  frowned,  remembering  what\nhad  passed.  Pulcheria  Alexandrovna  was\nsurprised  to  find  that  she,  too,  was  glad:  she\nhad  only  that  morning  thought  rupture  with\nLuzhin  a  terrible  misfortune.  Razumihin  was\ndelighted. He did not yet dare to express his joy\nfully,  but  he  was  in  a  fever  of  excitement  as\nthough  a  ton-weight  had  fallen  off  his  heart.\nNow he had the right to devote his life to them,\nto  serve  them....  Anything  might  happen  now!\nBut he felt afraid to think of further possibilities\nand dared not let his imagination range. But \nRaskolnikov  sat  still  in  the  same  place,  almost\nsullen and indifferent. Though he had been the\nmost  insistent  on  getting  rid  of  Luzhin,  he\nseemed  now  the  least  concerned  at  what  had\nhappened.  Dounia  could  not  help  thinking  that\nhe  was  still  angry  with  her,  and  Pulcheria", "Alexandrovna watched him timidly.\n'What did Svidrigaïlov say to you?' said Dounia,\napproaching him.\n'Yes, yes!' cried Pulcheria Alexandrovna.\nRaskolnikov raised his head.\n'He  wants  to  make  you  a  present  of  ten\nthousand  roubles  and  he  desires  to  see  you\nonce in my presence.'\n'See  her!  On  no  account!'  cried  Pulcheria\nAlexandrovna.  'And  how  dare  he  offer  her\nmoney!'Then  Raskolnikov  repeated  (rather\ndryly)  his  conversation  with  Svidrigaïlov,\nomitting his account of the ghostly (cid:24)(cid:24) visitations\nof  Marfa  Petrovna,  wishing  to  avoid  all\nunnecessary talk.\n'What answer did you give him?' asked Dounia.\n'At first I said I would not take any message to\nyou. Then he said that he would do his utmost\nto obtain an interview with you without my help.\nHe  assured  me  that  his  passion  for  you  was  a", "passing  infatuation,  now  he  has  no  feeling  for\nyou. He doesn't want you to marry Luzhin.... His\ntalk was altogether rather muddled.'\n'How  do  you  explain  him  to  yourself,  Rodya?\nHow did he strike you?'\n'I must confess I don't quite understand him. He\noffers you ten thousand, and yet says he is not\nwell  off.  He  says  he  is  going  away,  and  in  ten\nminutes he forgets he has said it. Then he says\nis he going to be married and has already fixed\non  the  girl....  No  doubt  he  has  a  motive,  and\nprobably a bad one. But it's odd that he should\nbe  so  clumsy  about  it  if  he  had  any  designs\nagainst  you....  Of  course,  I  refused  this  money\non  your  account,  once  for  all.  Altogether,  I\nthought  him  very  strange....  One  might  almost\nthink he was mad. But I may be mistaken; that\nmay only be the part he assumes. The death of\nMarfa  Petrovna  seems  to  have  made  a  great\nimpression on him.'\n'God  rest  her  soul,'  exclaimed  Pulcheria\nAlexandrovna.  'I  shall  always,  always  pray  for\nher! Where should we be now, Dounia, without\nthis three thousand! It's as though it had fallen", "from heaven! Why, Rodya, this morning we had\nonly three roubles in our pocket and Dounia and\nI were just planning to pawn her watch, so as to\navoid borrowing from (cid:24) that man until he offered\nhelp.'\nDounia  seemed  strangely  impressed  by\nSvidrigaïlov's offer. She still stood meditating.\n'He  has  got  some  terrible  plan,'  she  said  in  a\nhalf whisper to herself, almost shuddering.\nRaskolnikov noticed this disproportionate terror.\n'I fancy I shall have to see him more than once\nagain,' he said to Dounia.\n'We  will  watch  him!  I  will  track  him  out!'  cried\nRazumihin, vigorously. 'I won't lose sight of him.\nRodya  has  given  me  leave.  He  said  to  me\nhimself  just  now.  'Take  care  of  my  sister.'  Will\nyou give me leave, too, Avdotya Romanovna?'\nDounia  smiled  and  held  out  her  hand,  but  the\nlook of anxiety did not leave her face. Pulcheria\nAlexandrovna gazed at her timidly, but the three\nthousand  roubles  had  obviously  a  soothing", "effect on her.\nA  quarter  of  an  hour  later,  they  were  all\nengaged  in  a  lively  conversation.  Even\nRaskolnikov  listened  attentively  for  some  time,\nthough  he  did  not  talk.  Razumihin  was  the\nspeaker.\n'And why, why should you go away?' he flowed\non ecstatically. 'And what are you to do in a little\ntown?  The  great  thing  is,  you  are  all  here\ntogether  and  you  need  one  another-you  do\nneed  one  another,  believe  me.  For  a  time,\nanyway....  Take  me  into  partnership,  and  I\nassure  you  we'll  plan  a  capital  enterprise.\nListen! I'll explain it all in detail to you, the whole\nproject! It all flashed into my head this morning,\nbefore  anything  had  happened  ...  I  tell  you\nwhat;  I  have  an  uncle,  I  must  introduce  him  to\nyou (a most ac-(cid:24)(cid:24) commodating and respectable\nold  man).  This  uncle  has  got  a  capital  of  a\nthousand  roubles,  and  he  lives  on  his  pension\nand has no need of that money. For the last two\nyears  he  has  been  bothering  me  to  borrow  it\nfrom  him  and  pay  him  six  per  cent.  interest.  I\nknow what that means; he simply wants to help\nme. Last year I had no need of it, but this year I", "resolved  to  borrow  it  as  soon  as  he  arrived.\nThen  you  lend  me  another  thousand  of  your\nthree  and  we  have  enough  for  a  start,  so  we'll\ngo  into  partnership,  and  what  are  we  going  to\ndo?'\nThen  Razumihin  began  to  unfold  his  project,\nand  he  explained  at  length  that  almost  all  our\npublishers  and  booksellers  know  nothing  at  all\nof  what  they  are  selling,  and  for  that  reason\nthey  are  usually  bad  publishers,  and  that  any\ndecent  publications  pay  as  a  rule  and  give  a\nprofit,  sometimes  a  considerable  one.\nRazumihin  had,  indeed,  been  dreaming  of\nsetting up as a publisher. For the last two years\nhe had been working in publishers' offices, and\nknew  three  European  languages  well,  though\nhe had told Raskolnikov six days before that he\nwas  'schwach'  in  German  with  an  object  of\npersuading  him  to  take  half  his  translation  and\nhalf  the  payment  for  it.  He  had  told  a  lie  then,\nand Raskolnikov knew he was lying.\n'Why,  why  should  we  let  our  chance  slip  when\nwe  have  one  of  the  chief  means  of\nsuccess-money  of  our  own!'  cried  Razumihin\nwarmly.  'Of  course  there  will  be  a  lot  of  work,", "but  we  will  work,  you,  Avdotya  Romanovna,  I,\nRodion....  You  get  a  splendid  profit  on  some\nbooks  nowadays!  And  the  great  point  of  the\nbusiness  is  that  we  shall  know  just  what  (cid:24)(cid:24)0\nCrime  and  Punishment  wants  translating,  and\nwe  shall  be  translating,  publishing,  learning  all\nat  once.  I  can  be  of  use  because  I  have\nexperience.  For  nearly  two  years  I've  been\nscuttling about among the publishers, and now I\nknow  every  detail  of  their  business.  You  need\nnot  be  a  saint  to  make  pots,  believe  me!  And\nwhy, why should we let our chance slip! Why, I\nknow-and  I  kept  the  secret-two  or  three  books\nwhich  one  might  get  a  hundred  roubles  simply\nfor  thinking  of  translating  and  publishing.\nIndeed,  and  I  would  not  take  five  hundred  for\nthe very idea of one of them. And what do you\nthink?  If  I  were  to  tell  a  publisher,  I  dare  say\nhe'd hesitate-they are such blockheads! And as\nfor  the  business  side,  printing,  paper,  selling,\nyou  trust  to  me,  I  know  my  way  about.  We'll\nbegin  in  a  small  way  and  go  on  to  a  large.  In\nany case it will get us our living and we shall get\nback our capital.'\nDounia's eyes shone.", "'I  like  what  you  are  saying,  Dmitri  Prokofitch!'\nshe said.\n'I  know  nothing  about  it,  of  course,'  put  in\nPulcheria Alexandrovna, 'it may be a good idea,\nbut  again  God  knows.  It's  new  and  untried.  Of\ncourse, we must remain here at least for a time.'\nShe looked at Rodya.\n'What do you think, brother?' said Dounia.\n'I think he's got a very good idea,' he answered.\n'Of  course,  it's  too  soon  to  dream  of  a\npublishing firm, but we certainly might bring out\nfive or six books and be sure of success. I know\nof  one  book  myself  which  would  be  sure  to  go\nwell.  And  as  for  his  being  able  to  manage  it,\nthere's no doubt about that either. He knows the\nbusiness....

He  held  his  cap  in  his  hand,  he  was\npreparing to leave them.\n'One would think you were burying me or saying\ngoodbye for ever,' he said somewhat oddly. He\nattempted  to  smile,  but  it  did  not  turn  out  a\nsmile.  'But  who  knows,  perhaps  it  is  the  last\ntime  we  shall  see  each  other  ...'  he  let  slip\naccidentally. It was what he was thinking, and it\nsomehow was uttered aloud.\n'What is the matter with you?' cried his mother.\n'Where  are  you  going,  Rodya?'  asked  Dounia\nrather strangely.\n'Oh,  I'm  quite  obliged  to  ...'  he  answered\nvaguely,  as  though  hesitating  what  he  would", "say.  But  there  was  a  look  of  sharp\ndetermination in his white face.\n'I  meant  to  say  ...  as  I  was  coming  here  ...

Both\nhis mother and his sister were terribly alarmed.\nRazumihin was also.\n'Rodya, Rodya, be reconciled with us!

I'm  coming,'  he\nmuttered  in  an  undertone,  as  though  not  fully\nconscious of what he was saying, and he went\nout of the room.\n'Wicked, heartless egoist!' cried Dounia.\n'He  is  insane,  but  not  heartless.  He  is  mad!\nDon't  you  see  it?  You're  heartless  after  that!'\nRazumihin whispered in her ear, squeezing her\nhand  tightly.  'I  shall  be  back  directly,'  he\nshouted  to  the  horror-  stricken  mother,  and  he\nran out of the room.\nRaskolnikov  was  waiting  for  him  at  the  end  of\nthe pas-(cid:24)(cid:24) sage.\n'I  knew  you  would  run  after  me,'  he  said.

Razumihin muttered, at his wits' end.\nRaskolnikov stopped once more.\n'Once  for  all,  never  ask  me  about  anything.  I\nhave nothing to tell you. Don't come to see me.\nMaybe  I'll  come  here....  Leave  me,  but  don't\nleave them. Do you understand me?'\nIt  was  dark  in  the  corridor,  they  were  standing\nnear  the  lamp.  For  a  minute  they  were  looking\nat  one  another  in  silence.  Razumihin\nremembered  that  minute  all  his  life.\nRaskolnikov's  burning  and  intent  eyes  grew\nmore  penetrating  every  moment,  piercing  into\nhis  soul,  into  his  consciousness.  Suddenly\nRazumihin  started.  Something  strange,  as  it\nwere,  passed  between  them....  Some  idea,\nsome hint, as it were, slipped, something awful,\nhideous,  and  suddenly  understood  on  both", "sides.... Razumihin turned pale.\n'Do you understand now?' said Raskolnikov, his\nface twitching nervously. 'Go back, go to them,'\nhe  said  suddenly,  and  turning  quickly,  he  went\nout of the house.\nI  will  not  attempt  to  describe  how  Razumihin\nwent back to the ladies, how he soothed them,\nhow he protested that Rodya needed rest in his\nillness, protested that Rodya was sure to come,\nthat  he  would  come  every  day,  that  he  was\nvery,  very  much  upset,  that  he  must  not  be\nirritated, that he, (cid:24) Razumihin, would watch over\nhim, would get him a doctor, the best doctor, a\nconsultation....  In  fact  from  that  evening\nRazumihin  took  his  place  with  them  as  a  son\nand a brother.(cid:24)(cid:24) ", "#$#$Chapter 27#$#$\nRaskolnikov  went  straight  to  the  house  on  the\ncanal bank \nwhere Sonia lived. It was an old green house of\nthree storeys. He found the porter and obtained\nfrom  him  vague  directions  as  to  the\nwhereabouts  of  Kapernaumov,  the  tailor.\nHaving found in the corner of the courtyard the\nentrance  to  the  dark  and  narrow  staircase,  he\nmounted to the second floor and came out into\na  gallery  that  ran  round  the  whole  second\nstorey over the yard. While he was wandering in\nthe  darkness,  uncertain  where  to  turn  for\nKapernaumov's  door,  a  door  opened  three\npaces from him; he mechanically took hold of it.\n'Who  is  there?'  a  woman's  voice  asked\nuneasily.\n'It's  I  ...  come  to  see  you,'  answered\nRaskolnikov and he walked into the tiny entry.\nOn a broken chair stood a candle in a battered", "copper candlestick.\n'It's  you!  Good  heavens!'  cried  Sonia  weakly,\nand she stood rooted to the spot.\n'Which  is  your  room?  This  way?'  and\nRaskolnikov, trying not to look at her, hastened\nin.\nA  minute  later  Sonia,  too,  came  in  with  the\ncandle,  set  down  the  candlestick  and,\ncompletely  disconcerted,  stood  before  him\ninexpressibly agitated and apparently frightened\nby  his  unexpected  visit.  The  colour  rushed\nsuddenly (cid:24) to her pale face and tears came into\nher  eyes  ...  She  felt  sick  and  ashamed  and\nhappy,  too....  Raskolnikov  turned  away  quickly\nand sat on a chair by the table. He scanned the\nroom in a rapid glance.\nIt  was  a  large  but  exceedingly  low-pitched\nroom, the only one let by the Kapernaumovs, to\nwhose  rooms  a  closed  door  led  in  the  wall  on\nthe  left.  In  the  opposite  side  on  the  right  hand\nwall was another door, always kept locked. That\nled  to  the  next  flat,  which  formed  a  separate\nlodging. Sonia's room looked like a barn; it was", "a  very  irregular  quadrangle  and  this  gave  it  a\ngrotesque  appearance.  A  wall  with  three\nwindows looking out on to the canal ran aslant\nso  that  one  corner  formed  a  very  acute  angle,\nand  it  was  difficult  to  see  in  it  without  very\nstrong  light.  The  other  corner  was\ndisproportionately  obtuse.  There  was  scarcely\nany  furniture  in  the  big  room:  in  the  corner  on\nthe right was a bedstead, beside it, nearest the\ndoor,  a  chair.  A  plain,  deal  table  covered  by  a\nblue cloth stood against the same wall, close to\nthe  door  into  the  other  flat.  Two  rush-bottom\nchairs stood by the table. On the opposite wall\nnear  the  acute  angle  stood  a  small  plain\nwooden  chest  of  drawers  looking,  as  it  were,\nlost  in  a  desert.  That  was  all  there  was  in  the\nroom.  The  yellow,  scratched  and  shabby  wall-\npaper  was  black  in  the  corners.  It  must  have\nbeen  damp  and  full  of  fumes  in  the  winter.\nThere  was  every  sign  of  poverty;  even  the\nbedstead had no curtain.\nSonia looked in silence at her visitor, who was\nso attentively and unceremoniously scrutinising\nher  room,  and  even  began  at  last  to  tremble\nwith  terror,  as  though  she  was  (cid:24)(cid:24)  standing\nbefore  her  judge  and  the  arbiter  of  her", "destinies.\n'I  am  late....  It's  eleven,  isn't  it?'  he  asked,  still\nnot lifting his eyes.\n'Yes,' muttered Sonia, 'oh yes, it is,' she added,\nhastily,  as  though  in  that  lay  her  means  of\nescape. 'My landlady's clock has just struck ... I\nheard it myself....'\n'I've come to you for the last time,' Raskolnikov\nwent  on  gloomily,  although  this  was  the  first\ntime. 'I may perhaps not see you again ...'\n'Are you ... going away?'\n'I don't know ... to-morrow....'\n'Then you are not coming to Katerina Ivanovna\nto-morrow?' Sonia's voice shook.\n'I don't know.

Sit down,' he said in a\nchanged voice, gentle and friendly.\nShe  sat  down.  He  looked  kindly  and  almost\ncompassionately at her.\n'How  thin  you  are!  What  a  hand!  Quite\ntransparent, like a dead hand.'\nHe took her hand. Sonia smiled faintly.\n'I have always been like that,' she said.\n'Even when you lived at home?''Yes.'\n'Of  course,  you  were,'  he  added  abruptly  and\nthe expres(cid:24) sion of his face and the sound of his\nvoice changed again suddenly.\nHe looked round him once more.\n'You rent this room from the Kapernaumovs?'\n'Yes....'\n'They live there, through that door?'", "'Yes.... They have another room like this.'\n'All in one room?''Yes.'\n'I  should  be  afraid  in  your  room  at  night,'  he\nobserved gloomily.\n'They  are  very  good  people,  very  kind,'\nanswered  Sonia,  who  still  seemed  bewildered,\n'and all the furniture, everything ... everything is\ntheirs. And they are very kind and the children,\ntoo, often come to see me.'\n'They all stammer, don't they?'\n'Yes....  He  stammers  and  he's  lame.  And  his\nwife,  too....  It's  not  exactly  that  she  stammers,\nbut  she  can't  speak  plainly.  She  is  a  very  kind\nwoman.  And  he  used  to  be  a  house  serf.  And\nthere  are  seven  children  ...  and  it's  only  the\neldest  one  that  stammers  and  the  others  are\nsimply ill ... but they don't stammer.... But where\ndid you hear about them?' she added with some\nsurprise.\n'Your father told me, then. He told me all about", "you.... And how you went out at six o'clock and\ncame back at nine and how Katerina Ivanovna\nknelt down by your bed.'\nSonia was confused.\n'I  fancied  I  saw  him  to-day,'  she  whispered\nhesitatingly.\n'Whom?'(cid:24)(cid:24)  'Father.  I  was  walking  in  the  street,\nout there at the corner, about ten o'clock and he\nseemed to be walking in front. It looked just like\nhim. I wanted to go to Katerina Ivanovna....'\n'You were walking in the streets?'\n'Yes,'  Sonia  whispered  abruptly,  again\novercome with confusion and looking down.\n'Katerina  Ivanovna  used  to  beat  you,  I  dare\nsay?'\n'Oh no, what are you saying? No!' Sonia looked\nat him almost with dismay.\n'You love her, then?'", "'Love her? Of course!' said Sonia with plaintive\nemphasis,  and  she  clasped  her  hands  in\ndistress. 'Ah, you don't.... If you only knew! You\nsee, she is quite like a child.... Her mind is quite\nunhinged,  you  see  ...  from  sorrow.  And  how\nclever she used to be ... how generous ... how\nkind!  Ah,  you  don't  understand,  you  don't\nunderstand!'\nSonia  said  this  as  though  in  despair,  wringing\nher hands in excitement and distress. Her pale\ncheeks flushed, there was a look of anguish in\nher eyes. It was clear that she was stirred to the\nvery  depths,  that  she  was  longing  to  speak,  to\nchampion,  to  express  something.  A  sort  of\ninsatiable compassion, if one may so express it,\nwas reflected in every feature of her face.\n'Beat  me!  how  can  you?  Good  heavens,  beat\nme! And if she did beat me, what then? What of\nit? You know nothing, nothing about it.... She is\nso unhappy ... ah, how unhappy! And ill.... She\nis seeking righteousness, she is pure. She has\nsuch  faith  that  there  must  be  righteousness\neverywhere (cid:24)(cid:24)0 Crime and Punishment and she\nexpects it.... And if you were to torture her, she\nwouldn't  do  wrong.  She  doesn't  see  that  it's", "impossible for people to be righteous and she is\nangry  at  it.  Like  a  child,  like  a  child.  She  is\ngood!'\n'And what will happen to you?'\nSonia looked at him inquiringly.\n'They  are  left  on  your  hands,  you  see.  They\nwere  all  on  your  hands  before,  though....  And\nyour  father  came  to  you  to  beg  for  drink.  Well,\nhow will it be now?'\n'I don't know,' Sonia articulated mournfully.\n'Will they stay there?'\n'I don't know.... They are in debt for the lodging,\nbut  the  landlady,  I  hear,  said  to-day  that  she\nwanted  to  get  rid  of  them,  and  Katerina\nIvanovna  says  that  she  won't  stay  another\nminute.'\n'How is it she is so bold? She relies upon you?'\n'Oh,  no,  don't  talk  like  that....  We  are  one,  we\nlive  like  one.'  Sonia  was  agitated  again  and", "even angry, as though a canary or some other\nlittle bird were to be angry. 'And what could she\ndo?  What,  what  could  she  do?'  she  persisted,\ngetting  hot  and  excited.  'And  how  she  cried\nto-day!  Her  mind  is  unhinged,  haven't  you\nnoticed it? At one minute she is worrying like a\nchild that everything should be right to-morrow,\nthe  lunch  and  all  that....  Then  she  is  wringing\nher  hands,  spitting  blood,  weeping,  and  all  at\nonce  she  will  begin  knocking  her  head  against\nthe wall, in despair. Then she will be comforted\nagain.  She  builds  all  her  hopes  on  you;  she\nsays that you will help her now and that she will\nborrow a little money somewhere and go to her\nnative  town  (cid:24)1  with  me  and  set  up  a  boarding\nschool for the daughters of gentlemen and take\nme  to  superintend  it,  and  we  will  begin  a  new\nsplendid  life.  And  she  kisses  and  hugs  me,\ncomforts me, and you know she has such faith,\nsuch  faith  in  her  fancies!  One  can't  contradict\nher. And all the day long she has been washing,\ncleaning,  mending.  She  dragged  the  wash  tub\ninto  the  room  with  her  feeble  hands  and  sank\non  the  bed,  gasping  for  breath.  We  went  this\nmorning to the shops to buy shoes for Polenka\nand Lida for theirs are quite worn out. Only the\nmoney  we'd  reckoned  wasn't  enough,  not", "nearly  enough.  And  she  picked  out  such  dear\nlittle  boots,  for  she  has  taste,  you  don't  know.\nAnd  there  in  the  shop  she  burst  out  crying\nbefore  the  shopmen  because  she  hadn't\nenough.... Ah, it was sad to see her....'\n'Well, after that I can understand your living like\nthis,' Raskolnikov said with a bitter smile.\n'And  aren't  you  sorry  for  them?  Aren't  you\nsorry?'  Sonia  flew  at  him  again.  'Why,  I  know,\nyou gave your last penny yourself, though you'd\nseen nothing of it, and if you'd seen everything,\noh dear! And how often, how often I've brought\nher to tears! Only last week! Yes, I! Only a week\nbefore his death. I was cruel! And how often I've\ndone it! Ah, I've been wretched at the thought of\nit all day!'\nSonia  wrung  her  hands  as  she  spoke  at  the\npain of remembering it.\n'You were cruel?'\n'Yes,  I-I.  I  went  to  see  them,'  she  went  on,\nweeping, 'and father said, 'read me something,\nSonia,  my  head  aches,  read  to  me,  here's  a", "book.' He had a book he had got from Andrey (cid:24)\nSemyonovitch Lebeziatnikov, he lives there, he\nalways  used  to  get  hold  of  such  funny  books.\nAnd I said, 'I can't stay,' as I didn't want to read,\nand  I'd  gone  in  chiefly  to  show  Katerina\nIvanovna  some  collars.  Lizaveta,  the  pedlar,\nsold  me  some  collars  and  cuffs  cheap,  pretty,\nnew,  embroidered  ones.  Katerina  Ivanovna\nliked  them  very  much;  she  put  them  on  and\nlooked at herself in the glass and was delighted\nwith them. 'Make me a present of them, Sonia,'\nshe said, 'please do.' 'Please do ' she said, she\nwanted  them  so  much.  And  when  could  she\nwear  them?  They  just  reminded  her  of  her  old\nhappy days. She looked at herself in the glass,\nadmired herself, and she has no clothes at all,\nno things of her own, hasn't had all these years!\nAnd she never asks anyone for anything; she is\nproud, she'd sooner give away everything. And\nthese  she  asked  for,  she  liked  them  so  much.\nAnd  I  was  sorry  to  give  them.  'What  use  are\nthey to you, Katerina Ivanovna?' I said. I spoke\nlike  that  to  her,  I  ought  not  to  have  said  that!\nShe  gave  me  such  a  look.  And  she  was  so\ngrieved,  so  grieved  at  my  refusing  her.  And  it\nwas so sad to see.... And she was not grieved\nfor  the  collars,  but  for  my  refusing,  I  saw  that.", "Ah,  if  only  I  could  bring  it  all  back,  change  it,\ntake back those words! Ah, if I ... but it's nothing\nto you!'\n'Did you know Lizaveta, the pedlar?'\n'Yes....  Did  you  know  her?'  Sonia  asked  with\nsome surprise.\n'Katerina  Ivanovna  is  in  consumption,  rapid\nconsumption;  she  will  soon  die,'  said\nRaskolnikov  after  a  pause,  without  answering\nher question.\n'Oh,  no,  no,  no!'(cid:24)(cid:24)  And  Sonia  unconsciously\nclutched  both  his  hands,  as  though  imploring\nthat she should not.\n'But it will be better if she does die.'\n'No,  not  better,  not  at  all  better!'  Sonia\nunconsciously repeated in dismay.\n'And the children? What can you do except take\nthem to live with you?'\n'Oh,  I  don't  know,'  cried  Sonia,  almost  in", "despair, and she put her hands to her head.\nIt  was  evident  that  that  idea  had  very  often\noccurred to her before and he had only roused\nit again.\n'And,  what,  if  even  now,  while  Katerina\nIvanovna  is  alive,  you  get  ill  and  are  taken  to\nthe  hospital,  what  will  happen  then?'  he\npersisted pitilessly.\n'How can you? That cannot be!'\nAnd Sonia's face worked with awful terror.\n'Cannot be?' Raskolnikov went on with a harsh\nsmile. 'You are not insured against it, are you?\nWhat will happen to them then? They will be in\nthe  street,  all  of  them,  she  will  cough  and  beg\nand knock her head against some wall, as she\ndid to-day, and the children will cry.... Then she\nwill fall down, be taken to the police station and\nto the hospital, she will die, and the children ...'\n'Oh,  no....  God  will  not  let  it  be!'  broke  at  last\nfrom Sonia's overburdened bosom.", "She  listened,  looking  imploringly  at  him,\nclasping her hands in dumb entreaty, as though\nit all depended upon him.\nRaskolnikov got up and began to walk about the\nroom.  A  (cid:24)  minute  passed.  Sonia  was  standing\nwith her hands and her head hanging in terrible\ndejection.\n'And can't you save? Put by for a rainy day?' he\nasked, stopping suddenly before her.\n'No,' whispered Sonia.\n'Of  course  not.  Have  you  tried?'  he  added\nalmost ironically.'Yes.'\n'And it didn't come off! Of course not! No need\nto ask.'\nAnd  again  he  paced  the  room.  Another  minute\npassed.\n'You don't get money every day?'\nSonia was more confused than ever and colour\nrushed into her face again.", "'No,' she whispered with a painful effort.\n'It will be the same with Polenka, no doubt,' he\nsaid suddenly.\n'No,  no!  It  can't  be,  no!'  Sonia  cried  aloud  in\ndesperation, as though she had been stabbed.\n'God would not allow anything so awful!'\n'He lets others come to it.'\n'No,  no!  God  will  protect  her,  God!'  she\nrepeated beside herself.\n'But,  perhaps,  there  is  no  God  at  all,'\nRaskolnikov  answered  with  a  sort  of\nmalignance, laughed and looked at her.\nSonia's  face  suddenly  changed;  a  tremor\npassed  over  it.  She  looked  at  him  with\nunutterable  reproach,  tried  to  say  something,\nbut could not speak and broke into bitter, bitter\nsobs,  hiding  her  face  in  her  hands.(cid:24)(cid:24)  'You  say\nKaterina Ivanovna's mind is unhinged; your own\nmind is unhinged,' he said after a brief silence.", "Five  minutes  passed.  He  still  paced  up  and\ndown the room in silence, not looking at her. At\nlast he went up to her; his eyes glittered. He put\nhis  two  hands  on  her  shoulders  and  looked\nstraight  into  her  tearful  face.  His  eyes  were\nhard,  feverish  and  piercing,  his  lips  were\ntwitching. All at once he bent down quickly and\ndropping  to  the  ground,  kissed  her  foot.  Sonia\ndrew  back  from  him  as  from  a  madman.  And\ncertainly he looked like a madman.\n'What  are  you  doing  to  me?'  she  muttered,\nturning pale, and a sudden anguish clutched at\nher heart.\nHe stood up at once.\n'I did not bow down to you, I bowed down to all\nthe  suffering  of  humanity,'  he  said  wildly  and\nwalked away to the window. 'Listen,' he added,\nturning to her a minute later. 'I said just now to\nan insolent man that he was not worth your little\nfinger ... and that I did my sister honour making\nher sit beside you.'\n'Ach,  you  said  that  to  them!  And  in  her\npresence?'  cried  Sonia,  frightened.  'Sit  down", "with  me!  An  honour!  Why,  I'm  ...\ndishonourable.... Ah, why did you say that?'\n'It was not because of your dishonour and your\nsin I said that of you, but because of your great\nsuffering. But you are a great sinner, that's true,'\nhe added almost solemnly, 'and your worst sin\nis  that  you  have  destroyed  and  betrayed\nyourself  for  nothing.  Isn't  that  fearful?  Isn't  it\nfearful that you are living in this filth which you\nloathe  so,  and  at  the  same  time  you  know\nyourself  (you've  only  to  open  your  eyes)  that\nyou  (cid:24)  are  not  helping  anyone  by  it,  not  saving\nanyone  from  anything?  Tell  me,'  he  went  on\nalmost  in  a  frenzy,  'how  this  shame  and\ndegradation  can  exist  in  you  side  by  side  with\nother,  opposite,  holy  feelings?  It  would  be\nbetter,  a  thousand  times  better  and  wiser  to\nleap into the water and end it all!'\n'But what would become of them?' Sonia asked\nfaintly, gazing at him with eyes of anguish, but\nnot seeming surprised at his suggestion.\nRaskolnikov looked strangely at her. He read it\nall  in  her  face;  so  she  must  have  had  that\nthought  already,  perhaps  many  times,  and", "earnestly  she  had  thought  out  in  her  despair\nhow  to  end  it  and  so  earnestly,  that  now  she\nscarcely  wondered  at  his  suggestion.  She  had\nnot even noticed the cruelty of his words. (The\nsignificance  of  his  reproaches  and  his  peculiar\nattitude  to  her  shame  she  had,  of  course,  not\nnoticed either, and that, too, was clear to him.)\nBut he saw how monstrously the thought of her\ndisgraceful, shameful position was torturing her\nand  had  long  tortured  her.  'What,  what,'  he\nthought, 'could hitherto have hindered her from\nputting an end to it?' Only then he realised what\nthose  poor  little  orphan  children  and  that  pitiful\nhalf-crazy  Katerina  Ivanovna,  knocking  her\nhead  against  the  wall  in  her  consumption,\nmeant for Sonia.\nBut, nevertheless, it was clear to him again that\nwith her character and the amount of education\nshe had after all received, she could not in any\ncase remain so. He was still confronted by the\nquestion, how could she have remained so long\nin  that  position  without  going  out  of  her  mind,\nsince  she  could  not  bring  herself  to  jump  into\nthe  water?  (cid:24)(cid:24)  Of  course  he  knew  that  Sonia's\nposition  was  an  exceptional  case,  though\nunhappily  not  unique  and  not  infrequent,", "indeed; but that very exceptionalness, her tinge\nof education, her previous life might, one would\nhave thought, have killed her at the first step on\nthat revolting path. What held her up-surely not\ndepravity?  All  that  infamy  had  obviously  only\ntouched her mechanically, not one drop of real\ndepravity  had  penetrated  to  her  heart;  he  saw\nthat.  He  saw  through  her  as  she  stood  before\nhim....\n'There  are  three  ways  before  her,'  he  thought,\n'the  canal,  the  madhouse,  or  ...  at  last  to  sink\ninto  depravity  which  obscures  the  mind  and\nturns the heart to stone.'\nThe  last  idea  was  the  most  revolting,  but  he\nwas  a  sceptic,  he  was  young,  abstract,  and\ntherefore  cruel,  and  so  he  could  not  help\nbelieving that the last end was the most likely.\n'But can that be true?' he cried to himself. 'Can\nthat  creature  who  has  still  preserved  the  purity\nof  her  spirit  be  consciously  drawn  at  last  into\nthat  sink  of  filth  and  iniquity?  Can  the  process\nalready  have  begun?  Can  it  be  that  she  has\nonly been able to bear it till now, because vice\nhas begun to be less loathsome to her? No, no,", "that  cannot  be!'  he  cried,  as  Sonia  had  just\nbefore. 'No, what has kept her from the canal till\nnow is the idea of sin and they, the children....\nAnd if she has not gone out of her mind ... but\nwho says she has not gone out of her mind? Is\nshe  in  her  senses?  Can  one  talk,  can  one\nreason  as  she  does?  How  can  she  sit  on  the\nedge of the abyss of loathsomeness into which\nshe is slipping and refuse to listen when she is\ntold of danger? Does she expect a miracle? No\ndoubt  she  does.  Doesn't  that  all  mean  mad(cid:24)\nness?'\nHe  stayed  obstinately  at  that  thought.  He  liked\nthat  explanation  indeed  better  than  any  other.\nHe began looking more intently at her.\n'So  you  pray  to  God  a  great  deal,  Sonia?'  he\nasked her.\nSonia  did  not  speak;  he  stood  beside  her\nwaiting for an answer.\n'What should I be without God?' she whispered\nrapidly,  forcibly,  glancing  at  him  with  suddenly\nflashing eyes, and squeezing his hand.", "'Ah, so that is it!' he thought.\n'And  what  does  God  do  for  you?'  he  asked,\nprobing her further.\nSonia  was  silent  a  long  while,  as  though  she\ncould not answer. Her weak chest kept heaving\nwith emotion.\n'Be  silent!  Don't  ask!  You  don't  deserve!'  she\ncried suddenly, looking sternly and wrathfully at\nhim.\n'That's it, that's it,' he repeated to himself.\n'He  does  everything,'  she  whispered  quickly,\nlooking down again.\n'That's  the  way  out!  That's  the  explanation,'  he\ndecided,  scrutinising  her  with  eager  curiosity,\nwith a new, strange, almost morbid feeling. He\ngazed  at  that  pale,  thin,  irregular,  angular  little\nface,  those  soft  blue  eyes,  which  could  flash\nwith such fire, such stern energy, that little body\nstill shaking with indignation and anger-and it all\nseemed to him more and more strange, almost\nimpossible.  'She  is  a  religious  maniac!'  he", "repeated to himself.\nThere was a book lying on the chest of drawers.\nHe had (cid:24)(cid:24) noticed it every time he paced up and\ndown the room. Now he took it up and looked at\nit.  It  was  the  New  Testament  in  the  Russian\ntranslation.  It  was  bound  in  leather,  old  and\nworn.\n'Where  did  you  get  that?'  he  called  to  her\nacross the room.\nShe was still standing in the same place, three\nsteps from the table.\n'It  was  brought  me,'  she  answered,  as  it  were\nunwillingly, not looking at him.\n'Who brought it?'\n'Lizaveta, I asked her for it.'\n'Lizaveta! strange!' he thought.\nEverything about Sonia seemed to him stranger\nand more wonderful every moment. He carried\nthe  book  to  the  candle  and  began  to  turn  over", "the pages.\n'Where  is  the  story  of  Lazarus?'  he  asked\nsuddenly.\nSonia  looked  obstinately  at  the  ground  and\nwould not answer. She was standing sideways\nto the table.\n'Where is the raising of Lazarus? Find it for me,\nSonia.'\nShe stole a glance at him.\n'You  are  not  looking  in  the  right  place....  It's  in\nthe  fourth  gospel,'  she  whispered  sternly,\nwithout looking at him.\n'Find it and read it to me,' he said. He sat down\nwith his elbow on the table, leaned his head on\nhis hand and looked away sullenly, prepared to\nlisten.\n'In three weeks' time they'll welcome me in the\nmadhouse! I shall be there if I am not in a worse\nplace,'  he  muttered  to  himself.(cid:24)(cid:24)0  Crime  and\nPunishment  Sonia    heard    Raskolnikov's ", "request  distrustfully  and moved hesitatingly to\nthe table. She took the book however.\n'Haven't  you  read  it?'  she  asked,  looking  up  at\nhim across the table.\nHer voice became sterner and sterner.\n'Long ago.... When I was at school. Read!'\n'And haven't you heard it in church?'\n'I ... haven't been. Do you often go?'\n'N-no,' whispered Sonia.\nRaskolnikov smiled.\n'I  understand....  And  you  won't  go  to  your\nfather's funeral to-morrow?'\n'Yes, I shall. I was at church last week, too ... I\nhad a requiem service.'\n'For whom?'\n'For Lizaveta. She was killed with an axe.'", "His  nerves  were  more  and  more  strained.  His\nhead began to go round.\n'Were you friends with Lizaveta?'\n'Yes....  She  was  good  ...  she  used  to  come  ...\nnot  often  ...  she  couldn't....  We  used  to  read\ntogether and ... talk. She will see God.'\nThe  last  phrase  sounded  strange  in  his  ears.\nAnd  here  was  something  new  again:  the\nmysterious  meetings  with  Lizaveta  and  both  of\nthem- religious maniacs.\n'I  shall  be  a  religious  maniac  myself  soon!  It's\ninfectious!'\n'Read!' he cried irritably and insistently.\nSonia  still  hesitated.  Her  heart  was  throbbing.\nShe  hardly  dared  to  read  to  him.  He  looked\nalmost  with  exasperation  (cid:24)1  at  the  'unhappy\nlunatic.'\n'What for? You don't believe? ...' she whispered\nsoftly and as it were breathlessly.", "'Read! I want you to,' he persisted. 'You used to\nread to Lizaveta.'\nSonia  opened  the  book  and  found  the  place.\nHer  hands  were  shaking,  her  voice  failed  her.\nTwice she tried to begin and could not bring out\nthe first syllable.\n'Now a certain man was sick named Lazarus of\nBethany  ...'  she  forced  herself  at  last  to  read,\nbut  at  the  third  word  her  voice  broke  like  an\noverstrained  string.  There  was  a  catch  in  her\nbreath.\nRaskolnikov  saw  in  part  why  Sonia  could  not\nbring  herself  to  read  to  him  and  the  more  he\nsaw  this,  the  more  roughly  and  irritably  he\ninsisted  on  her  doing  so.  He  understood  only\ntoo well how painful it was for her to betray and\nunveil all that was her own. He understood that\nthese  feelings  really  were  her  secret  treasure\nwhich she had kept perhaps for years, perhaps\nfrom childhood, while she lived with an unhappy\nfather  and  a  distracted  stepmother  crazed  by\ngrief,  in  the  midst  of  starving  children  and\nunseemly  abuse  and  reproaches.  But  at  the", "same  time  he  knew  now  and  knew  for  certain\nthat,  although  it  filled  her  with  dread  and\nsuffering,  yet  she  had  a  tormenting  desire  to\nread  and  to  read  to  him  that  he  might  hear  it,\nand  to  read  now  whatever  might  come  of  it!  ...\nHe read this in her eyes, he could see it in her\nintense  emotion.  She  mastered  herself,\ncontrolled the spasm in her throat and went on\nreading  the  eleventh  chapter  of  St.  John.  She\nwent on to the nineteenth verse:(cid:24) 'And many of\nthe  Jews  came  to  Martha  and  Mary  to  comfort\nthem concerning their brother.\n'Then Martha as soon as she heard that Jesus\nwas  coming  went  and  met  Him:  but  Mary  sat\nstill in the house.\n'Then  said  Martha  unto  Jesus,  Lord,  if  Thou\nhadst been here, my brother had not died.\n'But I know that even now whatsoever Thou wilt\nask of God, God will give it Thee....'\nThen  she  stopped  again  with  a  shamefaced\nfeeling  that  her  voice  would  quiver  and  break\nagain.", "'Jesus  said  unto  her,  thy  brother  shall  rise\nagain.\n'Martha saith unto Him, I know that he shall rise\nagain in the resurrection, at the last day.\n'Jesus said unto her, I am the resurrection and\nthe life: he that believeth in Me though he were\ndead, yet shall he live.\n'And whosoever liveth and believeth in Me shall\nnever die. Believest thou this?\n'She saith unto Him,'\n(And  drawing  a  painful  breath,  Sonia  read\ndistinctly  and  forcibly  as  though  she  were\nmaking a public confession of faith.)\n'Yea, Lord: I believe that Thou art the Christ, the\nSon of God Which should come into the world.'\nShe stopped and looked up quickly at him, but\ncontrolling herself went on reading. Raskolnikov\nsat without moving, his elbows on the table and\nhis  eyes  turned  away.  She  read  to  the\nthirty-second verse.", "'Then  when  Mary  was  come  where  Jesus  was\nand saw Him, she fell down at His feet, saying\nunto  Him,  Lord  if  (cid:24)(cid:24)  Thou  hadst  been  here,  my\nbrother had not died.\n'When  Jesus  therefore  saw  her  weeping,  and\nthe Jews also weeping which came with her, He\ngroaned in the spirit and was troubled,\n'And  said,  Where  have  ye  laid  him?  They  said\nunto Him, Lord, come and see.\n'Jesus wept.\n'Then said the Jews, behold how He loved him!\n'And  some  of  them  said,  could  not  this  Man\nwhich  opened  the  eyes  of  the  blind,  have\ncaused  that  even  this  man  should  not  have\ndied?'\nRaskolnikov  turned  and  looked  at  her  with\nemotion.  Yes,  he  had  known  it!  She  was\ntrembling  in  a  real  physical  fever.  He  had\nexpected  it.  She  was  getting  near  the  story  of\nthe  greatest  miracle  and  a  feeling  of  immense", "triumph came over her. Her voice rang out like\na bell; triumph and joy gave it power. The lines\ndanced before her eyes, but she knew what she\nwas  reading  by  heart.  At  the  last  verse  'Could\nnot this Man which opened the eyes of the blind\n...'  dropping  her  voice  she  passionately\nreproduced  the  doubt,  the  reproach  and\ncensure  of  the  blind  disbelieving  Jews,  who  in\nanother moment would fall at His feet as though\nstruck by thunder, sobbing and believing.... 'And\nhe,  he-too,  is  blinded  and  unbelieving,  he,  too,\nwill hear, he, too, will believe, yes, yes! At once,\nnow,' was what she was dreaming, and she was\nquivering with happy anticipation.\n'Jesus  therefore  again  groaning  in  Himself\ncometh to the grave. It was a cave, and a stone\nlay upon it.\n'Jesus  said,  Take  ye  away  the  stone.  Martha,\nthe  sister  of  (cid:24)  him  that  was  dead,  saith  unto\nHim,  Lord  by  this  time  he  stinketh:  for  he  hath\nbeen dead four days.'\nShe laid emphasis on the word four.\n'Jesus saith unto her, Said I not unto thee that if", "thou  wouldest  believe,  thou  shouldest  see  the\nglory of God?\n'Then they took away the stone from the place\nwhere  the  dead  was  laid.  And  Jesus  lifted  up\nHis  eyes  and  said,  Father,  I  thank  Thee  that\nThou hast heard Me.\n'And  I  knew  that  Thou  hearest  Me  always;  but\nbecause of the people which stand by I said it,\nthat they may believe that Thou hast sent Me.\n'And when He thus had spoken, He cried with a\nloud voice, Lazarus, come forth.\n'And he that was dead came forth.'\n(She  read  loudly,  cold  and  trembling  with\necstasy,  as  though  she  were  seeing  it  before\nher eyes.)\n'Bound hand and foot with graveclothes; and his\nface  was  bound  about  with  a  napkin.

She  still  trembled  feverishly.\nThe  candle-end  was  flickering  out  in  the\nbattered  candlestick,  dimly  lighting  up  in  the\npoverty-stricken  room  the  murderer  and  the\nharlot  who  had  so  strangely  been  read-(cid:24)(cid:24)  ing\ntogether the eternal book. Five minutes or more\npassed.\n'I  came  to  speak  of  something,'  Raskolnikov\nsaid  aloud,  frowning.  He  got  up  and  went  to\nSonia. She lifted her eyes to him in silence. His\nface was particularly stern and there was a sort\nof savage determination in it.\n'I  have  abandoned  my  family  to-day,'  he  said,\n'my  mother  and  sister.  I  am  not  going  to  see\nthem. I've broken with them completely.'\n'What  for?'  asked  Sonia  amazed.  Her  recent", "meeting  with  his  mother  and  sister  had  left  a\ngreat  impression  which  she  could  not  analyse.\nShe heard his news almost with horror.\n'I  have  only  you  now,'  he  added.  'Let  us  go\ntogether....  I've  come  to  you,  we  are  both\naccursed, let us go our way together!'\nHis  eyes  glittered  'as  though  he  were  mad,'\nSonia thought, in her turn.\n'Go  where?'  she  asked  in  alarm  and  she\ninvoluntarily stepped back.\n'How do I know? I only know it's the same road,\nI  know  that  and  nothing  more.  It's  the  same\ngoal!'\nShe looked at him and understood nothing. She\nknew  only  that  he  was  terribly,  infinitely\nunhappy.\n'No one of them will understand, if you tell them,\nbut I have understood. I need you, that is why I\nhave come to you.'\n'I don't understand,' whispered Sonia.", "'You'll  understand  later.  Haven't  you  done  the\nsame?

So  we  must  go  together  on  the  same\nroad! Let us go!'\n'What  for?  What's  all  this  for?'  said  Sonia,\nstrangely and violently agitated by his words.\n'What  for?  Because  you  can't  remain  like  this,\nthat's why! You must look things straight in the\nface  at  last,  and  not  weep  like  a  child  and  cry\nthat God won't allow it.

I  have\nchosen  you  out.  I'm  not  coming  to  you  to  ask\nforgiveness, but simply to tell you. I chose you\nout  long  ago  to  hear  this,  when  your  father\ntalked  of  you  and  when  Lizaveta  was  alive,  I\nthought  of  it.  Good-bye,  don't  shake  hands.\nTo-morrow!'\nHe  went  out.  Sonia  gazed  at  him  as  at  a\nmadman.  But  she  herself  was  like  one  insane\nand felt it. Her head was going round.\n'Good  heavens,  how  does  he  know  who  killed\nLizaveta?  What  did  those  words  mean?  It's\nawful!'  But  at  the  same  time  the  idea  did  not\nenter her head, not for a moment! 'Oh, he must\nbe  terribly  unhappy!  ...  He  has  abandoned  his\nmother  and  sister....  What  for?  What  has\nhappened? And what had he in his mind? What\ndid he say to her? He had kissed her foot and\nsaid ... said (yes, he had said it clearly) that he\ncould  not  live  without  her....  Oh,  merciful\nheavens!'", "Sonia  spent  the  whole  night  feverish  and\ndelirious.  She  jumped  up  from  time  to  time,\nwept and wrung her hands, then sank again into\nfeverish sleep and dreamt of Polenka, Katerina\nIvanovna  and  Lizaveta,  of  reading  the  gospel\nand him ... him with pale face, with burning eyes\n... kissing her (cid:24) feet, weeping.\nOn the other side of the door on the right, which\ndivided  Sonia's  room  from  Madame  Resslich's\nflat, was a room which had long stood empty. A\ncard was fixed on the gate and a notice stuck in\nthe windows over the canal advertising it to let.\nSonia had long been accustomed to the room's\nbeing  uninhabited.  But  all  that  time  Mr.\nSvidrigaïlov had been standing, listening at the\ndoor  of  the  empty  room.  When  Raskolnikov\nwent out he stood still, thought a moment, went\non  tiptoe  to  his  own  room  which  adjoined  the\nempty  one,  brought  a  chair  and  noiselessly\ncarried  it  to  the  door  that  led  to  Sonia's  room.\nThe conversation had struck him as interesting\nand  remarkable,  and  he  had  greatly  enjoyed\nit-so  much  so  that  he  brought  a  chair  that  he\nmight not in the future, to-morrow, for instance,\nhave to endure the inconvenience of standing a", "whole hour, but might listen in comfort.(cid:24)(cid:24) ", "#$#$Chapter 28#$#$\nWhen next morning at eleven o'clock punctually\nRaskolnikov  went  into  the  department  of  the\ninvestigation  of  criminal  causes  and  sent  his\nname in to Porfiry Petrovitch, he was surprised\nat being kept waiting so long: it was at least ten\nminutes  before  he  was  summoned.  He  had\nexpected that they would pounce upon him. But\nhe stood in the waiting- room, and people, who\napparently  had  nothing  to  do  with  him,  were\ncontinually passing to and fro before him. In the\nnext  room  which  looked  like  an  office,  several\nclerks  were  sitting  writing  and  obviously  they\nhad  no  notion  who  or  what  Raskolnikov  might\nbe.  He  looked  uneasily  and  suspiciously  about\nhim to see whether there was not some guard,\nsome  mysterious  watch  being  kept  on  him  to\nprevent  his  escape.  But  there  was  nothing  of\nthe  sort:  he  saw  only  the  faces  of  clerks\nabsorbed in petty details, then other people, no\none seemed to have any concern with him. He\nmight  go  where  he  liked  for  them.  The\nconviction  grew  stronger  in  him  that  if  that\nenigmatic  man  of  yesterday,  that  phantom", "sprung  out  of  the  earth,  had  seen  everything,\nthey would not have let him stand and wait like\nthat. And would they have waited till he elected\nto appear at eleven? Either the man had not yet\ngiven  information,  or  ...  or  simply  he  knew\nnothing,  had  seen  nothing  (and  how  could  he\nhave  seen  anything?)  and  so  all  that  had\nhappened to him the (cid:24)(cid:24)0 Crime and Punishment\nday  before  was  again  a  phantom  exaggerated\nby  his  sick  and  overstrained  imagination.  This\nconjecture  had  begun  to  grow  strong  the  day\nbefore, in the midst of all his alarm and despair.\nThinking  it  all  over  now  and  preparing  for  a\nfresh  conflict,  he  was  suddenly  aware  that  he\nwas  trembling-and  he  felt  a  rush  of  indignation\nat the thought that he was trembling with fear at\nfacing  that  hateful  Porfiry  Petrovitch.  What  he\ndreaded above all was meeting that man again;\nhe  hated  him  with  an  intense,  unmitigated\nhatred  and  was  afraid  his  hatred  might  betray\nhim.  His  indignation  was  such  that  he  ceased\ntrembling at once; he made ready to go in with\na  cold  and  arrogant  bearing  and  vowed  to\nhimself  to  keep  as  silent  as  possible,  to  watch\nand  listen  and  for  once  at  least  to  control  his\noverstrained  nerves.  At  that  moment  he  was\nsummoned to Porfiry Petrovitch.", "He  found  Porfiry  Petrovitch  alone  in  his  study.\nHis  study  was  a  room  neither  large  nor  small,\nfurnished  with  a  large  writing-table,  that  stood\nbefore a sofa, upholstered in checked material,\na bureau, a bookcase in the corner and several\nchairs-all  government  furniture,  of  polished\nyellow  wood.  In  the  further  wall  there  was  a\nclosed  door,  beyond  it  there  were  no  doubt\nother rooms. On Raskolnikov's entrance Porfiry\nPetrovitch had at once closed the door by which\nhe  had  come  in  and  they  remained  alone.  He\nmet  his  visitor  with  an  apparently  genial  and\ngood-tempered  air,  and  it  was  only  after  a  few\nminutes that Raskolnikov saw signs of a certain\nawkwardness  in  him,  as  though  he  had  been\nthrown  out  of  his  reckoning  or  caught  in\nsomething  very  secret.(cid:24)1  'Ah,  my  dear  fellow!\nHere you are ... in our domain' ... began Porfiry,\nholding out both hands to him. 'Come, sit down,\nold man ... or perhaps you don't like to be called\n'my  dear  fellow'  and  'old  man!'-/tout  court?\nPlease don't think it too familiar.... Here, on the\nsofa.'\nRaskolnikov  sat  down,  keeping  his  eyes  fixed\non  him.  'In  our  domain,'  the  apologies  for", "familiarity, the French phrase tout court were all\ncharacteristic signs.\n'He  held  out  both  hands  to  me,  but  he  did  not\ngive me one-he drew it back in time,' struck him\nsuspiciously.  Both  were  watching  each  other,\nbut when their eyes met, quick as lightning they\nlooked away.\n'I  brought  you  this  paper  ...  about  the  watch.\nHere it is. Is it all right or shall I copy it again?'\n'What? A paper? Yes, yes, don't be uneasy, it's\nall  right,'  Porfiry  Petrovitch  said  as  though  in\nhaste, and after he had said it he took the paper\nand looked at it. 'Yes, it's all right. Nothing more\nis  needed,'  he  declared  with  the  same  rapidity\nand he laid the paper on the table.\nA  minute  later  when  he  was  talking  of\nsomething else he took it from the table and put\nit on his bureau.\n'I  believe  you  said  yesterday  you  would  like  to\nquestion  me  ...  formally  ...  about  my\nacquaintance  with  the  murdered  woman?'\nRaskolnikov  was  beginning  again.  'Why  did  I", "put  in  'I  believe''  passed  through  his  mind  in  a\nflash. 'Why am I so uneasy at having put in that\n'I  believe'?'  came  in  a  second  flash.  And  he\nsuddenly  felt  that  his  uneasiness  at  the  mere\ncontact with Porfiry, at the first words, at the first\nlooks,  had  grown  in  an  instant  to  monstrous\nproportions,  (cid:24)  and  that  this  was  fearfully\ndangerous.  His  nerves  were  quivering,  his\nemotion was increasing. 'It's bad, it's bad! I shall\nsay too much again.'\n'Yes,  yes,  yes!  There's  no  hurry,  there's  no\nhurry,'  muttered  Porfiry  Petrovitch,  moving  to\nand  fro  about  the  table  without  any  apparent\naim,  as  it  were  making  dashes  towards  the\nwindow,  the  bureau  and  the  table,  at  one\nmoment  avoiding  Raskolnikov's  suspicious\nglance, then again standing still and looking him\nstraight in the face.\nHis  fat  round  little  figure  looked  very  strange,\nlike a ball rolling from one side to the other and\nrebounding back.\n'We've plenty of time. Do you smoke? have you\nyour  own?  Here,  a  cigarette!'  he  went  on,\noffering  his  visitor  a  cigarette.  'You  know  I  am", "receiving  you  here,  but  my  own  quarters  are\nthrough  there,  you  know,  my  government\nquarters.  But  I  am  living  outside  for  the  time,  I\nhad to have some repairs done here. It's almost\nfinished  now....  Government  quarters,  you\nknow,  are  a  capital  thing.  Eh,  what  do  you\nthink?'\n'Yes,  a  capital  thing,'  answered  Raskolnikov,\nlooking at him almost ironically.\n'A capital thing, a capital thing,' repeated Porfiry\nPetrovitch,  as  though  he  had  just  thought  of\nsomething quite different. 'Yes, a capital thing,'\nhe  almost  shouted  at  last,  suddenly  staring  at\nRaskolnikov and stopping short two steps from\nhim.\nThis stupid repetition was too incongruous in its\nineptitude  with  the  serious,  brooding  and\nenigmatic glance he turned upon his visitor.\nBut this stirred Raskolnikov's spleen more than\never  and  (cid:24)(cid:24)  he  could  not  resist  an  ironical  and\nrather incautious challenge.\n'Tell  me,  please,'  he  asked  suddenly,  looking", "almost  insolently  at  him  and  taking  a  kind  of\npleasure  in  his  own  insolence.  'I  believe  it's  a\nsort of legal rule, a sort of legal tradition-for all\ninvestigating  lawyers-to  begin  their  attack  from\nafar,  with  a  trivial,  or  at  least  an  irrelevant\nsubject, so as to encourage, or rather, to divert\nthe man they are crossexamining, to disarm his\ncaution  and  then  all  at  once  to  give  him  an\nunexpected  knock-down  blow  with  some  fatal\nquestion.  Isn't  that  so?  It's  a  sacred  tradition,\nmentioned,  I  fancy,  in  all  the  manuals  of  the\nart?'\n'Yes, yes.... Why, do you imagine that was why\nI spoke about government quarters ... eh?'\nAnd  as  he  said  this  Porfiry  Petrovitch  screwed\nup  his  eyes  and  winked;  a  good-humoured,\ncrafty  look  passed  over  his  face.  The  wrinkles\non  his  forehead  were  smoothed  out,  his  eyes\ncontracted,  his  features  broadened  and  he\nsuddenly  went  off  into  a  nervous  prolonged\nlaugh, shaking all over and looking Raskolnikov\nstraight in the face. The latter forced himself to\nlaugh, too, but when Porfiry, seeing that he was\nlaughing,  broke  into  such  a  guffaw  that  he\nturned  almost  crimson,  Raskolnikov's  repulsion", "overcame  all  precaution;  he  left  off  laughing,\nscowled  and  stared  with  hatred  at  Porfiry,\nkeeping  his  eyes  fixed  on  him  while  his\nintentionally  prolonged  laughter  lasted.  There\nwas lack of precaution on both sides, however,\nfor Porfiry Petrovitch seemed to be laughing in\nhis visitor's face and to be very little disturbed at\nthe annoyance with which the visitor received it.\nThe  lat(cid:24)  ter  fact  was  very  significant  in\nRaskolnikov's  eyes:  he  saw  that  Porfiry\nPetrovitch  had  not  been  embarrassed  just\nbefore  either,  but  that  he,  Raskolnikov,  had\nperhaps  fallen  into  a  trap;  that  there  must  be\nsomething, some motive here unknown to him;\nthat, perhaps, everything was in readiness and\nin another moment would break upon him ...\nHe went straight to the point at once, rose from\nhis seat and took his cap.\n'Porfiry Petrovitch,' he began resolutely, though\nwith  considerable  irritation,  'yesterday  you\nexpressed  a  desire  that  I  should  come  to  you\nfor some inquiries' (he laid special stress on the\nword  'inquiries').  'I  have  come  and  if  you  have\nanything to ask me, ask it, and if not, allow me\nto withdraw. I have no time to spare.... I have to", "be at the funeral of that man who was run over,\nof  whom  you  ...  know  also,'  he  added,  feeling\nangry at once at having made this addition and\nmore irritated at his anger. 'I am sick of it all, do\nyou hear? and have long been. It's partly what\nmade  me  ill.  In  short,'  he  shouted,  feeling  that\nthe phrase about his illness was still more out of\nplace, 'in short, kindly examine me or let me go,\nat once. And if you must examine me, do so in\nthe  proper  form!  I  will  not  allow  you  to  do  so\notherwise, and so meanwhile, good-bye, as we\nhave evidently nothing to keep us now.'\n'Good heavens! What do you mean? What shall\nI question you about?' cackled Porfiry Petrovitch\nwith  a  change  of  tone,  instantly  leaving  off\nlaughing.  'Please  don't  disturb  yourself,'  he\nbegan fidgeting from place to place and fussily\nmaking Raskolnikov sit down. 'There's no hurry,\nthere's no (cid:24)(cid:24) hurry, it's all nonsense. Oh, no, I'm\nvery glad you've come to see me at last ... I look\nupon  you  simply  as  a  visitor.  And  as  for  my\nconfounded  laughter,  please  excuse  it,  Rodion\nRomanovitch.  Rodion  Romanovitch?  That  is\nyour name? ... It's my nerves, you tickled me so\nwith  your  witty  observation;  I  assure  you,\nsometimes  I  shake  with  laughter  like  an", "india-rubber ball for half an hour at a time.... I'm\noften  afraid  of  an  attack  of  paralysis.  Do  sit\ndown. Please do, or I shall think you are angry\n...'\nRaskolnikov  did  not  speak;  he  listened,\nwatching  him,  still  frowning  angrily.  He  did  sit\ndown, but still held his cap.\n'I must tell you one thing about myself, my dear\nRodion  Romanovitch,'  Porfiry  Petrovitch\ncontinued,  moving  about  the  room  and  again\navoiding  his  visitor's  eyes.  'You  see,  I'm  a\nbachelor,  a  man  of  no  consequence  and  not\nused to society; besides, I have nothing before\nme,  I'm  set,  I'm  running  to  seed  and  ...  and\nhave you noticed, Rodion Romanovitch, that in\nour  Petersburg  circles,  if  two  clever  men  meet\nwho  are  not  intimate,  but  respect  each  other,\nlike  you  and  me,  it  takes  them  half  an  hour\nbefore  they  can  find  a  subject  for\nconversation-they  are  dumb,  they  sit  opposite\neach  other  and  feel  awkward.  Everyone  has\nsubjects  of  conversation,  ladies  for  instance  ...\npeople  in  high  society  always  have  their\nsubjects  of  conversation,  c'est  de  rigueur  but\npeople  of  the  middle  sort  like  us,  thinking", "people  that  is,  are  always  tongue-tied  and\nawkward. What is the reason of it? Whether it is\nthe  lack  of  public  interest,  or  whether  it  is  we\nare  so  honest  we  don't  want  to  deceive  one\nanother, I don't know. (cid:24) What do you think? Do\nput down your cap, it looks as if you were just\ngoing,  it  makes  me  uncomfortable  ...  I  am  so\ndelighted ...'\nRaskolnikov  put  down  his  cap  and  continued\nlistening in silence with a serious frowning face\nto  the  vague  and  empty  chatter  of  Porfiry\nPetrovitch.  'Does  he  really  want  to  distract  my\nattention with his silly babble?'\n'I can't offer you coffee here; but why not spend\nfive minutes with a friend?' Porfiry pattered on,\n'and you know all these official duties ... please\ndon't mind my running up and down, excuse it,\nmy  dear  fellow,  I  am  very  much  afraid  of\noffending  you,  but  exercise  is  absolutely\nindispensable for me. I'm always sitting and so\nglad  to  be  moving  about  for  five  minutes  ...  I\nsuffer from my sedentary life ... I always intend\nto join a gymnasium; they say that officials of all\nranks,  even  Privy  Councillors,  may  be  seen\nskipping  gaily  there;  there  you  have  it,  modern", "science ... yes, yes.... But as for my duties here,\ninquiries  and  all  such  formalities  ...  you\nmentioned  inquiries  yourself  just  now  ...  I\nassure you these interrogations are sometimes\nmore embarrassing for the interrogator than for\nthe  interrogated....  You  made  the  observation\nyourself  just  now  very  aptly  and  wittily.'\n(Raskolnikov  had  made  no  observation  of  the\nkind.)  'One  gets  into  a  muddle!  A  regular\nmuddle! One keeps harping on the same note,\nlike  a  drum!  There  is  to  be  a  reform  and  we\nshall  be  called  by  a  different  name,  at  least,\nhe-he-he! And as for our legal tradition, as you\nso  wittily  called  it,  I  thoroughly  agree  with  you.\nEvery prisoner on trial, even the rudest peasant,\nknows that they begin by disarming him (cid:24)(cid:24) with\nirrelevant  questions  (as  you  so  happily  put  it)\nand  then  deal  him  a  knock-down  blow,\nhe-he-he!-your felicitous comparison, he-he! So\nyou really imagined that I meant by 'government\nquarters'  ...  he-he!  You  are  an  ironical  person.\nCome. I won't go on! Ah, by the way, yes! One\nword  leads  to  another.  You  spoke  of  formality\njust now, apropos of the inquiry, you know. But\nwhat's  the  use  of  formality?  In  many  cases  it's\nnonsense.  Sometimes  one  has  a  friendly  chat\nand  gets  a  good  deal  more  out  of  it.  One  can", "always  fall  back  on  formality,  allow  me  to\nassure  you.  And  after  all,  what  does  it  amount\nto? An examining lawyer cannot be bounded by\nformality  at  every  step.  The  work  of\ninvestigation is, so to speak, a free art in its own\nway, he-he-he!'\nPorfiry  Petrovitch  took  breath  a  moment.  He\nhad simply babbled on uttering empty phrases,\nletting  slip  a  few  enigmatic  words  and  again\nreverting  to  incoherence.  He  was  almost\nrunning about the room, moving his fat little legs\nquicker and quicker, looking at the ground, with\nhis right hand behind his back, while with his left\nmaking  gesticulations  that  were  extraordinarily\nincongruous  with  his  words.  Raskolnikov\nsuddenly noticed that as he ran about the room\nhe seemed twice to stop for a moment near the\ndoor, as though he were listening.\n'Is he expecting anything?'\n'You  are  certainly  quite  right  about  it,'  Porfiry\nbegan  gaily,    looking    with    extraordinary \nsimplicity    at    Raskolnikov  (which  startled  him\nand  instantly  put  him  on  his  guard);  'certainly\nquite  right  in  laughing  so  wittily  at  our  legal", "forms,  he-he!  Some  of  these  elaborate\npsychological  (cid:24)  methods  are  exceedingly\nridiculous and perhaps useless, if one adheres\ntoo closely to the forms. Yes ... I am talking of\nforms again. Well, if I recognise, or more strictly\nspeaking, if I suspect someone or other to be a\ncriminal  in  any  case  entrusted  to  me  ...  you're\nreading  for  the  law,  of  course,  Rodion\nRomanovitch?'\n'Yes, I was ...'\n'Well,  then  it  is  a  precedent  for  you  for  the\nfuture-though don't suppose I should venture to\ninstruct you after the articles you publish about\ncrime! No, I simply make bold to state it by way\nof  fact,  if  I  took  this  man  or  that  for  a  criminal,\nwhy,  I  ask,  should  I  worry  him  prematurely,\neven though I had evidence against him? In one\ncase  I  may  be  bound,  for  instance,  to  arrest  a\nman  at  once,  but  another  may  be  in  quite  a\ndifferent position, you know, so why shouldn't I\nlet him walk about the town a bit? he-he-he! But\nI see you don't quite understand, so I'll give you\na  clearer  example.  If  I  put  him  in  prison  too\nsoon,  I  may  very  likely  give  him,  so  to  speak,\nmoral support, he-he! You're laughing?'", "Raskolnikov  had  no  idea  of  laughing.  He  was\nsitting  with  compressed  lips,  his  feverish  eyes\nfixed on Porfiry Petrovitch's.\n'Yet  that  is  the  case,  with  some  types\nespecially,  for  men  are  so  different.  You  say\n'evidence'.  Well,  there  may  be  evidence.  But\nevidence, you know, can generally be taken two\nways.  I  am  an  examining  lawyer  and  a  weak\nman, I confess it. I should like to make a proof,\nso to say, mathematically clear. I should like to\nmake a chain of evidence such as twice two are\nfour, it ought to be a direct, irrefutable proof! (cid:24)(cid:24)\nAnd  if  I  shut  him  up  too  soon-even  though  I\nmight  be  convinced  he  was  the  man,  I  should\nvery likely be depriving myself of the means of\ngetting further evidence against him. And how?\nBy giving him, so to speak, a definite position, I\nshall put him out of suspense and set his mind\nat rest, so that he will retreat into his shell. They\nsay  that  at  Sevastopol,  soon  after  Alma,  the\nclever  people  were  in  a  terrible  fright  that  the\nenemy  would  attack  openly  and  take\nSevastopol at once. But when they saw that the\nenemy  preferred  a  regular  siege,  they  were\ndelighted, I am told and reassured, for the thing", "would  drag  on  for  two  months  at  least.  You're\nlaughing,  you  don't  believe  me  again?  Of\ncourse,  you're  right,  too.  You're  right,  you're\nright. These are special cases, I admit. But you\nmust  observe  this,  my  dear  Rodion\nRomanovitch,  the  general  case,  the  case  for\nwhich all legal forms and rules are intended, for\nwhich  they  are  calculated  and  laid  down  in\nbooks, does not exist at all, for the reason that\nevery  case,  every  crime,  for  instance,  so  soon\nas  it  actually  occurs,  at  once  becomes  a\nthoroughly special case and sometimes a case\nunlike any that's gone before. Very comic cases\nof that sort sometimes occur. If I leave one man\nquite alone, if I don't touch him and don't worry\nhim, but let him know or at least suspect every\nmoment  that  I  know  all  about  it  and  am\nwatching  him  day  and  night,  and  if  he  is  in\ncontinual suspicion and terror, he'll be bound to\nlose his head. He'll come of himself, or maybe\ndo  something  which  will  make  it  as  plain  as\ntwice  two  are  four-it's  delightful.  It  may  be  so\nwith a simple peasant, but with one of our sort,\nan  intelligent  man  cultivated  on  a  certain  side,\nit's a dead certainty. (cid:24)(cid:24)0 Crime and Punishment\nFor, my dear fellow, it's a very important matter\nto  know  on  what  side  a  man  is  cultivated.  And", "then  there  are  nerves,  there  are  nerves,  you\nhave  overlooked  them!  Why,  they  are  all  sick,\nnervous  and  irritable!  ...  And  then  how  they  all\nsuffer  from  spleen!  That  I  assure  you  is  a\nregular  gold-mine  for  us.  And  it's  no  anxiety  to\nme, his running about the town free! Let him, let\nhim walk about for a bit! I know well enough that\nI've  caught  him  and  that  he  won't  escape  me.\nWhere  could  he  escape  to,  he-he?  Abroad,\nperhaps?  A  Pole  will  escape  abroad,  but  not\nhere,  especially  as  I  am  watching  and  have\ntaken measures. Will he escape into the depths\nof  the  country  perhaps?  But  you  know,\npeasants  live  there,  real  rude  Russian\npeasants.  A  modern  cultivated  man  would\nprefer prison to living with such strangers as our\npeasants.  He-he!  But  that's  all  nonsense,  and\non  the  surface.  It's  not  merely  that  he  has\nnowhere to run to, he is psychologically unable\nto  escape  me,  he-he!  What  an  expression!\nThrough a law of nature he can't escape me if\nhe  had  anywhere  to  go.  Have  you  seen  a\nbutterfly  round  a  candle?  That's  how  he  will\nkeep  circling  and  circling  round  me.  Freedom\nwill lose its attractions. He'll begin to brood, he'll\nweave  a  tangle  round  himself,  he'll  worry\nhimself  to  death!  What's  more  he  will  provide", "me with a mathematical proof-if I only give him\nlong  enough  interval....  And  he'll  keep  circling\nround  me,  getting  nearer  and  nearer  and\nthen-flop! He'll fly straight into my mouth and I'll\nswallow  him,  and  that  will  be  very  amusing,\nhe-he-he! You don't believe me?'\nRaskolnikov  made  no  reply;  he  sat  pale  and\nmotionless,  still  gazing  with  the  same  intensity\ninto  Porfiry's  face.(cid:24)1  'It's  a  lesson,'  he  thought,\nturning cold. 'This is beyond the cat playing with\na  mouse,  like  yesterday.  He  can't  be  showing\noff  his  power  with  no  motive  ...  prompting  me;\nhe  is  far  too  clever  for  that  ...  he  must  have\nanother object. What is it? It's all nonsense, my\nfriend, you are pretending, to scare me! You've\nno  proofs  and  the  man  I  saw  had  no  real\nexistence. You simply want to make me lose my\nhead,  to  work  me  up  beforehand  and  so  to\ncrush  me.  But  you  are  wrong,  you  won't  do  it!\nBut  why  give  me  such  a  hint?  Is  he  reckoning\non my shattered nerves? No, my friend, you are\nwrong,  you  won't  do  it  even  though  you  have\nsome trap for me ... let us see what you have in\nstore for me.'\nAnd  he  braced  himself  to  face  a  terrible  and", "unknown  ordeal.  At  times  he  longed  to  fall  on\nPorfiry  and  strangle  him.  This  anger  was  what\nhe dreaded from the beginning. He felt that his\nparched  lips  were  flecked  with  foam,  his  heart\nwas  throbbing.  But  he  was  still  determined  not\nto  speak  till  the  right  moment.  He  realised  that\nthis was the best policy in his position, because\ninstead  of  saying  too  much  he  would  be\nirritating his enemy by his silence and provoking\nhim  into  speaking  too  freely.  Anyhow,  this  was\nwhat he hoped for.\n'No, I see you don't believe me, you think I am\nplaying  a  harmless  joke  on  you,'  Porfiry  began\nagain,  getting  more  and  more  lively,  chuckling\nat  every  instant  and  again  pacing  round  the\nroom.  'And  to  be  sure  you're  right:  God  has\ngiven  me  a  figure  that  can  awaken  none  but\ncomic  ideas  in  other  people;  a  buffoon;  but  let\nme tell you, and I repeat it, excuse an old man,\nmy dear Rodion Romanovitch, you are a (cid:24) man\nstill young, so to say, in your first youth and so\nyou put intellect above everything, like all young\npeople.

Well, I'll tell you the\nwhole  truth,  my  dear  fellow,  about  this  special\ncase  I  mean:  actual  fact  and  a  man's\ntemperament, my dear sir, are weighty matters\nand  it's  astonishing  how  they  sometimes\ndeceive  the  sharpest  calculation!

'It  will  be  sure  to  do  you\ngood.'\nPorfiry  Petrovitch's  alarm  and  sympathy  were\nso  natural  that  Raskolnikov  was  silent  and\nbegan looking at him with wild curiosity.

In  amazement  he  listened\nwith strained attention to Porfiry Petrovitch who\nstill  seemed  frightened  as  he  looked  after  him\nwith friendly solicitude. But he did not believe a\nword  he  said,  though  he  felt  a  strange\ninclination  to  believe.  Porfiry's  unexpected\nwords  about  the  flat  had  utterly  overwhelmed\nhim.  'How  can  it  be,  he  knows  about  the  flat\nthen,'  he  thought  suddenly,  'and  he  tells  it  me\nhimself!'\n'Yes,  in  our  legal  practice  there  was  a  case\nalmost  exactly  similar,  a  case  of  morbid\npsychology,'  Porfiry  went  on  quickly.  'A  man\nconfessed  to  murder  and  how  he  kept  it  up!  It\nwas a regular hallucination; he brought forward\nfacts,  he  (cid:24)(cid:24)  imposed  upon  everyone  and  why?\nHe  had  been  partly,  but  only  partly,\nunintentionally the cause of a murder and when\nhe  knew  that  he  had  given  the  murderers  the\nopportunity, he sank into dejection, it got on his\nmind and turned his brain, he began imagining\nthings  and  he  persuaded  himself  that  he  was\nthe  murderer.  But  at  last  the  High  Court  of\nAppeal  went  into  it  and  the  poor  fellow  was", "acquitted and put under proper care. Thanks to\nthe  Court  of  Appeal!  Tuttut-tut!

I've studied all this morbid psychology in\nmy  practice.  A  man  is  sometimes  tempted  to\njump out of a window or from a belfry. Just the\nsame  with  bell-ringing....  It's  all  illness,  Rodion\nRomanovitch!  You  have  begun  to  neglect  your\nillness.  You  should  consult  an  experienced\ndoctor,  what's  the  good  of  that  fat  fellow?

He can't be, he can't\nbe.'  He  rejected  that  idea,  feeling  to  what  a\ndegree  of  fury  it  might  drive  him,  feeling  that\nthat fury might drive him mad.\n'I was not delirious. I knew what I was doing,' he\ncried,  straining  every  faculty  to  penetrate\nPorfiry's  game,  'I  was  quite  myself,  do  you", "hear?'\n'Yes, I hear and understand. You said yesterday\nyou  were  not  delirious,  you  were  particularly\nemphatic  about  it!  I  understand  all  you  can  tell\nme! A-ach! ... Listen, Ro(cid:24) dion Romanovitch, my\ndear  fellow.  If  you  were  actually  a  criminal,  or\nwere  somehow  mixed  up  in  this  damnable\nbusiness,  would  you  insist  that  you  were  not\ndelirious but in full possession of your faculties?\nAnd so emphatically and persistently? Would it\nbe possible? Quite impossible, to my thinking. If\nyou  had  anything  on  your  conscience,  you\ncertainly ought to insist that you were delirious.\nThat's so, isn't it?'\nThere  was  a  note  of  slyness  in  this  inquiry.\nRaskolnikov  drew  back  on  the  sofa  as  Porfiry\nbent over him and stared in silent perplexity at\nhim.\n'Another  thing  about  Razumihin-you  certainly\nought  to  have  said  that  he  came  of  his  own\naccord,  to  have  concealed  your  part  in  it!  But\nyou  don't  conceal  it!  You  lay  stress  on  his\ncoming at your instigation.'", "Raskolnikov had not done so. A chill went down\nhis back.\n'You  keep  telling  lies,'  he  said  slowly  and\nweakly, twisting his lips into a sickly smile, 'you\nare  trying  again  to  show  that  you  know  all  my\ngame, that you know all I shall say beforehand,'\nhe  said,  conscious  himself  that  he  was  not\nweighing  his  words  as  he  ought.  'You  want  to\nfrighten me ... or you are simply laughing at me\n...'\nHe still stared at him as he said this and again\nthere was a light of intense hatred in his eyes.\n'You  keep  lying,'  he  said.  'You  know  perfectly\nwell that the best policy for the criminal is to tell\nthe truth as nearly as possible ... to conceal as\nlittle  as  possible.  I  don't  believe  you!'(cid:24)(cid:24)  'What  a\nwily person you are!' Porfiry tittered, 'there's no\ncatching  you;  you've  a  perfect  monomania.  So\nyou  don't  believe  me?  But  still  you  do  believe\nme,  you  believe  a  quarter;  I'll  soon  make  you\nbelieve  the  whole,  because  I  have  a  sincere\nliking for you and genuinely wish you good.'\nRaskolnikov's lips trembled.", "'Yes,  I  do,'  went  on  Porfiry,  touching\nRaskolnikov's arm genially, 'you must take care\nof your illness. Besides, your mother and sister\nare here now; you must think of them. You must\nsoothe  and  comfort  them  and  you  do  nothing\nbut frighten them ...'\n'What  has  that  to  do  with  you?  How  do  you\nknow  it?  What  concern  is  it  of  yours?  You  are\nkeeping watch on me and want to let me know\nit?'\n'Good  heavens!  Why,  I  learnt  it  all  from  you\nyourself!  You  don't  notice  that  in  your\nexcitement  you  tell  me  and  others  everything.\nFrom  Razumihin,  too,  I  learnt  a  number  of\ninteresting  details  yesterday.  No,  you\ninterrupted  me,  but  I  must  tell  you  that,  for  all\nyour  wit,  your  suspiciousness  makes  you  lose\nthe common-sense view of things. To return to\nbell-ringing,  for  instance.

Why,  if  I  had  the  slightest\nsuspicion of you, should I have acted like that?\nNo, I should first have disarmed your suspicions", "and  not  let  you  see  I  knew  of  that  fact,  should\nhave diverted your attention and suddenly have\ndealt you a knock-down blow (your expression)\nsaying: 'And what were you doing, sir, pray, at\nten  or  nearly  eleven  at  the  murdered  woman's\nflat and why (cid:24)(cid:24)0 Crime and Punishment did you\nring the bell and why did you ask about blood?\nAnd  why  did  you  invite  the  porters  to  go  with\nyou  to  the  police  station,  to  the  lieutenant?'\nThat's how I ought to have acted if I had a grain\nof suspicion of you. I ought to have taken your\nevidence  in  due  form,  searched  your  lodging\nand perhaps have arrested you, too ... so I have\nno suspicion of you, since I have not done that!\nBut  you  can't  look  at  it  normally  and  you  see\nnothing, I say again.'\nRaskolnikov  started  so  that  Porfiry  Petrovitch\ncould not fail to perceive it.\n'You  are  lying  all  the  while,'  he  cried,  'I  don't\nknow your object, but you are lying. You did not\nspeak  like  that  just  now  and  I  cannot  be\nmistaken!'\n'I  am  lying?'  Porfiry  repeated,  apparently\nincensed, but preserving a good-humoured and", "ironical face, as though he were not in the least\nconcerned at \nRaskolnikov's opinion of him. 'I am lying ... but\nhow  did  I  treat  you  just  now,  I,  the  examining\nlawyer?  Prompting  you  and  giving  you  every\nmeans for your defence; illness, I said, delirium,\ninjury, melancholy and the police officers and all\nthe rest of it? Ah! He-he-he! Though, indeed, all\nthose  psychological  means  of  defence  are  not\nvery  reliable  and  cut  both  ways:  illness,\ndelirium,  I  don't  remember-that's  all  right,  but\nwhy,  my  good  sir,  in  your  illness  and  in  your\ndelirium  were  you  haunted  by  just  those\ndelusions  and  not  by  any  others?  There  may\nhave been others, eh? He-he-he!'\nRaskolnikov  looked  haughtily  and\ncontemptuously at him.\n'Briefly,' he said loudly and imperiously, rising to\nhis feet (cid:24)1 and in so doing pushing Porfiry back\na  little,  'briefly,  I  want  to  know,  do  you\nacknowledge  me  perfectly  free  from  suspicion\nor not? Tell me, Porfiry Petrovitch, tell me once\nfor all and make haste!'", "'What  a  business  I'm  having  with  you!'  cried\nPorfiry with a perfectly good-humoured, sly and\ncomposed face. 'And why do you want to know,\nwhy do you want to know so much, since they\nhaven't begun to worry you? Why, you are like a\nchild  asking  for  matches!  And  why  are  you  so\nuneasy?  Why  do  you  force  yourself  upon  us,\neh? He-he-he!'\n'I  repeat,'  Raskolnikov  cried  furiously,  'that  I\ncan't put up with it!'\n'With what? Uncertainty?' interrupted Porfiry.\n'Don't jeer at me! I won't have it! I tell you I won't\nhave it. I can't and I won't, do you hear, do you\nhear?' he shouted, bringing his fist down on the\ntable again.\n'Hush!  Hush!  They'll  overhear!  I  warn  you\nseriously, take care of yourself. I am not joking,'\nPorfiry  whispered,  but  this  time  there  was  not\nthe  look  of  old  womanish  good  nature  and\nalarm  in  his  face.  Now  he  was  peremptory,\nstern,  frowning  and  for  once  laying  aside  all\nmystification.", "But  this  was  only  for  an  instant.  Raskolnikov,\nbewildered, suddenly fell into actual frenzy, but,\nstrange to say, he again obeyed the command\nto  speak  quietly,  though  he  was  in  a  perfect\nparoxysm of fury.\n'I  will  not  allow  myself  to  be  tortured,'  he\nwhispered, instantly recognising with hatred that\nhe  could  not  help  obeying  the  command  and\ndriven  to  even  greater  fury  by  the  thought.\n'Arrest  me,  search  me,  but  kindly  act  in  due  (cid:24)\nform and don't play with me! Don't dare!'\n'Don't worry about the form,' Porfiry interrupted\nwith the same sly smile, as it were, gloating with\nenjoyment over \nRaskolnikov. 'I invited you to see me quite in a\nfriendly way.'\n'I don't want your friendship and I spit on it! Do\nyou  hear?  And,  here,  I  take  my  cap  and  go.\nWhat  will  you  say  now  if  you  mean  to  arrest\nme?'\nHe took up his cap and went to the door.", "'And won't you see my little surprise?' chuckled\nPorfiry,  again  taking  him  by  the  arm  and\nstopping him at the door.\nHe  seemed  to  become  more  playful  and\ngood-humoured which maddened Raskolnikov.\n'What  surprise?'  he  asked,  standing  still  and\nlooking at Porfiry in alarm.\n'My  little  surprise,  it's  sitting  there  behind  the\ndoor, hehe-he!' (He pointed to the locked door.)\n'I locked him in that he should not escape.'\n'What is it? Where? What? ...'\nRaskolnikov walked to the door and would have\nopened it, but it was locked.\n'It's locked, here is the key!'\nAnd he brought a key out of his pocket.\n'You  are  lying,'  roared  Raskolnikov  without\nrestraint, 'you lie, you damned punchinello!' and\nhe rushed at Porfiry who retreated to the other\ndoor, not at all alarmed.", "'I  understand  it  all!  You  are  lying  and  mocking\nso that I may betray myself to you ...'\n'Why, you could not betray yourself any further,\nmy  dear  (cid:24)(cid:24)  Rodion  Romanovitch.  You  are  in  a\npassion. Don't shout, I shall call the clerks.'\n'You are lying! Call the clerks! You knew I was\nill and tried to work me into a frenzy to make me\nbetray  myself,  that  was  your  object!  Produce\nyour  facts!  I  understand  it  all.  You've  no\nevidence,  you  have  only  wretched  rubbishly\nsuspicions  like  Zametov's!  You  knew  my\ncharacter,  you  wanted  to  drive  me  to  fury  and\nthen  to  knock  me  down  with  priests  and\ndeputies.... Are you waiting for them? eh! What\nare  you  waiting  for?  Where  are  they?  Produce\nthem?'\n'Why  deputies,  my  good  man?  What  things\npeople will imagine! And to do so would not be\nacting  in  form  as  you  say,  you  don't  know  the\nbusiness,  my  dear  fellow....  And  there's  no\nescaping  form,  as  you  see,'  Porfiry  muttered,\nlistening  at  the  door  through  which  a  noise\ncould be heard.", "'Ah, they're coming,' cried Raskolnikov. 'You've\nsent  for  them!  You  expected  them!  Well,\nproduce  them  all:  your  deputies,  your\nwitnesses, what you like! ... I am ready!'\nBut at this moment a strange incident occurred,\nsomething  so  unexpected  that  neither\nRaskolnikov  nor  Porfiry  Petrovitch  could  have\nlooked for such a conclusion to their interview.(cid:24) ", "#$#$Chapter 29#$#$\nWhen  he  remembered  the  scene  afterwards,\nthis is how \nRaskolnikov saw it.\nThe  noise  behind  the  door  increased,  and\nsuddenly the door was opened a little.\n'What  is  it?'  cried  Porfiry  Petrovitch,  annoyed.\n'Why, I gave orders ...'\nFor an instant there was no answer, but it was\nevident  that  there  were  several  persons  at  the\ndoor,  and  that  they  were  apparently  pushing\nsomebody back.\n'What  is  it?'  Porfiry  Petrovitch  repeated,\nuneasily.\n'The  prisoner  Nikolay  has  been  brought,'\nsomeone answered.\n'He is not wanted! Take him away! Let him wait!", "What's  he  doing  here?  How  irregular!'  cried\nPorfiry, rushing to the door.\n'But he ...' began the same voice, and suddenly\nceased.\nTwo  seconds,  not  more,  were  spent  in  actual\nstruggle,  then  someone  gave  a  violent  shove,\nand then a man, very pale, strode into the room.\nThis  man's  appearance  was  at  first  sight  very\nstrange.  He  stared  straight  before  him,  as\nthough seeing nothing. There was a determined\ngleam in his eyes; at the same time there was a\ndeathly  pallor  in  his  face,  as  though  he  were\nbeing  led  to  the  scaffold.  His  white  lips  were\nfaintly  twitching.(cid:24)(cid:24)  He  was  dressed  like  a\nworkman  and  was  of  medium  height,  very\nyoung, slim, his hair cut in round crop, with thin\nspare  features.  The  man  whom  he  had  thrust\nback followed him into the room and succeeded\nin  seizing  him  by  the  shoulder;  he  was  a\nwarder; but Nikolay pulled his arm away.\nSeveral  persons  crowded  inquisitively  into  the\ndoorway.  Some  of  them  tried  to  get  in.  All  this\ntook place almost instantaneously.", "'Go away, it's too soon! Wait till you are sent for!\n... Why have you brought him so soon?' Porfiry\nPetrovitch muttered, extremely annoyed, and as\nit were thrown out of his reckoning.\nBut Nikolay suddenly knelt down.\n'What's the matter?' cried Porfiry, surprised.\n'I am guilty! Mine is the sin! I am the murderer,'\nNikolay  articulated  suddenly,  rather  breathless,\nbut speaking fairly loudly.\nFor ten seconds there was silence as though all\nhad  been  struck  dumb;  even  the  warder\nstepped  back,  mechanically  retreated  to  the\ndoor, and stood immovable.\n'What is it?' cried Porfiry Petrovitch, recovering\nfrom his momentary stupefaction.\n'I ... am the murderer,' repeated Nikolay, after a\nbrief pause.\n'What  ...  you  ...  what  ...  whom  did  you  kill?'\nPorfiry Petrovitch was obviously bewildered.", "Nikolay again was silent for a moment.\n'Alyona  Ivanovna  and  her  sister  Lizaveta\nIvanovna, I ... (cid:24) killed ... with an axe. Darkness\ncame  over  me,'  he  added  suddenly,  and  was\nagain silent.\nHe  still  remained  on  his  knees.  Porfiry\nPetrovitch  stood  for  some  moments  as  though\nmeditating,  but  suddenly  roused  himself  and\nwaved  back  the  uninvited  spectators.  They\ninstantly vanished and closed the door. Then he\nlooked towards Raskolnikov, who was standing\nin  the  corner,  staring  wildly  at  Nikolay  and\nmoved  towards  him,  but  stopped  short,  looked\nfrom  Nikolay  to  Raskolnikov  and  then  again  at\nNikolay, and seeming unable to restrain himself\ndarted at the latter.\n'You're in too great a hurry,' he shouted at him,\nalmost angrily. 'I didn't ask you what came over\nyou.... Speak, did you kill them?'\n'I  am  the  murderer....  I  want  to  give  evidence,'\nNikolay pronounced.", "'Ach! What did you kill them with?'\n'An axe. I had it ready.'\n'Ach, he is in a hurry! Alone?'\nNikolay did not understand the question.\n'Did you do it alone?'\n'Yes, alone. And Mitka is not guilty and had no\nshare in it.'\n'Don't  be  in  a  hurry  about  Mitka!  A-ach!  How\nwas it you ran downstairs like that at the time?\nThe porters met you both!'\n'It  was  to  put  them  off  the  scent  ...  I  ran  after\nMitka,' \nNikolay  replied  hurriedly,  as  though  he  had\nprepared the answer.(cid:24)(cid:24) 'I knew it!' cried Porfiry,\nwith vexation. 'It's not his own tale he is telling,'\nhe muttered as though to himself, and suddenly\nhis eyes rested on Raskolnikov again.\nHe was apparently so taken up with Nikolay that", "for a moment he had forgotten Raskolnikov. He\nwas a little taken aback.\n'My dear Rodion Romanovitch, excuse me!' he\nflew  up  to  him,  'this  won't  do;  I'm  afraid  you\nmust go ... it's no good your staying ... I will ...\nyou see, what a surprise! ... Goodbye!'\nAnd  taking  him  by  the  arm,  he  showed  him  to\nthe door.\n'I  suppose  you  didn't  expect  it?'  said\nRaskolnikov  who,  though  he  had  not  yet  fully\ngrasped  the  situation,  had  regained  his\ncourage.\n'You did not expect it either, my friend. See how\nyour hand is trembling! He-he!'\n'You're trembling, too, Porfiry Petrovitch!'\n'Yes, I am; I didn't expect it.'\nThey  were  already  at  the  door;  Porfiry  was\nimpatient for Raskolnikov to be gone.\n'And  your  little  surprise,  aren't  you  going  to", "show it to me?' Raskolnikov said, sarcastically.\n'Why,  his  teeth  are  chattering  as  he  asks,\nhe-he! You are an ironical person! Come, till we\nmeet!'\n'I believe we can say good-bye!'\n'That's  in  God's  hands,'  muttered  Porfiry,  with\nan unnatural smile.\nAs  he  walked  through  the  office,  Raskolnikov\nnoticed  that  many  people  were  looking  at  him.\nAmong them he saw (cid:24) the two porters from the\nhouse,  whom  he  had  invited  that  night  to  the\npolice station. They stood there waiting. But he\nwas no sooner on the stairs than he heard the\nvoice  of  Porfiry  Petrovitch  behind  him.  Turning\nround, he saw the latter running after him, out of\nbreath.\n'One  word,  Rodion  Romanovitch;  as  to  all  the\nrest, it's in God's hands, but as a matter of form\nthere  are  some  questions  I  shall  have  to  ask\nyou ... so we shall meet again, shan't we?'\nAnd Porfiry stood still, facing him with a smile.", "'Shan't we?' he added again.\nHe seemed to want to say something more, but\ncould not speak out.\n'You  must  forgive  me,  Porfiry  Petrovitch,  for\nwhat  has  just  passed  ...  I  lost  my  temper,'\nbegan Raskolnikov, who had so far regained his\ncourage  that  he  felt  irresistibly  inclined  to\ndisplay his coolness.\n'Don't  mention  it,  don't  mention  it,'  Porfiry\nreplied, almost gleefully. 'I myself, too ... I have\na  wicked  temper,  I  admit  it!  But  we  shall  meet\nagain. If it's God's will, we may see a great deal\nof one another.'\n'And  will  get  to  know  each  other  through  and\nthrough?' added Raskolnikov.\n'Yes;  know  each  other  through  and  through,'\nassented Porfiry Petrovitch, and he screwed up\nhis eyes, looking earnestly at Raskolnikov. 'Now\nyou're going to a birthday party?'\n'To a funeral.'", "'Of  course,  the  funeral!  Take  care  of  yourself,\nand get (cid:24)(cid:24) well.'\n'I  don't  know  what  to  wish  you,'  said\nRaskolnikov,  who  had  begun  to  descend  the\nstairs,  but  looked  back  again.  'I  should  like  to\nwish  you  success,  but  your  office  is  such  a\ncomical one.'\n'Why comical?' Porfiry Petrovitch had turned to\ngo, but he seemed to prick up his ears at this.\n'Why,  how  you  must  have  been  torturing  and\nharassing  that  poor  Nikolay  psychologically,\nafter  your  fashion,  till  he  confessed!  You  must\nhave been at him day and night, proving to him\nthat he was the murderer, and now that he has\nconfessed,  you'll  begin  vivisecting  him  again.\n'You  are  lying,'  you'll  say.  'You  are  not  the\nmurderer!  You  can't  be!  It's  not  your  own  tale\nyou  are  telling!'  You  must  admit  it's  a  comical\nbusiness!'\n'He-he-he!  You  noticed  then  that  I  said  to\nNikolay just now that it was not his own tale he\nwas telling?'", "'How could I help noticing it!'\n'He-he!  You  are  quick-witted.  You  notice\neverything!  You've  really  a  playful  mind!  And\nyou  always  fasten  on  the  comic  side  ...  he-he!\nThey say that was the marked characteristic of\nGogol, among the writers.'\n'Yes, of Gogol.'\n'Yes, of Gogol.... I shall look forward to meeting\nyou.'\n'So shall I.'\nRaskolnikov  walked  straight  home.  He  was  so\nmuddled  and  bewildered  that  on  getting  home\nhe  sat  for  a  quarter  of  an  hour  on  the  sofa,\ntrying to collect his thoughts. He did not attempt\nto think about Nikolay; he was stupefied; he (cid:24)00\nCrime  and  Punishment  felt  that  his  confession\nwas  something  inexplicable,\namazing-something  beyond  his  understanding.\nBut  Nikolay's  confession  was  an  actual  fact.\nThe consequences of this fact were clear to him\nat  once,  its  falsehood  could  not  fail  to  be", "discovered,  and  then  they  would  be  after  him\nagain. Till then, at least, he was free and must\ndo  something  for  himself,  for  the  danger  was\nimminent.\nBut  how  imminent?  His  position  gradually\nbecame  clear  to  him.  Remembering,  sketchily,\nthe  main  outlines  of  his  recent  scene  with\nPorfiry, he could not help shuddering again with\nhorror.  Of  course,  he  did  not  yet  know  all\nPorfiry's  aims,  he  could  not  see  into  all  his\ncalculations.  But  he  had  already  partly  shown\nhis  hand,  and  no  one  knew  better  than\nRaskolnikov  how  terrible  Porfiry's  'lead'  had\nbeen  for  him.  A  little  more  and  he  might  have\ngiven himself away completely, circumstantially.\nKnowing his nervous temperament and from the\nfirst glance seeing through him, Porfiry, though\nplaying a bold game, was bound to win. There's\nno denying that Raskolnikov had compromised\nhimself seriously, but no facts had come to light\nas  yet;  there  was  nothing  positive.  But  was  he\ntaking  a  true  view  of  the  position?  Wasn't  he\nmistaken?  What  had  Porfiry  been  trying  to  get\nat?  Had  he  really  some  surprise  prepared  for\nhim?  And  what  was  it?  Had  he  really  been\nexpecting  something  or  not?  How  would  they", "have  parted  if  it  had  not  been  for  the\nunexpected appearance of Nikolay?\nPorfiry  had  shown  almost  all  his  cards-of\ncourse,  he  had  risked  something  in  showing\nthem-and  if  he  had  really  had  anything  up  his\nsleeve  (Raskolnikov  reflected),  he  01  would\nhave shown that, too. What was that 'surprise'?\nWas it a joke? Had it meant anything? Could it\nhave concealed anything like a fact, a piece of\npositive evidence? His yesterday's visitor? What\nhad  become  of  him?  Where  was  he  to-day?  If\nPorfiry  really  had  any  evidence,  it  must  be\nconnected with him....\nHe sat on the sofa with his elbows on his knees\nand  his  face  hidden  in  his  hands.  He  was  still\nshivering  nervously.  At  last  he  got  up,  took  his\ncap, thought a minute, and went to the door.\nHe had a sort of presentiment that for to-day, at\nleast,  he  might  consider  himself  out  of  danger.\nHe  had  a  sudden  sense  almost  of  joy;  he\nwanted  to  make  haste  to  Katerina  Ivanovna's.\nHe would be too late for the funeral, of course,\nbut he would be in time for the memorial dinner,\nand there at once he would see Sonia.", "He  stood  still,  thought  a  moment,  and  a\nsuffering  smile  came  for  a  moment  on  to  his\nlips.\n'To-day!  To-day,'  he  repeated  to  himself.  'Yes,\nto-day! So it must be....'\nBut as he was about to open the door, it began\nopening  of  itself.  He  started  and  moved  back.\nThe  door  opened  gently  and  slowly,  and  there\nsuddenly  appeared  a  figure-yesterday's  visitor\nfrom underground.\nThe  man  stood  in  the  doorway,  looked  at\nRaskolnikov  without  speaking,  and  took  a  step\nforward into the room. He was exactly the same\nas yesterday; the same figure, the same dress,\nbut  there  was  a  great  change  in  his  face;  he\nlooked  dejected  and  sighed  deeply.  If  he  had\nonly put his (cid:24)0(cid:24) Crime and Punishment hand up\nto  his  cheek  and  leaned  his  head  on  one  side\nhe  would  have  looked  exactly  like  a  peasant\nwoman.\n'What do you want?' asked Raskolnikov, numb\nwith  terror.  The  man  was  still  silent,  but", "suddenly he bowed down almost to the ground,\ntouching it with his finger.\n'What is it?' cried Raskolnikov.\n'I have sinned,' the man articulated softly.'How?'\n'By evil thoughts.'\nThey looked at one another.\n'I was vexed. When you came, perhaps in drink,\nand  bade  the  porters  go  to  the  police  station\nand  asked  about  the  blood,  I  was  vexed  that\nthey let you go and took you for drunken. I was\nso vexed that I lost my sleep. And remembering\nthe address we came here yesterday and asked\nfor you....'\n'Who  came?'  Raskolnikov  interrupted,  instantly\nbeginning to recollect.\n'I did, I've wronged you.'\n'Then you come from that house?'\n'I  was  standing  at  the  gate  with  them  ...  don't", "you remember? We have carried on our trade in\nthat house for years past. We cure and prepare\nhides, we take work home ... most of all I was\nvexed....'\nAnd  the  whole  scene  of  the  day  before\nyesterday  in  the  gateway  came  clearly  before\nRaskolnikov's  mind;  he  recollected  that  there\nhad  been  several  people  there  besides  the\nporters,  women  among  them.  He  remembered\none voice had suggested taking him straight to\nthe  police-  station.  He  0(cid:24)  could  not  recall  the\nface  of  the  speaker,  and  even  now  he  did  not\nrecognise  it,  but  he  remembered  that  he  had\nturned round and made him some answer....\nSo  this  was  the  solution  of  yesterday's  horror.\nThe  most  awful  thought  was  that  he  had  been\nactually almost lost, had almost done for himself\non  account  of  such  a  trivial  circumstance.  So\nthis  man  could  tell  nothing  except  his  asking\nabout  the  flat  and  the  blood  stains.  So  Porfiry,\ntoo,  had  nothing  but  that  delirium  no  facts  but\nthis  psychology  which  cuts  both  ways  nothing\npositive. So if no more facts come to light (and\nthey must not, they must not!) then ... then what\ncan they do to him? How can they convict him,", "even  if  they  arrest  him?  And  Porfiry  then  had\nonly just heard about the flat and had not known\nabout it before.\n'Was  it  you  who  told  Porfiry  ...  that  I'd  been\nthere?' he cried, struck by a sudden idea.\n'What Porfiry?'\n'The head of the detective department?'\n'Yes.  The  porters  did  not  go  there,  but  I\nwent.''To-day?'\n'I got there two minutes before you. And I heard,\nI heard it all, how he worried you.'\n'Where? What? When?'\n'Why, in the next room. I was sitting there all the\ntime.'\n'What?  Why,  then  you  were  the  surprise?  But\nhow could it happen? Upon my word!'\n'I saw that the porters did not want to do what I\nsaid,' began the man; 'for it's too late, said they,", "and maybe he'll be angry that we did not come\nat  the  time.  I  was  vexed  and  I  (cid:24)0(cid:24)  Crime  and\nPunishment lost my sleep, and I began making\ninquiries.  And  finding  out  yesterday  where  to\ngo, I went to-day. The first time I went he wasn't\nthere,  when  I  came  an  hour  later  he  couldn't\nsee me. I went the third time, and they showed\nme  in.  I  informed  him  of  everything,  just  as  it\nhappened,  and  he  began  skipping  about  the\nroom and punching himself on the chest. 'What\ndo  you  scoundrels  mean  by  it?  If  I'd  known\nabout  it  I  should  have  arrested  him!'  Then  he\nran  out,  called  somebody  and  began  talking  to\nhim  in  the  corner,  then  he  turned  to  me,\nscolding and questioning me. He scolded me a\ngreat deal; and I told him everything, and I told\nhim that you didn't dare to say a word in answer\nto  me  yesterday  and  that  you  didn't  recognise\nme. And he fell to running about again and kept\nhitting  himself  on  the  chest,  and  getting  angry\nand  running  about,  and  when  you  were\nannounced he told me to go into the next room.\n'Sit there a bit,' he said. 'Don't move, whatever\nyou may hear.' And he set a chair there for me\nand locked me in. 'Perhaps,' he said, 'I may call\nyou.'

His\nmalice  was  aimed  at  himself;  with  shame  and", "contempt  he  recollected  his  'cowardice.'(cid:24)0(cid:24)\nCrime and Punishment ", "#$#$Chapter 30#$#$\n0(cid:24) ", "#$#$Chapter 31#$#$\nThe  morning  that  followed  the  fateful  interview\nwith  Dounia    and    her    mother    brought \nsobering  influences to bear on Pyotr Petrovitch.\nIntensely  unpleasant  as  it  was,  he  was  forced\nlittle  by  little  to  accept  as  a  fact  beyond  recall\nwhat  had  seemed  to  him  only  the  day  before\nfantastic  and  incredible.  The  black  snake  of\nwounded vanity had been gnawing at his heart\nall  night.  When  he  got  out  of  bed,  Pyotr\nPetrovitch  immediately  looked  in  the\nlooking-glass.  He  was  afraid  that  he  had\njaundice.  However  his  health  seemed\nunimpaired  so  far,  and  looking  at  his  noble,\nclear-skinned  countenance  which  had  grown\nfattish  of  late,  Pyotr  Petrovitch  for  an  instant\nwas  positively  comforted  in  the  conviction  that\nhe would find another bride and, perhaps, even\na  better  one.  But  coming  back  to  the  sense  of\nhis  present  position,  he  turned  aside  and  spat\nvigorously,  which  excited  a  sarcastic  smile  in\nAndrey Semyonovitch Lebeziatnikov, the young\nfriend  with  whom  he  was  staying.  That  smile\nPyotr  Petrovitch  noticed,  and  at  once  set  it", "down  against  his  young  friend's  account.  He\nhad  set  down  a  good  many  points  against  him\nof  late.  His  anger  was  redoubled  when  he\nreflected that he ought not to have told Andrey\nSemyonovitch  about  the  result  of  yesterday's\ninterview. That was the second mistake he had\nmade  in  temper,  through  impulsiveness  and\nirritability....  Moreover,  all  that  (cid:24)0(cid:24)  Crime  and\nPunishment  morning  one  unpleasantness\nfollowed  another.  He  even  found  a  hitch\nawaiting him in his legal case in the senate. He\nwas particularly irritated by the owner of the flat\nwhich  had  been  taken  in  view  of  his\napproaching  marriage  and  was  being\nredecorated  at  his  own  expense;  the  owner,  a\nrich German tradesman, would not entertain the\nidea  of  breaking  the  contract  which  had  just\nbeen  signed  and  insisted  on  the  full  forfeit\nmoney, though Pyotr Petrovitch would be giving\nhim back the flat practically redecorated. In the\nsame  way  the  upholsterers  refused  to  return  a\nsingle  rouble  of  the  instalment  paid  for  the\nfurniture purchased but not yet removed to the\nflat.\n'Am  I  to  get  married  simply  for  the  sake  of  the\nfurniture?' Pyotr Petrovitch ground his teeth and", "at the same time once more he had a gleam of\ndesperate  hope.  'Can  all  that  be  really  so\nirrevocably  over?  Is  it  no  use  to  make  another\neffort?' The thought of Dounia sent a voluptuous\npang through his heart. He endured anguish at\nthat moment, and if it had been possible to slay\nRaskolnikov  instantly  by  wishing  it,  Pyotr\nPetrovitch  would  promptly  have  uttered  the\nwish.\n'It was my mistake, too, not to have given them\nmoney,'  he  thought,  as  he  returned  dejectedly\nto Lebeziatnikov's room, 'and why on earth was\nI such a Jew? It was false economy! I meant to\nkeep them without a penny so that they should\nturn  to  me  as  their  providence,  and  look  at\nthem!  foo!  If  I'd  spent  some  fifteen  hundred\nroubles on them for the trousseau and presents,\non  knick-knacks,  dressing-cases,  jewellery,\nmaterials, and all that sort of trash from Knopp's\nand  the  English  shop,  my  position  would  have\nbeen  better  0(cid:24)  and  ...  stronger!  They  could  not\nhave refused me so easily! They are the sort of\npeople  that  would  feel  bound  to  return  money\nand presents if they broke it off; and they would\nfind it hard to do it! And their conscience would\nprick them: how can we dismiss a man who has", "hitherto been so generous and delicate?.... H'm!\nI've made a blunder.'\nAnd  grinding  his  teeth  again,  Pyotr  Petrovitch\ncalled himself a fool- but not aloud, of course.\nHe returned home, twice as irritated and angry\nas  before.  The  preparations  for  the  funeral\ndinner  at  Katerina  Ivanovna's  excited  his\ncuriosity  as  he  passed.  He  had  heard  about  it\nthe day before; he fancied, indeed, that he had\nbeen invited, but absorbed in his own cares he\nhad  paid  no  attention.  Inquiring  of  Madame\nLippevechsel  who  was  busy  laying  the  table\nwhile  Katerina  Ivanovna  was  away  at  the\ncemetery, he heard that the entertainment was\nto be a great affair, that all the lodgers had been\ninvited, among them some who had not known\nthe dead man, that even Andrey Semyonovitch\nLebeziatnikov  was  invited  in  spite  of  his\nprevious  quarrel  with  Katerina  Ivanovna,  that\nhe,  Pyotr  Petrovitch,  was  not  only  invited,  but\nwas  eagerly  expected  as  he  was  the  most\nimportant  of  the  lodgers.  Amalia  Ivanovna\nherself had been invited with great ceremony in\nspite of the recent unpleasantness, and so she\nwas very busy with preparations and was taking", "a positive pleasure in them; she was moreover\ndressed  up  to  the  nines,  all  in  new  black  silk,\nand  she  was  proud  of  it.  All  this  suggested  an\nidea  to  Pyotr  Petrovitch  and  he  went  into  his\nroom,  or  rather  Lebeziatnikov's,  somewhat\nthoughtful. He had learnt that Raskolnikov was\nto  be  (cid:24)10  Crime  and  Punishment  one  of  the\nguests.\nAndrey Semyonovitch had been at home all the\nmorning. The attitude of Pyotr Petrovitch to this\ngentleman  was  strange,  though  perhaps\nnatural.  Pyotr  Petrovitch  had  despised  and\nhated  him  from  the  day  he  came  to  stay  with\nhim and at the same time he seemed somewhat\nafraid of him. He had not come to stay with him\non  his  arrival  in  Petersburg  simply  from\nparsimony,  though  that  had  been  perhaps  his\nchief  object.  He  had  heard  of  Andrey\nSemyonovitch, who had once been his ward, as\na leading young progressive who was taking an\nimportant  part  in  certain  interesting  circles,  the\ndoings of which were a legend in the provinces.\nIt  had  impressed  Pyotr  Petrovitch.  These\npowerful  omniscient  circles  who  despised\neveryone  and  showed  everyone  up  had  long\ninspired in him a peculiar but quite vague alarm.", "He had not, of course, been able to form even\nan approximate notion of what they meant. He,\nlike  everyone,  had  heard  that  there  were,\nespecially  in  Petersburg,  progressives  of  some\nsort, nihilists and so on, and, like many people,\nhe exaggerated and distorted the significance of\nthose  words  to  an  absurd  degree.  What  for\nmany  years  past  he  had  feared  more  than\nanything was being shown up and this was the\nchief ground for his continual uneasiness at the\nthought  of  transferring  his  business  to\nPetersburg.  He  was  afraid  of  this  as  little\nchildren  are  sometimes  panic-stricken.  Some\nyears before, when he was just entering on his\nown  career,  he  had  come  upon  two  cases  in\nwhich  rather  important  personages  in  the\nprovince,  patrons  of  his,  had  been  cruelly\nshown  up.  One  instance  had  ended  in  great\nscandal  for  the  11  person  attacked  and  the\nother had very nearly ended in serious trouble.\nFor this reason Pyotr Petrovitch intended to go\ninto  the  subject  as  soon  as  he  reached\nPetersburg  and,  if  necessary,  to  anticipate\ncontingencies  by  seeking  the  favour  of  'our\nyounger  generation.'  He  relied  on  Andrey\nSemyonovitch  for  this  and  before  his  visit  to\nRaskolnikov  he  had  succeeded  in  picking  up", "some current phrases. He soon discovered that\nAndrey  Semyonovitch  was  a  commonplace\nsimpleton,  but  that  by  no  means  reassured\nPyotr  Petrovitch.  Even  if  he  had  been  certain\nthat  all  the  progressives  were  fools  like  him,  it\nwould  not  have  allayed  his  uneasiness.  All  the\ndoctrines,  the  ideas,  the  systems,  with  which\nAndrey  Semyonovitch  pestered  him  had  no\ninterest  for  him.  He  had  his  own  object-he\nsimply  wanted  to  find  out  at  once  what  was\nhappening  here.  Had  these  people  any  power\nor  not?  Had  he  anything  to  fear  from  them?\nWould  they  expose  any  enterprise  of  his?  And\nwhat  precisely  was  now  the  object  of  their\nattacks?  Could  he  somehow  make  up  to  them\nand  get  round  them  if  they  really  were\npowerful?  Was  this  the  thing  to  do  or  not?\nCouldn't  he  gain  something  through  them?  In\nfact  hundreds  of  questions  presented\nthemselves.\nAndrey  Semyonovitch  was  an  anæmic,\nscrofulous  little  man,  with  strangely  flaxen\nmutton-chop  whiskers  of  which  he  was  very\nproud.  He  was  a  clerk  and  had  almost  always\nsomething  wrong  with  his  eyes.  He  was  rather\nsoft-hearted,  but  self-confident  and  sometimes", "extremely  conceited  in  speech,  which  had  an\nabsurd  effect,  incongruous  with  his  little  figure.\nHe  was  one  of  the  lodgers  most  respected  by\nAmalia  Ivanovna,  for  he  did  not  get  drunk  and\npaid reg(cid:24)1(cid:24) Crime and Punishment ularly for his\nlodgings.  Andrey  Semyonovitch  really  was\nrather stupid; he attached himself to the cause\nof  progress  and  'our  younger  generation'  from\nenthusiasm.  He  was  one  of  the  numerous  and\nvaried  legion  of  dullards,  of  half-animate\nabortions,  conceited,  half-educated  coxcombs,\nwho  attach  themselves  to  the  idea  most  in\nfashion  only  to  vulgarise  it  and  who  caricature\nevery cause they serve, however sincerely.\nThough  Lebeziatnikov  was  so  good-natured,\nhe,  too,  was  beginning  to  dislike  Pyotr\nPetrovitch.  This  happened  on  both  sides\nunconsciously.  However  simple  Andrey\nSemyonovitch  might  be,  he  began  to  see  that\nPyotr  Petrovitch  was  duping  him  and  secretly\ndespising  him,  and  that  'he  was  not  the  right\nsort of man.' He had tried expounding to him the\nsystem of Fourier and the Darwinian theory, but\nof  late  Pyotr  Petrovitch  began  to  listen  too\nsarcastically and even to be rude. The fact was\nhe  had  begun  instinctively  to  guess  that", "Lebeziatnikov  was  not  merely  a  commonplace\nsimpleton, but, perhaps, a liar, too, and that he\nhad  no  connections  of  any  consequence  even\nin  his  own  circle,  but  had  simply  picked  things\nup  third-hand;  and  that  very  likely  he  did  not\neven  know  much  about  his  own  work  of\npropaganda, for he was in too great a muddle.\nA fine person he would be to show anyone up!\nIt  must  be  noted,  by  the  way,  that  Pyotr\nPetrovitch  had  during  those  ten  days  eagerly\naccepted  the  strangest  praise  from  Andrey\nSemyonovitch;  he  had  not  protested,  for\ninstance, when Andrey Semyonovitch belauded\nhim  for  being  ready  to  contribute  to  the\nestablishment  of  the  new  'commune,'  or  to\nabstain  from  christening  1(cid:24)  his  future  children,\nor to acquiesce if Dounia were to take a lover a\nmonth  after  marriage,  and  so  on.  Pyotr\nPetrovitch  so  enjoyed  hearing  his  own  praises\nthat he did not disdain even such virtues when\nthey were attributed to him.\nPyotr Petrovitch had had occasion that morning\nto  realise  some  five-  per-cent  bonds  and  now\nhe  sat  down  to  the  table  and  counted  over\nbundles  of  notes.  Andrey  Semyonovitch  who\nhardly  ever  had  any  money  walked  about  the", "room  pretending  to  himself  to  look  at  all  those\nbank  notes  with  indifference  and  even\ncontempt. Nothing would have convinced  Pyotr\n  Petrovitch    that    Andrey    Semyonovitch  could\nreally  look  on  the  money  unmoved,  and  the\nlatter,  on  his  side,  kept  thinking  bitterly  that\nPyotr  Petrovitch  was  capable  of  entertaining\nsuch an idea about him and was, perhaps, glad\nof the opportunity of teasing his young friend by\nreminding  him  of  his  inferiority  and  the  great\ndifference between them.\nHe found him incredibly inattentive and irritable,\nthough  he,  Andrey  Semyonovitch,  began\nenlarging  on  his  favourite  subject,  the\nfoundation  of  a  new  special  'commune.'  The\nbrief  remarks  that  dropped  from  Pyotr\nPetrovitch between the clicking of the beads on\nthe reckoning frame betrayed unmistakable and\ndiscourteous  irony.  But  the  'humane'  Andrey\nSemyonovitch  ascribed  Pyotr  Petrovitch's\nill-humour to his recent breach with Dounia and\nhe was burning with impatience to discourse on\nthat  theme.  He  had  something  progressive  to\nsay  on  the  subject  which  might  console  his\nworthy friend and 'could not fail' to promote his\ndevelopment.(cid:24)1(cid:24)  Crime  and  Punishment  'There", "is some sort of festivity being prepared at that ...\nat  the  widow's,  isn't  there?'  Pyotr  Petrovitch\nasked  suddenly,  interrupting  Andrey\nSemyonovitch at the most interesting passage.\n'Why,  don't  you  know?  Why,  I  was  telling  you\nlast  night  what  I  think  about  all  such\nceremonies.

It's  beyond  everything!'  continued\nPyotr  Petrovitch,  who  seemed  to  have  some\nobject in pursuing the conversation. 'What? You\nsay  I  am  asked  too?  When  was  that?  I  don't\nremember. But I shan't go. Why should I? I only\nsaid  a  word  to  her  in  passing  yesterday  of  the\npossibility of her obtaining a year's salary as a\ndestitute  widow  of  a  government  clerk.  I\nsuppose  she  has  invited  me  on  that  account,\nhasn't she? He-he-he!'\n'I don't intend to go either,' said Lebeziatnikov.", "'I should think not, after giving her a thrashing!\nYou might well hesitate, he-he!'\n'Who  thrashed?  Whom?'  cried  Lebeziatnikov,\nflustered and blushing.\n'Why, you thrashed Katerina Ivanovna a month\nago. I heard so yesterday ... so that's what your\nconvictions  amount  to  ...  and  the  woman\nquestion,  too,  wasn't  quite  sound,  he-he-he!'\nand  Pyotr  Petrovitch,  as  though  comforted,\nwent  back  to  clicking  his  beads.1(cid:24)  'It's  all\nslander  and  nonsense!'  cried  Lebeziatnikov,\nwho  was  always  afraid  of  allusions  to  the\nsubject.  'It  was  not  like  that  at  all,  it  was  quite\ndifferent.  You've  heard  it  wrong;  it's  a  libel.  I\nwas simply defending myself. She rushed at me\nfirst  with  her  nails,  she  pulled  out  all  my\nwhiskers.... It's permissable for anyone, I should\nhope,  to  defend  himself  and  I  never  allow\nanyone  to  use  violence  to  me  on  principle,  for\nit's  an  act  of  despotism.  What  was  I  to  do?  I\nsimply pushed her back.'\n'He-he-he!'  Luzhin  went  on  laughing\nmaliciously.", "'You  keep  on  like  that  because  you  are  out  of\nhumour  yourself....  But  that's  nonsense  and  it\nhas  nothing,  nothing  whatever  to  do  with  the\nwoman  question!  You  don't  understand;  I  used\nto think, indeed, that if women are equal to men\nin  all  respects,  even  in  strength  (as  is\nmaintained  now)  there  ought  to  be  equality  in\nthat,  too.  Of  course,  I  reflected  afterwards  that\nsuch  a  question  ought  not  really  to  arise,  for\nthere  ought  not  to  be  fighting  and  in  the  future\nsociety  fighting  is  unthinkable  ...  and  that  it\nwould  be  a  queer  thing  to  seek  for  equality  in\nfighting.

I am sorry, too, that with all\nthe  energy  and  resolution  in  protesting-which\nshe  has  already  shown  once-she  has  little\nself-reliance, little, so to say, independence, so\nas  to  break  free  from  certain  prejudices  and\ncertain  foolish  ideas.  Yet  she  thoroughly", "understands  some  (cid:24)(cid:24)0  Crime  and  Punishment\nquestions,  for  instance  about  kissing  of  hands,\nthat is, that it's an insult to a woman for a man\nto  kiss  her  hand,  because  it's  a  sign  of\ninequality.  We  had  a  debate  about  it  and  I\ndescribed it to her. She listened attentively to an\naccount  of  the  workmen's  associations  in\nFrance,  too.  Now  I  am  explaining  the  question\nof coming into the room in the future society.'\n'And what's that, pray?'\n'We had a debate lately on the question: Has a\nmember  of  the  community  the  right  to  enter\nanother  member's  room,  whether  man  or\nwoman, at any time ... and we decided that he\nhas!'\n'It might be at an inconvenient moment, he-he!'\nLebeziatnikov was really angry.\n'You  are  always  thinking  of  something\nunpleasant,' he cried with aversion. 'Tfoo! How\nvexed  I  am  that  when  I  was  expounding  our\nsystem, I referred prematurely to the question of\npersonal  privacy!  It's  always  a  stumbling-block", "to  people  like  you,  they  turn  it  into  ridicule\nbefore they understand it. And how proud they\nare  of  it,  too!  Tfoo!  I've  often  maintained  that\nthat  question  should  not  be  approached  by  a\nnovice till he has a firm faith in the system. And\ntell  me,  please,  what  do  you  find  so  shameful\neven  in  cesspools?  I  should  be  the  first  to  be\nready  to  clean  out  any  cesspool  you  like.  And\nit's  not  a  question  of  self-sacrifice,  it's  simply\nwork, honourable, useful work which is as good\nas any other and much better than the work of a\nRaphael  and  a  Pushkin,  because  it  is  more\nuseful.'\n'And  more  honourable,  more  honourable,\nhe-he-he!'(cid:24)1  'What  do  you  mean  by  'more\nhonourable'?  I  don't  understand  such\nexpressions  to  describe  human  activity.  'More\nhonourable,' 'nobler'- all those are old-fashioned\nprejudices which I reject. Everything which is of\nuse to mankind is honourable. I only understand\none word: useful! You can snigger as much as\nyou like, but that's so!'Pyotr  Petrovitch  laughed\n heartily.  He  had  finished counting the money\nand was putting it away. But some of the notes\nhe left on the table. The 'cesspool question' had\nalready  been  a  subject  of  dispute  between", "them.  What  was  absurd  was  that  it  made\nLebeziatnikov  really  angry,  while  it  amused\nLuzhin  and  at  that  moment  he  particularly\nwanted to anger his young friend.\n'It's  your  ill-luck  yesterday  that  makes  you  so\nill-humoured  and  annoying,'  blurted  out\nLebeziatnikov,  who  in  spite  of  his\n'independence' and his 'protests' did not venture\nto oppose Pyotr Petrovitch and still behaved to\nhim with some of the respect habitual in earlier\nyears.\n'You'd  better  tell  me  this,'  Pyotr  Petrovitch\ninterrupted  with  haughty  displeasure,  'can  you\n...  or  rather  are  you  really  friendly  enough  with\nthat young person to ask her to step in here for\na minute? I think they've all come back from the\ncemetery ... I heard the sound of steps ... I want\nto see her, that young person.'\n'What for?' Lebeziatnikov asked with surprise.\n'Oh,  I  want  to.  I  am  leaving  here  to-day  or\nto-morrow  and  therefore  I  wanted  to  speak  to\nher  about  ...  However,  you  may  be  present\nduring  the  interview.  It's  better  you  should  be,", "indeed. For there's no knowing what you might (cid:24)\nimagine.'\n'I  shan't  imagine  anything.  I  only  asked  and,  if\nyou've anything to say to her, nothing is easier\nthan to call her in. I'll go directly and you may be\nsure I won't be in your way.'\nFive  minutes  later  Lebeziatnikov  came  in  with\nSonia.  She  came  in  very  much  surprised  and\novercome  with  shyness  as  usual.  She  was\nalways  shy  in  such  circumstances  and  was\nalways afraid of new people, she had been as a\nchild  and  was  even  more  so  now....  Pyotr\nPetrovitch met her 'politely and affably,' but with\na certain shade of bantering familiarity which in\nhis  opinion  was  suitable  for  a  man  of  his\nrespectability  and  weight  in  dealing  with  a\ncreature so young and so interesting as she. He\nhastened  to  'reassure'  her  and  made  her  sit\ndown  facing  him  at  the  table.  Sonia  sat  down,\nlooked about her-at Lebeziatnikov, at the notes\nlying  on  the  table  and  then  again  at  Pyotr\nPetrovitch  and  her  eyes  remained  riveted  on\nhim.  Lebeziatnikov  was  moving  to  the  door.\nPyotr  Petrovitch  signed  to  Sonia  to  remain\nseated and stopped Lebeziatnikov.", "'Is  Raskolnikov  in  there?  Has  he  come?'  he\nasked him in a whisper.\n'Raskolnikov?  Yes.  Why?  Yes,  he  is  there.  I\nsaw him just come in.... Why?'\n'Well, I particularly beg you to remain here with\nus and not to leave me alone with this ... young\nwoman.  I  only  want  a  few  words  with  her,  but\nGod  knows  what  they  may  make  of  it.  I\nshouldn't like Raskolnikov to repeat anything....\nYou understand what I mean?'\n'I  understand!'  Lebeziatnikov  saw  the  point.\n'Yes,  you  are  (cid:24)(cid:24)  right....  Of  course,  I  am\nconvinced  personally  that  you  have  no  reason\nto be uneasy, but ... still, you are right. Certainly\nI'll stay. I'll stand here at the window and not be\nin your way ... I think you are right ...'\nPyotr Petrovitch returned to the sofa, sat down\nopposite  Sonia,  looked  attentively  at  her  and\nassumed  an  extremely  dignified,  even  severe\nexpression, as much as to say, 'don't you make\nany mistake, madam.' Sonia was overwhelmed\nwith embarrassment.", "'In  the  first  place,  Sofya  Semyonovna,  will  you\nmake my excuses to your respected mamma....\nThat's right, isn't it? Katerina Ivanovna stands in\nthe place of a mother to you?' \nPyotr  Petrovitch  began  with  great  dignity,\nthough affably.\nIt was evident that his intentions were friendly.\n'Quite  so,  yes;  the  place  of  a  mother,'  Sonia\nanswered, timidly and hurriedly.\n'Then  will  you  make  my  apologies  to  her?\nThrough inevitable circumstances I am forced to\nbe absent and shall not be at the dinner in spite\nof your mamma's kind invitation.'\n'Yes ... I'll tell her ... at once.'\nAnd Sonia hastily jumped up from her seat.\n'Wait,  that's  not  all,'  Pyotr  Petrovitch  detained\nher,  smiling  at  her  simplicity  and  ignorance  of\ngood manners, 'and you know me little, my dear\nSofya  Semyonovna,  if  you  suppose  I  would", "have ventured to trouble a person like you for a\nmatter of so little consequence affecting myself\nonly. I have another object.'\nSonia sat down hurriedly. Her eyes rested again\nfor an instant on the grey-and-rainbow-coloured\nnotes  that  re(cid:24)  mained  on  the  table,  but  she\nquickly  looked  away  and  fixed  her  eyes  on\nPyotr Petrovitch. She felt it horribly indecorous,\nespecially  for  her  to  look  at  another  person's\nmoney. She stared at the gold eye-glass which\nPyotr Petrovitch held in his left hand and at the\nmassive  and  extremely  handsome  ring  with  a\nyellow stone on his middle finger. But suddenly\nshe  looked  away  and,  not  knowing  where  to\nturn,  ended  by  staring  Pyotr  Petrovitch  again\nstraight in the face. After a pause of still greater\ndignity he continued.\n'I chanced yesterday in passing to exchange a\ncouple  of  words  with  Katerina  Ivanovna,  poor\nwoman.  That  was  sufficient  to  enable  me  to\nascertain that she is in a position-preternatural,\nif one may so express it.'\n'Yes  ...  preternatural  ...'  Sonia  hurriedly\nassented.", "'Or  it  would  be  simpler  and  more\ncomprehensible to say, ill.'\n'Yes, simpler and more comprehen ... yes, ill.'\n'Quite  so.  So  then  from  a  feeling  of  humanity\nand  so  to  speak  compassion,  I  should  be  glad\nto  be  of  service  to  her  in  any  way,  foreseeing\nher  unfortunate  position.  I  believe  the  whole  of\nthis  poverty-stricken  family  depends  now\nentirely on you?'\n'Allow  me  to  ask,'  Sonia  rose  to  her  feet,  'did\nyou  say  something  to  her  yesterday  of  the\npossibility  of  a  pension?  Because  she  told  me\nyou  had  undertaken  to  get  her  one.  Was  that\ntrue?'\n'Not  in  the  slightest,  and  indeed  it's  an\nabsurdity!  I  merely  hinted  at  her  obtaining\ntemporary assistance as the widow of an official\nwho  had  died  in  the  service-if  only  she  has  (cid:24)(cid:24)\npatronage  ...  but  apparently  your  late  parent\nhad not served his full term and had not indeed\nbeen in the service at all of late. In fact, if there\ncould be any hope, it would be very ephemeral,", "because there would be no claim for assistance\nin that case, far from it.... And she is dreaming\nof  a  pension  already,  he-he-he!  ...  A  go-ahead\nlady!'\n'Yes,  she  is.  For  she  is  credulous  and\ngood-hearted, and she believes everything from\nthe  goodness  of  her  heart  and  ...  and  ...  and\nshe is like that ... yes ... You must excuse her,'\nsaid Sonia, and again she got up to go.\n'But you haven't heard what I have to say.'\n'No, I haven't heard,' muttered Sonia.\n'Then sit down.' She was terribly confused; she\nsat down again a third time.\n'Seeing  her  position  with  her  unfortunate  little\nones, I should be glad, as I have said before, so\nfar as lies in my power, to be of service, that is,\nso far as is in my power, not more. One might\nfor  instance  get  up  a  subscription  for  her,  or  a\nlottery, something of the sort, such as is always\narranged  in  such  cases  by  friends  or  even\noutsiders desirous of assisting people. It was of\nthat  I  intended  to  speak  to  you;  it  might  be", "done.'\n'Yes,  yes  ...  God  will  repay  you  for  it,'  faltered\nSonia, gazing intently at Pyotr Petrovitch.\n'It might be, but we will talk of it later. We might\nbegin  it  to-day,  we  will  talk  it  over  this  evening\nand lay the foundation so to speak. Come to me\nat seven o'clock. Mr. Lebeziatnikov, I hope, will\nassist  us.  But  there  is  one  circumstance  of\nwhich I ought to warn you beforehand and for (cid:24)\nwhich  I  venture  to  trouble  you,  Sofya\nSemyonovna,  to  come  here.  In  my  opinion\nmoney  cannot  be,  indeed  it's  unsafe  to  put  it\ninto Katerina Ivanovna's own hands. The dinner\nto-day is a proof of that. Though she has not, so\nto speak, a crust of bread for to-morrow and ...\nwell,  boots  or  shoes,  or  anything;  she  has\nbought  to-day  Jamaica  rum,  and  even,  I\nbelieve, Madeira and ... and coffee. I saw it as I\npassed  through.  To-morrow  it  will  all  fall  upon\nyou again, they won't have a crust of bread. It's\nabsurd,  really,  and  so,  to  my  thinking,  a\nsubscription  ought  to  be  raised  so  that  the\nunhappy widow should not know of the money,\nbut only you, for instance. Am I right?'", "'I  don't  know  ...  this  is  only  to-day,  once  in  her\nlife....  She  was  so  anxious  to  do  honour,  to\ncelebrate  the  memory....  And  she  is  very\nsensible ... but just as you think and I shall be\nvery,  very  ...  they  will  all  be  ...  and  God  will\nreward ... and the orphans ...'\nSonia burst into tears.\n'Very  well,  then,  keep  it  in  mind;  and  now  will\nyou  accept  for  the  benefit  of  your  relation  the\nsmall  sum  that  I  am  able  to  spare,  from  me\npersonally.  I  am  very  anxious  that  my  name\nshould  not  be  mentioned  in  connection  with  it.\nHere ... having so to speak anxieties of my own,\nI cannot do more ...'\nAnd  Pyotr  Petrovitch  held  out  to  Sonia  a\nten-rouble note carefully unfolded. Sonia took it,\nflushed  crimson,  jumped  up,  muttered\nsomething  and  began  taking  leave.  Pyotr\nPetrovitch  accompanied  her  ceremoniously  to\nthe  door.  She  got  out  of  the  room  at  last,\nagitated  and  distressed,  and  (cid:24)(cid:24)  returned  to\nKaterina  Ivanovna,  overwhelmed  with\nconfusion.", "All  this  time  Lebeziatnikov  had  stood  at  the\nwindow or walked about the room, anxious not\nto  interrupt  the  conversation;  when  Sonia  had\ngone  he  walked  up  to  Pyotr  Petrovitch  and\nsolemnly held out his hand.\n'I  heard  and  saw  everything,'  he  said,  laying\nstress  on  the  last  verb.  'That  is  honourable,  I\nmean to say, it's humane! You wanted to avoid\ngratitude,  I  saw!  And  although  I  cannot,  I\nconfess,  in  principle  sympathise  with  private\ncharity,  for  it  not  only  fails  to  eradicate  the  evil\nbut even promotes it, yet I must admit that I saw\nyour action with pleasure-yes, yes, I like it.'\n'That's all nonsense,' muttered Pyotr Petrovitch,\nsomewhat  disconcerted,  looking  carefully  at\nLebeziatnikov.\n'No, it's not nonsense! A man who has suffered\ndistress  and  annoyance  as  you  did  yesterday\nand who yet can sympathise with the misery of\nothers, such a man ... even though he is making\na  social  mistake-is  still  deserving  of  respect!  I\ndid not expect it indeed of you, Pyotr Petrovitch,\nespecially  as  according  to  your  ideas  ...  oh,\nwhat  a  drawback  your  ideas  are  to  you!  How", "distressed  you  are  for  instance  by  your  ill-luck\nyesterday,'  cried  the  simple-hearted\nLebeziatnikov,  who  felt  a  return  of  affection  for\nPyotr  Petrovitch.  'And,  what  do  you  want  with\nmarriage,  with  legal  marriage,  my  dear,  noble\nPyotr  Petrovitch?  Why  do  you  cling  to  this\nlegality  of  marriage?  Well,  you  may  beat  me  if\nyou like, but I am glad, positively glad it hasn't\ncome  off,  that  you  are  free,  that  you  are  not\nquite lost for humanity.... you see, I've spo(cid:24) ken\nmy mind!'\n'Because  I  don't  want  in  your  free  marriage  to\nbe made a fool of and to bring up another man's\nchildren,  that's  why  I  want  legal  marriage,'\nLuzhin replied in order to make some answer.\nHe seemed preoccupied by something.\n'Children?  You  referred  to  children,'\nLebeziatnikov started off like a warhorse at the\ntrumpet call. 'Children are a social question and\na  question  of  first  importance,  I  agree;  but  the\nquestion of children has another solution. Some\nrefuse  to  have  children  altogether,  because\nthey  suggest  the  institution  of  the  family.  We'll\nspeak  of  children  later,  but  now  as  to  the", "question  of  honour,  I  confess  that's  my  weak\npoint.    That    horrid,    military,    Pushkin \nexpression    is    unthinkable  in  the  dictionary  of\nthe  future.  What  does  it  mean  indeed?  It's\nnonsense,  there  will  be  no  deception  in  a  free\nmarriage! That is only the natural consequence\nof  a  legal  marriage,  so  to  say,  its  corrective,  a\nprotest. So that indeed it's not humiliating ... and\nif  I  ever,  to  suppose  an  absurdity,  were  to  be\nlegally married, I should be positively glad of it. I\nshould say to my wife: 'My dear, hitherto I have\nloved you, now I respect you, for you've shown\nyou can protest!' You laugh! That's because you\nare  of  incapable  of  getting  away  from\nprejudices.  Confound  it  all!  I  understand  now\nwhere the unpleasantness is of being deceived\nin a legal marriage, but it's simply a despicable\nconsequence  of  a  despicable  position  in  which\nboth  are  humiliated.  When  the  deception  is\nopen,  as  in  a  free  marriage,  then  it  does  not\nexist,  it's  unthinkable.  Your  wife  will  only  prove\nhow  she  respects  you  (cid:24)(cid:24)  by  considering  you\nincapable  of  opposing  her  happiness  and\navenging yourself on her for her new husband.\nDamn  it  all!  I  sometimes  dream  if  I  were  to  be\nmarried, pfoo! I mean if I were to marry, legally\nor  not,  it's  just  the  same,  I  should  present  my", "wife  with  a  lover  if  she  had  not  found  one  for\nherself. 'My dear,' I should say, 'I love you, but\neven more than that I desire you to respect me.\nSee!' Am I not right?'\nPyotr  Petrovitch  sniggered  as  he  listened,  but\nwithout  much  merriment.  He  hardly  heard  it\nindeed.  He  was  preoccupied  with  something\nelse  and  even  Lebeziatnikov  at  last  noticed  it.\nPyotr Petrovitch seemed excited and rubbed his\nhands.  Lebeziatnikov  remembered  all  this  and\nreflected  upon  it  afterwards.(cid:24)(cid:24)0  Crime  and\nPunishment ", "#$#$Chapter 32#$#$\nt would be difficult to explain exactly what could\nhave \noriginated  the  idea  of  that  senseless  dinner  in\nKaterina  Ivanovna's  disordered  brain.  Nearly\nten of the twenty roubles, given by Raskolnikov\nfor Marmeladov's funeral, were wasted upon it.\nPossibly  Katerina  Ivanovna  felt  obliged  to\nhonour  the  memory  of  the  deceased  'suitably,'\nthat  all  the  lodgers,  and  still  more  Amalia\nIvanovna,  might  know  'that  he  was  in  no  way\ntheir  inferior,  and  perhaps  very  much  their\nsuperior,' and that no one had the right 'to turn\nup his nose at him.' Perhaps the chief element\nwas  that  peculiar  'poor  man's  pride,'  which\ncompels  many  poor  people  to  spend  their  last\nsavings  on  some  traditional  social  ceremony,\nsimply in order to do 'like other people,' and not\nto  'be  looked  down  upon.'  It  is  very  probable,\ntoo,  that  Katerina  Ivanovna  longed  on  this\noccasion,  at  the  moment  when  she  seemed  to\nbe  abandoned  by  everyone,  to  show  those\n'wretched  contemptible  lodgers'  that  she  knew", "'how to do things, how to entertain' and that she\nhad  been  brought  up  'in  a  genteel,  she  might\nalmost say aristocratic colonel's family' and had\nnot  been  meant  for  sweeping  floors  and\nwashing  the  children's  rags  at  night.  Even  the\npoorest  and  most  broken-spirited  people  are\nsometimes  liable  to  these  paroxysms  of  pride\nand vanity which take the form of an irresistible\nnervous  craving.  And  Katerina  Ivanovna  was\nnot  broken-spirited;  (cid:24)1  she  might  have  been\nkilled  by  circumstance,  but  her  spirit  could  not\nhave  been  broken,  that  is,  she  could  not  have\nbeen intimidated, her will could not be crushed.\nMoreover Sonia had said with good reason that\nher mind was unhinged. She could not be said\nto be insane, but for a year past she had been\nso  harassed  that  her  mind  might  well  be\noverstrained.  The  later  stages  of  consumption\nare apt, doctors tell us, to affect the intellect.\nThere  was  no  great  variety  of  wines,  nor  was\nthere  Madeira;  but  wine  there  was.  There  was\nvodka, rum and Lisbon wine, all of the poorest\nquality  but  in  sufficient  quantity.  Besides  the\ntraditional  rice  and  honey,  there  were  three  or\nfour  dishes,  one  of  which  consisted  of\npancakes,  all  prepared  in  Amalia  Ivanovna's", "kitchen.  Two  samovars  were  boiling,  that  tea\nand  punch  might  be  offered  after  dinner.\nKaterina  Ivanovna  had  herself  seen  to\npurchasing the provisions, with the help of one\nof  the  lodgers,  an  unfortunate  little  Pole  who\nhad  somehow  been  stranded  at  Madame\nLippevechsel's.  He  promptly  put  himself  at\nKaterina  Ivanovna's  disposal  and  had  been  all\nthat  morning  and  all  the  day  before  running\nabout  as  fast  as  his  legs  could  carry  him,  and\nvery anxious that everyone should be aware of\nit.  For  every  trifle  he  ran  to  Katerina  Ivanovna,\neven  hunting  her  out  at  the  bazaar,  at  every\ninstant called her 'Pani. ' She was heartily sick\nof him before the end, though she had declared\nat  first  that  she  could  not  have  got  on  without\nthis 'serviceable and magnanimous man.' It was\none  of  Katerina  Ivanovna's  characteristics  to\npaint  everyone  she  met  in  the  most  glowing\ncolours.  Her  praises  were  so  exaggerated  as  (cid:24)\nsometimes  to  be  embarrassing;  she  would\ninvent various circumstances to the credit of her\nnew  acquaintance  and  quite  genuinely  believe\nin their reality. Then all of a sudden she would\nbe  disillusioned  and  would  rudely  and\ncontemptuously  repulse  the  person  she  had\nonly  a  few  hours  before  been  literally  adoring.", "She  was  naturally  of  a  gay,  lively  and\npeace-loving  disposition,  but  from  continual\nfailures and misfortunes she had come to desire\nso  keenly  that  all  should  live  in  peace  and  joy\nand should not dare to break the peace, that the\nslightest  jar,  the  smallest  disaster  reduced  her\nalmost  to  frenzy,  and  she  would  pass  in  an\ninstant from the brightest hopes and fancies to\ncursing  her  fate  and  raving,  and  knocking  her\nhead against the wall.\nAmalia  Ivanovna,  too,  suddenly  acquired\nextraordinary importance in Katerina Ivanovna's\neyes and was treated by her with extraordinary\nrespect, probably only because \nAmalia  Ivanovna  had  thrown  herself  heart  and\nsoul into the preparations. She had undertaken\nto  lay  the  table,  to  provide  the  linen,  crockery,\netc., and to cook the dishes in her kitchen, and\nKaterina  Ivanovna  had  left  it  all  in  her  hands\nand  gone  herself  to  the  cemetery.  Everything\nhad  been  well  done.  Even  the  table-cloth  was\nnearly  clean;  the  crockery,  knives,  forks  and\nglasses  were,  of  course,  of  all  shapes  and\npatterns, lent by different lodgers, but the table\nwas properly laid at the time fixed, and Amalia", "Ivanovna,  feeling  she  had  done  her  work  well,\nhad  put  on  a  black  silk  dress  and  a  cap  with\nnew  mourning  ribbons  and  met  the  returning\nparty  with  some  pride.  This  pride,  though\njustifiable,  displeased  Katerina  Ivanovna  for\nsome  reason:  'as  though  the  (cid:24)(cid:24)  table  could  not\nhave been laid except by Amalia Ivanovna!' She\ndisliked  the  cap  with  new  ribbons,  too.  'Could\nshe  be  stuck  up,  the  stupid  German,  because\nshe  was  mistress  of  the  house,  and  had\nconsented as a favour to help her poor lodgers!\nAs  a  favour!  Fancy  that!  Katerina  Ivanovna's\nfather  who  had  been  a  colonel  and  almost  a\ngovernor  had  sometimes  had  the  table  set  for\nforty  persons,  and  then  anyone  like  Amalia\nIvanovna, or rather Ludwigovna, would not have\nbeen allowed into the kitchen.'\nKaterina Ivanovna, however, put off expressing\nher  feelings  for  the  time  and  contented  herself\nwith  treating  her  coldly,  though  she  decided\ninwardly  that  she  would  certainly  have  to  put\nAmalia Ivanovna down and set her in her proper\nplace,  for  goodness  only  knew  what  she  was\nfancying herself. Katerina Ivanovna was irritated\ntoo  by  the  fact  that  hardly  any  of  the  lodgers\ninvited had come to the funeral, except the Pole", "who had just managed to run into the cemetery,\nwhile  to  the  memorial  dinner  the  poorest  and\nmost  insignificant  of  them  had  turned  up,  the\nwretched  creatures,  many  of  them  not  quite\nsober. The older and more respectable of them\nall,  as  if  by  common  consent,  stayed  away.\nPyotr Petrovitch Luzhin, for instance, who might\nbe  said  to  be  the  most  respectable  of  all  the\nlodgers, did not appear, though \nKaterina  Ivanovna  had  the  evening  before  told\nall the world, that is Amalia Ivanovna, Polenka,\nSonia  and  the  Pole,  that  he  was  the  most\ngenerous,  noble-hearted  man  with  a  large\nproperty and vast connections, who had been a\nfriend of her first husband's, and a guest in her\nfather's house, and that he had promised to use\nall  his  influence  to  secure  her  a  (cid:24)  considerable\npension.  It  must  be  noted  that  when  Katerina\nIvanovna  exalted  anyone's  connections  and\nfortune, it was without any ulterior motive, quite\ndisinterestedly, for the mere pleasure of adding\nto  the  consequence  of  the  person  praised.\nProbably  'taking  his  cue'  from  Luzhin,  'that\ncontemptible  wretch  Lebeziatnikov  had  not\nturned up either. What did he fancy himself? He\nwas only asked out of kindness and because he", "was  sharing  the  same  room  with  Pyotr\nPetrovitch  and  was  a  friend  of  his,  so  that  it\nwould have been awkward not to invite him.'\nAmong  those  who  failed  to  appear  were  'the\ngenteel  lady  and  her  old-  maidish  daughter,'\nwho had only been lodgers in the house for the\nlast fortnight, but had several times complained\nof  the  noise  and  uproar  in  Katerina  Ivanovna's\nroom,  especially  when  Marmeladov  had  come\nback  drunk.  Katerina  Ivanovna  heard  this  from\nAmalia Ivanovna who, quarrelling with Katerina\nIvanovna,  and  threatening  to  turn  the  whole\nfamily out of doors, had shouted at her that they\n'were  not  worth  the  foot'  of  the  honourable\nlodgers  whom  they  were  disturbing.  Katerina\nIvanovna determined now to invite this lady and\nher  daughter,  'whose  foot  she  was  not  worth,'\nand  who  had  turned  away  haughtily  when  she\ncasually met them, so that they might know that\n'she  was  more  noble  in  her  thoughts  and\nfeelings and did not harbour malice,' and might\nsee that she was not accustomed to her way of\nliving.  She  had  proposed  to  make  this  clear  to\nthem at dinner with allusions to her late father's\ngovernorship, and also at the same time to hint\nthat  it  was  exceedingly  stupid  of  them  to  turn", "away  on  meeting  her.  The  fat  colonel-major  (cid:24)(cid:24)\n(he was really a discharged officer of low rank)\nwas  also  absent,  but  it  appeared  that  he  had\nbeen  'not  himself'  for  the  last  two  days.  The\nparty consisted of the Pole, a wretched looking\nclerk with a spotty face and a greasy coat, who\nhad  not  a  word  to  say  for  himself,  and  smelt\nabominably,  a  deaf  and  almost  blind  old  man\nwho had once been in the post office and who\nhad been from immemorial ages maintained by\nsomeone at Amalia Ivanovna's.\nA  retired  clerk  of  the  commissariat  department\ncame, too; he was drunk, had a loud and most\nunseemly  laugh  and  only  fancy-was  without  a\nwaistcoat! One of the visitors sat straight down\nto  the  table  without  even  greeting  Katerina\nIvanovna.  Finally  one  person  having  no  suit\nappeared in his dressing-gown, but this was too\nmuch,  and  the  efforts  of  Amalia  Ivanovna  and\nthe Pole succeeded in removing him. The Pole\nbrought with him, however, two other Poles who\ndid not live at Amalia Ivanovna's and whom no\none  had  seen  here  before.  All  this  irritated\nKaterina  Ivanovna  intensely.  'For  whom  had\nthey  made  all  these  preparations  then?'  To\nmake room for the visitors the children had not", "even been laid for at the table; but the two little\nones  were  sitting  on  a  bench  in  the  furthest\ncorner  with  their  dinner  laid  on  a  box,  while\nPolenka  as  a  big  girl  had  to  look  after  them,\nfeed  them,  and  keep  their  noses  wiped  like\nwell-bred children's.\nKaterina  Ivanovna,  in  fact,  could  hardly  help\nmeeting  her  guests  with  increased  dignity,  and\neven haughtiness. She stared at some of them\nwith  special  severity,  and  loftily  invited  them  to\ntake their seats. Rushing to the conclusion (cid:24) that\nAmalia Ivanovna must be responsible for those\nwho  were  absent,  she  began  treating  her  with\nextreme nonchalance, which the latter promptly\nobserved  and  resented.  Such  a  beginning  was\nno  good  omen  for  the  end.  All  were  seated  at\nlast.\nRaskolnikov  came  in  almost  at  the  moment  of\ntheir  return  from  the  cemetery.  Katerina\nIvanovna  was  greatly  delighted  to  see  him,  in\nthe  first  place,  because  he  was  the  one\n'educated  visitor,  and,  as  everyone  knew,  was\nin  two  years  to  take  a  professorship  in  the\nuniversity,'  and  secondly  because  he\nimmediately  and  respectfully  apologised  for", "having  been  unable  to  be  at  the  funeral.  She\npositively pounced upon him, and made him sit\non  her  left  hand  (Amalia  Ivanovna  was  on  her\nright).  In  spite  of  her  continual  anxiety  that  the\ndishes  should  be  passed  round  correctly  and\nthat everyone should taste them, in spite of the\nagonising  cough  which  interrupted  her  every\nminute  and  seemed  to  have  grown  worse\nduring the last few days, she hastened to pour\nout  in  a  half  whisper  to  Raskolnikov  all  her\nsuppressed feelings and her just indignation at\nthe  failure  of  the  dinner,  interspersing  her\nremarks  with  lively  and  uncontrollable  laughter\nat the expense of her visitors and especially of\nher landlady.\n'It's  all  that  cuckoo's  fault!  You  know  whom  I\nmean?  Her,  her!'  Katerina  Ivanovna  nodded\ntowards the landlady. 'Look at her, she's making\nround eyes, she feels that we are talking about\nher and can't understand. Pfoo, the owl! Haha!\n(Cough-cough-cough.)  And  what  does  she  put\non  that  cap  for?  (Cough-cough-cough.)  Have\nyou  noticed  that  she  (cid:24)(cid:24)  wants  everyone  to\nconsider  that  she  is  patronising  me  and  doing\nme an honour by being here? I asked her like a\nsensible  woman  to  invite  people,  especially", "those  who  knew  my  late  husband,  and  look  at\nthe  set  of  fools  she  has  brought!  The  sweeps!\nLook at that one with the spotty face. And those\n  wretched    Poles,    ha-ha-ha! \n(Cough-cough-cough.)  Not  one  of  them  has\never poked his nose in here, I've never set eyes\non  them.  What  have  they  come  here  for,  I  ask\nyou?  There  they  sit  in  a  row.  Hey,  pan!'  she\ncried suddenly to one of them, 'have you tasted\nthe  pancakes?  Take  some  more!  Have  some\nbeer!  Won't  you  have  some  vodka?  Look,  he's\njumped  up  and  is  making  his  bows,  they  must\nbe  quite  starved,  poor  things.  Never  mind,  let\nthem  eat!  They  don't  make  a  noise,  anyway,\nthough I'm really afraid for our landlady's silver\nspoons ... Amalia Ivanovna!' she addressed her\nsuddenly,  almost  aloud,  'if  your  spoons  should\nhappen  to  be  stolen,  I  won't  be  responsible,  I\nwarn  you!  Ha-ha-ha!'  She  laughed  turning  to\nRaskolnikov,  and  again  nodding  towards  the\nlandlady,  in  high  glee  at  her  sally.  'She  didn't\nunderstand,  she  didn't  understand  again!  Look\nhow  she  sits  with  her  mouth  open!  An  owl,  a\nreal owl! An owl in new ribbons, ha-ha-ha!'\nHere  her  laugh  turned  again  to  an  insufferable\nfit of coughing that lasted five minutes. Drops of", "perspiration stood out on her forehead and her\nhandkerchief  was  stained  with  blood.  She\nshowed  Raskolnikov  the  blood  in  silence,  and\nas  soon  as  she  could  get  her  breath  began\nwhispering to him again with extreme animation\nand  a  hectic  flush  on  her  cheeks.(cid:24)  'Do  you\nknow, I gave her the most delicate instructions,\nso  to  speak,  for  inviting  that  lady  and  her\ndaughter,  you  understand  of  whom  I  am\nspeaking?  It  needed  the  utmost  delicacy,  the\ngreatest nicety, but she has managed things so\nthat  that  fool,  that  conceited  baggage,  that\nprovincial  nonentity,  simply  because  she  is  the\nwidow of a major, and has come to try and get a\npension  and  to  fray  out  her  skirts  in  the\ngovernment  offices,  because  at  fifty  she  paints\nher face (everybody knows it) ... a creature like\nthat did not think fit to come, and has not even\nanswered  the  invitation,  which  the  most\nordinary  good  manners  required!  I  can't\nunderstand why Pyotr Petrovitch has not come?\nBut  where's  Sonia?  Where  has  she  gone?  Ah,\nthere  she  is  at  last!  what  is  it,  Sonia,  where\nhave  you  been?  It's  odd  that  even  at  your\nfather's  funeral  you  should  be  so  unpunctual.\nRodion Romanovitch, make room for her beside\nyou. That's your place, Sonia ... take what you", "like.  Have  some  of  the  cold  entrée  with  jelly,\nthat's  the  best.  They'll  bring  the  pancakes\ndirectly.  Have  they  given  the  children  some?\nPolenka,  have  you  got  everything?\n(Cough-cough-cough.)  That's  all  right.  Be  a\ngood girl, Lida, and, Kolya, don't fidget with your\nfeet;  sit  like  a  little  gentleman.  What  are  you\nsaying, Sonia?'\nSonia  hastened  to  give  her  Pyotr  Petrovitch's\napologies,  trying  to  speak  loud  enough  for\neveryone  to  hear  and  carefully  choosing  the\nmost respectful phrases which she attributed to\nPyotr  Petrovitch.  She  added  that  Pyotr\nPetrovitch  had  particularly  told  her  to  say  that,\nas  soon  as  he  possibly  could,  he  would  come\nimmediately to discuss business alone with her\nand  to  consider  what  could  be  done  for  (cid:24)(cid:24)  her,\netc., etc.\nSonia  knew  that  this  would  comfort  Katerina\nIvanovna, would flatter her and gratify her pride.\nShe  sat  down  beside  Raskolnikov;  she  made\nhim  a  hurried  bow,  glancing  curiously  at  him.\nBut for the rest of the time she seemed to avoid\nlooking at him or speaking to him. She seemed\nabsent-minded,  though  she  kept  looking  at", "Katerina Ivanovna, trying to please her. Neither\nshe nor Katerina Ivanovna had been able to get\nmourning;  Sonia  was  wearing  dark  brown,  and\nKaterina Ivanovna had on her only dress, a dark\nstriped cotton one.\nThe  message  from  Pyotr  Petrovitch  was  very\nsuccessful.  Listening  to  Sonia  with  dignity,\nKaterina  Ivanovna  inquired  with  equal  dignity\nhow  Pyotr  Petrovitch  was,  then  at  once\nwhispered  almost  aloud  to  Raskolnikov  that  it\ncertainly would have been strange for a man of\nPyotr  Petrovitch's  position  and  standing  to  find\nhimself in such 'extraordinary company,' in spite\nof  his  devotion  to  her  family  and  his  old\nfriendship with her father.\n'That's  why  I  am  so  grateful  to  you,  Rodion\nRomanovitch,  that  you  have  not  disdained  my\nhospitality,  even  in  such  surroundings,'  she\nadded  almost  aloud.  'But  I  am  sure  that  it  was\nonly your special affection for my poor husband\nthat has made you keep your promise.'\nThen  once  more  with  pride  and  dignity  she\nscanned  her  visitors,  and  suddenly  inquired\naloud  across  the  table  of  the  deaf  man:", "'Wouldn't he have some more meat, and had he\nbeen given some wine?' The old man made no\nanswer  and  for  a  long  while  could  not\nunderstand  what  he  was  asked,  (cid:24)(cid:24)0  Crime  and\nPunishment  though  his  neighbours  amused\nthemselves  by  poking  and  shaking  him.  He\nsimply  gazed  about  him  with  his  mouth  open,\nwhich only increased the general mirth.\n'What  an  imbecile!  Look,  look!  Why  was  he\nbrought?  But  as  to  Pyotr  Petrovitch,  I  always\nhad confidence in him,' \nKaterina  Ivanovna  continued,  'and,  of  course,\nhe  is  not  like  ...'  with  an  extremely  stern  face\nshe addressed Amalia Ivanovna so sharply and\nloudly that the latter was quite disconcerted, 'not\nlike  your  dressed  up  draggletails  whom  my\nfather  would  not  have  taken  as  cooks  into  his\nkitchen, and my late husband would have done\nthem  honour  if  he  had  invited  them  in  the\ngoodness of his heart.'\n'Yes, he was fond of drink, he was fond of it, he\ndid drink!' cried the commissariat clerk, gulping\ndown his twelfth glass of vodka.", "'My  late  husband  certainly  had  that  weakness,\nand  everyone  knows  it,'  Katerina  Ivanovna\nattacked  him  at  once,  'but  he  was  a  kind  and\nhonourable  man,  who  loved  and  respected  his\nfamily.  The  worst  of  it  was  his  good  nature\nmade him trust all sorts of disreputable people,\nand  he  drank  with  fellows  who  were  not  worth\nthe  sole  of  his  shoe.  Would  you  believe  it,\nRodion Romanovitch, they found a gingerbread\ncock  in  his  pocket;  he  was  dead  drunk,  but  he\ndid not forget the children!'\n'A  cock?  Did  you  say  a  cock?'  shouted  the\ncommissariat clerk.\nKaterina  Ivanovna  did  not  vouchsafe  a  reply.\nShe sighed, lost in thought.\n'No  doubt  you  think,  like  everyone,  that  I  was\ntoo  se-(cid:24)1  vere  with  him,'  she  went  on,\naddressing  Raskolnikov.  'But  that's  not  so!  He\nrespected me, he respected me very much! He\nwas  a  kind-hearted  man!  And  how  sorry  I  was\nfor him sometimes! He would sit in a corner and\nlook  at  me,  I  used  to  feel  so  sorry  for  him,  I\nused to want to be kind to him and then would\nthink to myself: 'Be kind to him and he will drink", "again,'  it  was  only  by  severity  that  you  could\nkeep him within bounds.'\n'Yes, he used to get his hair pulled pretty often,'\nroared the commissariat clerk again, swallowing\nanother glass of vodka.\n'Some  fools  would  be  the  better  for  a  good\ndrubbing,  as  well  as  having  their  hair  pulled.  I\nam  not  talking  of  my  late  husband  now!'\nKaterina Ivanovna snapped at him.\nThe  flush  on  her  cheeks  grew  more  and  more\nmarked,  her  chest  heaved.  In  another  minute\nshe  would  have  been  ready  to  make  a  scene.\nMany  of  the  visitors  were  sniggering,  evidently\ndelighted. They began poking the commissariat\nclerk  and  whispering  something  to  him.  They\nwere evidently trying to egg him on.\n'Allow  me  to  ask  what  are  you  alluding  to,'\nbegan the clerk, 'that is to say, whose ... about\nwhom  ...  did  you  say  just  now  ...  But  I  don't\ncare!  That's  nonsense!  Widow!  I  forgive  you....\nPass!'\nAnd he took another drink of vodka.", "Raskolnikov  sat  in  silence,  listening  with\ndisgust. He only ate from politeness, just tasting\nthe food that Katerina Ivanovna was continually\nputting  on  his  plate,  to  avoid  hurting  her\nfeelings.  He  watched  Sonia  intently.  But  Sonia\nbecame  (cid:24)  more  and  more  anxious  and\ndistressed;  she,  too,  foresaw  that  the  dinner\nwould  not  end  peaceably,  and  saw  with  terror\nKaterina Ivanovna's growing irritation. She knew\nthat  she,  Sonia,  was  the  chief  reason  for  the\n'genteel'  ladies'  contemptuous  treatment  of\nKaterina  Ivanovna's  invitation.  She  had  heard\nfrom  Amalia  Ivanovna  that  the  mother  was\npositively  offended  at  the  invitation  and  had\nasked  the  question:  'How  could  she  let  her\ndaughter  sit  down  beside  that  young  person?'\nSonia had a feeling that Katerina Ivanovna had\nalready heard this and an insult to Sonia meant\nmore  to  Katerina  Ivanovna  than  an  insult  to\nherself, her children, or her father, Sonia knew\nthat  Katerina  Ivanovna  would  not  be  satisfied\nnow, 'till she had shown those draggletails that\nthey  were  both  ...'  To  make  matters  worse\nsomeone  passed  Sonia,  from  the  other  end  of\nthe  table,  a  plate  with  two  hearts  pierced  with\nan  arrow,  cut  out  of  black  bread.  Katerina", "Ivanovna  flushed  crimson  and  at  once  said\naloud across the table that the man who sent it\nwas 'a drunken ass!'\nAmalia  Ivanovna  was  foreseeing  something\namiss,  and  at  the  same  time  deeply  wounded\nby  Katerina  Ivanovna's  haughtiness,  and  to\nrestore  the  good-humour  of  the  company  and\nraise  herself  in  their  esteem  she  began,\napropos  of  nothing,  telling  a  story  about  an\nacquaintance  of  hers  'Karl  from  the  chemist's,'\nwho was driving one night in a cab, and that 'the\ncabman wanted him to kill, and Karl very much\nbegged  him  not  to  kill,  and  wept  and  clasped\nhands, and frightened and from fear pierced his\nheart.'  Though  Katerina  Ivanovna  smiled,  she\nobserved  at  once  that  Amalia  Ivanovna  ought\nnot to tell anecdotes in Russian; the latter (cid:24)(cid:24) was\nstill  more  offended,  and  she  retorted  that  her\n'Vater aus Berlin was a very important man, and\nalways went with his hands in pockets.' Katerina\nIvanovna could not restrain herself and laughed\nso much that Amalia Ivanovna lost patience and\ncould scarcely control herself.\n'Listen to the owl!' Katerina Ivanovna whispered\nat once, her good- humour almost restored, 'she", "meant to say he kept his hands in his pockets,\nbut  she  said  he  put  his  hands  in  people's\npockets.  (Cough-  cough.)  And  have  you\nnoticed,  Rodion  Romanovitch,  that  all  these\nPetersburg foreigners, the Germans especially,\nare all stupider than we! Can you fancy anyone\nof  us  telling  how  'Karl  from  the  chemist's'\n'pierced  his  heart  from  fear'  and  that  the  idiot,\ninstead  of  punishing  the  cabman,  'clasped  his\nhands  and  wept,  and  much  begged.'  Ah,  the\nfool!  And  you  know  she  fancies  it's  very\ntouching and does not suspect how stupid she\nis!  To  my  thinking  that  drunken  commissariat\nclerk  is  a  great  deal  cleverer,  anyway  one  can\nsee that he has addled his brains with drink, but\nyou  know,  these  foreigners  are  always  so  well\nbehaved  and  serious....  Look  how  she  sits\nglaring!  She  is  angry,  ha-ha!\n(Cough-cough-cough.)'\nRegaining her good-humour, Katerina Ivanovna\nbegan  at  once  telling  Raskolnikov  that  when\nshe had obtained her pension, she intended to\nopen a school for the daughters of gentlemen in\nher native town T--. This was the first time she\nhad  spoken  to  him  of  the  project,  and  she\nlaunched  out  into  the  most  alluring  details.  It", "suddenly appeared that Katerina Ivanovna had\nin  her  hands  the  very  certificate  of  honour  of\nwhich Marmeladov had spoken to Raskolnikov (cid:24)\nin  the  tavern,  when  he  told  him  that  Katerina\nIvanovna, his wife, had danced the shawl dance\nbefore the governor and other great personages\non leaving school. This certificate of honour was\nobviously  intended  now  to  prove  Katerina\nIvanovna's right to open a boarding-school; but\nshe  had  armed  herself  with  it  chiefly  with  the\nobject  of  overwhelming  'those  two  stuck-up\ndraggletails'  if  they  came  to  the  dinner,  and\nproving  incontestably  that  Katerina  Ivanovna\nwas  of  the  most  noble,  'she  might  even  say\naristocratic family, a colonel's daughter and was\nfar superior to certain adventuresses who have\nbeen so much to the fore of late.' The certificate\nof honour immediately passed into the hands of\nthe drunken guests, and Katerina Ivanovna did\nnot  try  to  retain  it,  for  it  actually  contained  the\nstatement  en  toutes  lettres  that  her  father  was\nof the rank of a major, and also a companion of\nan  order,  so  that  she  really  was  almost  the\ndaughter of a colonel.\nWarming  up,  Katerina  Ivanovna  proceeded  to\nenlarge  on  the  peaceful  and  happy  life  they", "would  lead  in  T--,  on  the  gymnasium  teachers\nwhom she would engage to give lessons in her\nboarding-school,  one  a  most  respectable  old\nFrenchman,  one  Mangot,  who  had  taught\nKaterina  Ivanovna  herself  in  old  days  and  was\nstill  living  in  T--,  and  would  no  doubt  teach  in\nher school on moderate terms. Next she spoke\nof Sonia who would go with her to T-- and help\nher  in  all  her  plans.  At  this  someone  at  the\nfurther end of the table gave a sudden guffaw.\nThough Katerina Ivanovna tried to appear to be\ndisdainfully  unaware  of  it,  she  raised  her  voice\nand began at once (cid:24)(cid:24) speaking with conviction of\nSonia's  undoubted  ability  to  assist  her,  of  'her\ngentleness,  patience,  devotion,  generosity  and\ngood  education,'  tapping  Sonia  on  the  cheek\nand  kissing  her  warmly  twice.  Sonia  flushed\ncrimson, and Katerina Ivanovna suddenly burst\ninto  tears,  immediately  observing  that  she  was\n'nervous and silly, that she was too much upset,\nthat it was time to finish, and as the dinner was\nover, it was time to hand round the tea.'\nAt  that  moment,  Amalia  Ivanovna,  deeply\naggrieved at taking no part in the conversation,\nand not being listened to, made one last effort,", "and  with  secret  misgivings  ventured  on  an\nexceedingly deep and weighty observation, that\n'in the future boarding-school she would have to\npay particular attention to die Wäsche and that\nthere  certainly  must  be  a  good  dame  to  look\nafter  the  linen,  and  secondly  that  the  young\nladies must not novels at night read.'\nKaterina Ivanovna, who certainly was upset and\nvery tired, as well as heartily sick of the dinner,\nat once cut short Amalia Ivanovna, saying 'she\nknew  nothing  about  it  and  was  talking\nnonsense,  that  it  was  the  business  of  the\nlaundry  maid,  and  not  of  the  directress  of  a\nhigh-  class  boardingschool  to  look  after  die\nWäsche  and  as  for  novel-  reading,  that  was\nsimply  rudeness,  and  she  begged  her  to  be\nsilent.'  Amalia  Ivanovna  fired  up  and  getting\nangry observed that she only 'meant her good,'\nand  that  'she  had  meant  her  very  good,'  and\nthat 'it was long since she had paid her gold for\nthe lodgings.'\nKaterina  Ivanovna  at  once  'set  her  down,'\nsaying  that  it  was  a  lie  to  say  she  wished  her\ngood, because only yester(cid:24) day when her dead\nhusband  was  lying  on  the  table,  she  had", "worried  her  about  the  lodgings.  To  this  Amalia\nIvanovna  very  appropriately  observed  that  she\nhad  invited  those  ladies,  but  'those  ladies  had\nnot come, because those ladies are ladies and\ncannot  come  to  a  lady  who  is  not  a  lady.'\nKaterina  Ivanovna  at  once  pointed  out  to  her,\nthat as she was a slut she could not judge what\nmade  one  really  a  lady.  Amalia  Ivanovna  at\nonce declared that her 'Vater aus Berlin was a\nvery,  very  important  man,  and  both  hands  in\npockets  went,  and  always  used  to  say:  'Poof!\npoof!''  and  she  leapt  up  from  the  table  to\nrepresent  her  father,  sticking  her  hands  in  her\npockets, puffing her cheeks, and uttering vague\nsounds  resembling  'poof!  poof!'  amid  loud\nlaughter  from  all  the  lodgers,  who  purposely\nencouraged Amalia Ivanovna, hoping for a fight.\nBut  this  was  too  much  for  Katerina  Ivanovna,\nand she at once declared, so that all could hear,\nthat  Amalia  Ivanovna  probably  never  had  a\nfather,  but  was  simply  a  drunken  Petersburg\nFinn,  and  had  certainly  once  been  a  cook  and\nprobably  something  worse.  Amalia  Ivanovna\nturned  as  red  as  a  lobster  and  squealed  that\nperhaps Katerina Ivanovna never had a father,\n'but  she  had  a  Vater  aus  Berlin  and  that  he", "wore  a  long  coat  and  always  said\npoof-poof-poof!'\nKaterina  Ivanovna  observed  contemptuously\nthat  all  knew  what  her  family  was  and  that  on\nthat  very  certificate  of  honour  it  was  stated  in\nprint that her father was a colonel, while Amalia\nIvanovna's  father-if  she  really  had  one-was\nprobably  some  Finnish  milkman,  but  that\nprobably  she  never  had  a  father  at  all,  since  it\nwas  still  uncertain  whether  (cid:24)(cid:24)  her  name  was\nAmalia Ivanovna or Amalia Ludwigovna.\nAt  this  Amalia  Ivanovna,  lashed  to  fury,  struck\nthe  table  with  her  fist,  and  shrieked  that  she\nwas  Amalia  Ivanovna,  and  not  Ludwigovna,\n'that her Vater was named Johann and that he\nwas  a  burgomeister,  and  that  Katerina\nIvanovna's  Vater  was  quite  never  a\nburgomeister.' Katerina Ivanovna rose from her\nchair,  and  with  a  stern  and  apparently  calm\nvoice (though she was pale and her chest was\nheaving)  observed  that  'if  she  dared  for  one\nmoment  to  set  her  contemptible  wretch  of  a\nfather  on  a  level  with  her  papa,  she,  Katerina\nIvanovna, would tear her cap off her head and\ntrample  it  under  foot.'  Amalia  Ivanovna  ran", "about the room, shouting at the top of her voice,\nthat  she  was  mistress  of  the  house  and  that\nKaterina  Ivanovna  should  leave  the  lodgings\nthat minute; then she rushed for some reason to\ncollect  the  silver  spoons  from  the  table.  There\nwas  a  great  outcry  and  uproar,  the  children\nbegan  crying.  Sonia  ran  to  restrain  Katerina\nIvanovna,  but  when  Amalia  Ivanovna  shouted\nsomething  about  'the  yellow  ticket,'  Katerina\nIvanovna  pushed  Sonia  away,  and  rushed  at\nthe landlady to carry out her threat.\nAt  that  minute  the  door  opened,  and  Pyotr\nPetrovitch  Luzhin  appeared  on  the  threshold.\nHe  stood  scanning  the  party  with  severe  and\nvigilant eyes. Katerina Ivanovna rushed to him.(cid:24) ", "#$#$Chapter 33#$#$\n'Pyotr Petrovitch,' she cried, 'protect me ... you\nat  least!  Make  this  foolish  woman  understand\nthat  she  can't  behave  like  this  to  a  lady  in\nmisfortune  ...  that  there  is  a  law  for  such\nthings....  I'll  go  to  the  governor-general\nhimself....  She  shall  answer  for  it....\nRemembering  my  father's  hospitality  protect\nthese orphans.'\n'Allow  me,  madam....  Allow  me.'  Pyotr\nPetrovitch waved her off. 'Your papa as you are\nwell  aware  I  had  not  the  honour  of  knowing'\n(someone laughed aloud) 'and I do not intend to\ntake  part  in  your  everlasting  squabbles  with\nAmalia Ivanovna.... I have come here to speak\nof my own affairs ... and I want to have a word\nwith  your  stepdaughter,  Sofya  ...  Ivanovna,  I\nthink it is? Allow me to pass.'\nPyotr  Petrovitch,  edging  by  her,  went  to  the\nopposite corner where Sonia was.\nKaterina  Ivanovna  remained  standing  where", "she  was,  as  though  thunderstruck.  She  could\nnot understand how \nPyotr Petrovitch could deny having enjoyed her\nfather's  hospitility.  Though  she  had  invented  it\nherself,  she  believed  in  it  firmly  by  this  time.\nShe was struck too by the businesslike, dry and\neven  contemptuous  menacing  tone  of  Pyotr\nPetrovitch. All the clamour gradually died away\nat  his  entrance.  Not  only  was  this  'serious\nbusiness  man'  strikingly  incongruous  with  the\nrest of the party, but it was evident, (cid:24)(cid:24) too, that\nhe  had  come  upon  some  matter  of\nconsequence,  that  some  exceptional  cause\nmust  have  brought  him  and  that  therefore\nsomething  was  going  to  happen.  Raskolnikov,\nstanding  beside  Sonia,  moved  aside  to  let  him\npass;  Pyotr  Petrovitch  did  not  seem  to  notice\nhim.  A  minute  later  Lebeziatnikov,  too,\nappeared  in  the  doorway;  he  did  not  come  in,\nbut  stood  still,  listening  with  marked  interest,\nalmost  wonder,  and  seemed  for  a  time\nperplexed.\n'Excuse me for possibly interrupting you, but it's\na  matter  of  some  importance,'  Pyotr  Petrovitch\nobserved, addressing the company generally. 'I", "am  glad  indeed  to  find  other  persons  present.\nAmalia Ivanovna, I humbly beg you as mistress\nof  the  house  to  pay  careful  attention  to  what  I\nhave to say to Sofya Ivanovna. Sofya Ivanovna,'\nhe  went  on,  addressing  Sonia,  who  was  very\nmuch  surprised  and  already  alarmed,\n'immediately  after  your  visit  I  found  that  a\nhundred-rouble  note  was  missing  from  my\ntable,  in  the  room  of  my  friend  Mr.\nLebeziatnikov. If in any way whatever you know\nand will tell us where it is now, I assure you on\nmy  word  of  honour  and  call  all  present  to\nwitness  that  the  matter  shall  end  there.  In  the\nopposite  case  I  shall  be  compelled  to  have\nrecourse to very serious measures and then ...\nyou must blame yourself.'\nComplete silence reigned in the room. Even the\ncrying  children  were  still.  Sonia  stood  deadly\npale,  staring  at  Luzhin  and  unable  to  say  a\nword.  She  seemed  not  to  understand.  Some\nseconds passed.\n'Well,  how  is  it  to  be  then?'  asked  Luzhin,\nlooking intently at her.(cid:24)(cid:24)0 Crime and Punishment\n'I  don't  know....  I  know  nothing  about  it,'  Sonia\narticulated faintly at last.", "'No,  you  know  nothing?'  Luzhin  repeated  and\nagain  he  paused  for  some  seconds.  'Think  a\nmoment, mademoiselle,' he began severely, but\nstill, as it were, admonishing her. 'Reflect, I am\nprepared  to  give  you  time  for  consideration.\nKindly  observe  this:  if  I  were  not  so  entirely\nconvinced  I  should  not,  you  may  be  sure,  with\nmy  experience  venture  to  accuse  you  so\ndirectly.  Seeing  that  for  such  direct  accusation\nbefore  witnesses,  if  false  or  even  mistaken,  I\nshould  myself  in  a  certain  sense  be  made\nresponsible, I am aware of that. This morning I\nchanged  for  my  own  purposes  several\nfive-per-cent  securities  for  the  sum  of\napproximately  three  thousand  roubles.  The\naccount  is  noted  down  in  my  pocket-book.  On\nmy  return  home  I  proceeded  to  count  the\nmoney-as  Mr.  Lebeziatnikov  will  bear\nwitness-and  after  counting  two  thousand  three\nhundred  roubles  I  put  the  rest  in  my\npocket-book  in  my  coat  pocket.  About  five\nhundred  roubles  remained  on  the  table  and\namong  them  three  notes  of  a  hundred  roubles\neach.  At  that  moment  you  entered  (at  my\ninvitation)-and all the time you were present you\nwere  exceedingly  embarrassed;  so  that  three", "times  you  jumped  up  in  the  middle  of  the\nconversation  and  tried  to  make  off.  Mr.\nLebeziatnikov  can  bear  witness  to  this.  You\nyourself, mademoiselle, probably will not refuse\nto  confirm  my  statement  that  I  invited  you\nthrough  Mr.  Lebeziatnikov,  solely  in  order  to\ndiscuss  with  you  the  hopeless  and  destitute\nposition  of  your  relative,  Katerina  Ivanovna\n(whose dinner I was unable to attend), and the\nadvisability  of  getting  up  (cid:24)1  something  of  the\nnature  of  a  subscription,  lottery  or  the  like,  for\nher  benefit.  You  thanked  me  and  even  shed\ntears.  I  describe  all  this  as  it  took  place,\nprimarily  to  recall  it  to  your  mind  and  secondly\nto  show  you  that  not  the  slightest  detail  has\nescaped  my  recollection.  Then  I  took  a  ten-\nrouble note from the table and handed it to you\nby  way  of  first  instalment  on  my  part  for  the\nbenefit  of  your  relative.  Mr.  Lebeziatnikov  saw\nall  this.  Then  I  accompanied  you  to  the\ndoor-you  being  still  in  the  same  state  of\nembarrassment-after  which,  being  left  alone\nwith  Mr.  Lebeziatnikov  I  talked  to  him  for  ten\nminutes- then Mr. Lebeziatnikov went out and I\nreturned to the table with the money lying on it,\nintending  to  count  it  and  to  put  it  aside,  as  I\nproposed  doing  before.  To  my  surprise  one", "hundred-rouble  note  had  disappeared.  Kindly\nconsider  the  position.  Mr.  Lebeziatnikov  I\ncannot suspect. I am ashamed to allude to such\na supposition. I cannot have made a mistake in\nmy  reckoning,  for  the  minute  before  your\nentrance I had finished my accounts and found\nthe total correct. You will admit that recollecting\nyour  embarrassment,  your  eagerness  to  get\naway and the fact that you kept your hands for\nsome  time  on  the  table,  and  taking  into\nconsideration your social position and the habits\nassociated with it, I was, so to say, with horror\nand  positively  against  my  will,  compelled  to\nentertain  a  suspicion-a  cruel,  but  justifiable\nsuspicion!  I  will  add  further  and  repeat  that  in\nspite  of  my  positive  conviction,  I  realise  that  I\nrun a certain risk in making this accusation, but\nas you see, I could not let it pass. I have taken\naction  and  I  will  tell  you  why:  solely,  madam,\nsolely, owing to your black in(cid:24) gratitude! Why! I\ninvite  you  for  the  benefit  of  your  destitute\nrelative,  I  present  you  with  my  donation  of  ten\nroubles  and  you,  on  the  spot,  repay  me  for  all\nthat with such an action. It is too bad! You need\na lesson. Reflect! Moreover, like a true friend I\nbeg you- and you could have no better friend at\nthis  moment-think  what  you  are  doing,", "otherwise  I  shall  be  immovable!  Well,  what  do\nyou say?'\n'I  have  taken  nothing,'  Sonia  whispered  in\nterror, 'you gave me ten roubles, here it is, take\nit.'\nSonia pulled her handkerchief out of her pocket,\nuntied  a  corner  of  it,  took  out  the  ten-rouble\nnote and gave it to Luzhin.\n'And the hundred roubles you do not confess to\ntaking?' he insisted reproachfully, not taking the\nnote.\nSonia looked about her. All were looking at her\nwith  such  awful,  stern,  ironical,  hostile  eyes.\nShe looked at Raskolnikov ... he stood against\nthe  wall,  with  his  arms  crossed,  looking  at  her\nwith glowing eyes.\n'Good God!' broke from Sonia.\n'Amalia Ivanovna, we shall have to send word to\nthe  police  and  therefore  I  humbly  beg  you\nmeanwhile to send for the house porter,' Luzhin\nsaid softly and even kindly.", "'Gott  der  Barmherzige!  I  knew  she  was  the\nthief,'  cried  Amalia  Ivanovna,  throwing  up  her\nhands.\n'You  knew  it?'  Luzhin  caught  her  up,  'then  I\nsuppose  you  had  some  reason  before  this  for\nthinking so. I beg you, worthy Amalia Ivanovna,\nto  remember  your  words  which  have  been\nuttered before witnesses.'\nThere  was  a  buzz  of  loud  conversation  on  all\nsides. All (cid:24)(cid:24) were in movement.\n'What!'  cried  Katerina  Ivanovna,  suddenly\nrealising the position, and she rushed at Luzhin.\n'What! You accuse her of stealing? Sonia? Ah,\nthe wretches, the wretches!'\nAnd  running  to  Sonia  she  flung  her  wasted\narms round her and held her as in a vise.\n'Sonia!  how  dared  you  take  ten  roubles  from\nhim? Foolish girl! Give it to me! Give me the ten\nroubles at once-here!\nAnd  snatching  the  note  from  Sonia,  Katerina", "Ivanovna crumpled it up and flung it straight into\nLuzhin's face. It hit him in the eye and fell on the\nground. Amalia Ivanovna hastened to pick it up.\nPyotr Petrovitch lost his temper.\n'Hold that mad woman!' he shouted.\nAt that moment several other persons, besides\nLebeziatnikov, appeared in the doorway, among\nthem the two ladies.\n'What!  Mad?  Am  I  mad?  Idiot!'  shrieked\nKaterina  Ivanovna.  'You  are  an  idiot  yourself,\npettifogging  lawyer,  base  man!  Sonia,  Sonia\ntake his money! Sonia a thief! Why, she'd give\naway  her  last  penny!'  and  Katerina  Ivanovna\nbroke into hysterical laughter. 'Did you ever see\nsuch  an  idiot?'  she  turned  from  side  to  side.\n'And  you  too?'  she  suddenly  saw  the  landlady,\n'and  you  too,  sausage  eater,  you  declare  that\nshe is a thief, you trashy Prussian hen's leg in a\ncrinoline! She hasn't been out of this room: she\ncame  straight  from  you,  you  wretch,  and  sat\ndown  beside  me,  everyone  saw  her.  She  sat\nhere,  by  Rodion  Romanovitch.  Search  her!\nSince she's not left the room, the money would\nhave to be on her! Search her, search her! But", "if  you  don't  find  it,  then  (cid:24)  excuse  me,  my  dear\nfellow,  you'll  answer  for  it!  I'll  go  to  our\nSovereign,  to  our  Sovereign,  to  our  gracious\nTsar  himself,  and  throw  myself  at  his  feet,\nto-day,  this  minute!  I  am  alone  in  the  world!\nThey  would  let  me  in!  Do  you  think  they\nwouldn't? You're wrong, I will get in! I will get in!\nYou  reckoned  on  her  meekness!  You  relied\nupon  that!  But  I  am  not  so  submissive,  let  me\ntell  you!  You've  gone  too  far  yourself.  Search\nher, search her!'\nAnd Katerina Ivanovna in a frenzy shook Luzhin\nand dragged him towards Sonia.\n'I  am  ready,  I'll  be  responsible  ...  but  calm\nyourself,  madam,  calm  yourself.  I  see  that  you\nare  not  so  submissive!  ...  Well,  well,  but  as  to\nthat ...' Luzhin muttered, 'that ought to be before\nthe police ... though indeed there are witnesses\nenough as it is.... I am ready.... But in any case\nit's difficult for a man ... on account of her sex....\nBut with the help of Amalia Ivanovna ... though,\nof course, it's not the way to do things.... How is\nit to be done?'\n'As  you  will!  Let  anyone  who  likes  search  her!'", "cried  Katerina  Ivanovna.  'Sonia,  turn  out  your\npockets!  See!  Look,  monster,  the  pocket  is\nempty,  here  was  her  handkerchief!  Here  is  the\nother pocket, look! D'you see, d'you see?'\nAnd  Katerina  Ivanovna  turned-or  rather\nsnatched-both pockets inside out. But from the\nright  pocket  a  piece  of  paper  flew  out  and\ndescribing  a  parabola  in  the  air  fell  at  Luzhin's\nfeet.  Everyone  saw  it,  several  cried  out.  Pyotr\nPetrovitch  stooped  down,  picked  up  the  paper\nin two fingers, lifted it where all could see it and\nopened  it.  It  was  a  hundred-rouble  note  folded\nin  eight.  Pyotr  Petrovitch  held  (cid:24)(cid:24)  up  the  note\nshowing it to everyone.\n'Thief! Out of my lodging. Police, police!' yelled\nAmalia Ivanovna. 'They must to Siberia be sent!\nAway!'\nExclamations  arose  on  all  sides.  Raskolnikov\nwas  silent,  keeping  his  eyes  fixed  on  Sonia,\nexcept for an occasional rapid glance at Luzhin.\nSonia  stood  still,  as  though  unconscious.  She\nwas  hardly  able  to  feel  surprise.  Suddenly  the\ncolour  rushed  to  her  cheeks;  she  uttered  a  cry\nand hid her face in her hands.", "'No,  it  wasn't  I!  I  didn't  take  it!  I  know  nothing\nabout it,' she cried with a heartrending wail, and\nshe ran to Katerina Ivanovna, who clasped her\ntightly in her arms, as though she would shelter\nher from all the world.\n'Sonia! Sonia! I don't believe it! You see, I don't\nbelieve  it!'  she  cried  in  the  face  of  the  obvious\nfact,  swaying  her  to  and  fro  in  her  arms  like  a\nbaby,  kissing  her  face  continually,  then\nsnatching  at  her  hands  and  kissing  them,  too,\n'you  took  it!  How  stupid  these  people  are!  Oh\ndear!  You  are  fools,  fools,'  she  cried,\naddressing  the  whole  room,  'you  don't  know,\nyou don't know what a heart she has, what a girl\nshe is! She take it, she? She'd sell her last rag,\nshe'd  go  barefoot  to  help  you  if  you  needed  it,\nthat's what she is! She has the yellow passport\nbecause  my  children  were  starving,  she  sold\nherself  for  us!  Ah,  husband,  husband!  Do  you\nsee? Do you see? What a memorial dinner for\nyou! Merciful heavens! Defend her, why are you\nall  standing  still?  Rodion  Romanovitch,  why\ndon't  you  stand  up  for  her?  Do  you  believe  it,\ntoo? You are not worth her little finger, all of you\ntogether! Good God! Defend her now, at least!'(cid:24)", "The  wail  of  the  poor,  consumptive,  helpless \nwoman seemed to produce a great effect on her\naudience.  The  agonised,  wasted,  consumptive\nface, the parched blood-stained lips, the hoarse\nvoice,  the  tears  unrestrained  as  a  child's,  the\ntrustful,  childish  and  yet  despairing  prayer  for\nhelp  were  so  piteous  that  everyone  seemed  to\nfeel for her. Pyotr Petrovitch at any rate was at\nonce moved to compassion.\n'Madam,  madam,  this  incident  does  not  reflect\nupon you!' he cried impressively, 'no one would\ntake  upon  himself  to  accuse  you  of  being  an\ninstigator or even an accomplice in it, especially\nas you have proved her guilt by turning out her\npockets, showing that you had no previous idea\nof  it.  I  am  most  ready,  most  ready  to  show\ncompassion,  if  poverty,  so  to  speak,  drove\nSofya Semyonovna to it, but why did you refuse\nto  confess,  mademoiselle?  Were  you  afraid  of\nthe  disgrace?  The  first  step?  You  lost  your\nhead, perhaps? One can quite understand it....\nBut  how  could  you  have  lowered  yourself  to\nsuch an action? Gentlemen,' he addressed the\nwhole  company,  'gentlemen!  Compassionate\nand,  so  to  say,  commiserating  these  people,  I\nam ready to overlook it even now in spite of the", "personal insult lavished upon me! And may this\ndisgrace  be  a  lesson  to  you  for  the  future,'  he\nsaid,  addressing  Sonia,  'and  I  will  carry  the\nmatter no further. Enough!'\nPyotr  Petrovitch  stole  a  glance  at  Raskolnikov.\nTheir  eyes  met,  and  the  fire  in  Raskolnikov's\nseemed  ready  to  reduce  him  to  ashes.\nMeanwhile Katerina Ivanovna apparently heard\nnothing.  She  was  kissing  and  hugging  Sonia\nlike  a  madwoman.  The  children,  too,  were\nembracing  Sonia  on  all  (cid:24)(cid:24)  sides,  and\nPolenka-though  she  did  not  fully  understand\nwhat  was  wrong-was  drowned  in  tears  and\nshaking  with  sobs,  as  she  hid  her  pretty  little\nface,  swollen  with  weeping,  on  Sonia's\nshoulder.\n'How  vile!'  a  loud  voice  cried  suddenly  in  the\ndoorway.\nPyotr  Petrovitch  looked  round  quickly.'What \nvileness!'  Lebeziatnikov  repeated,  staring  him\nstraight in the face.\nPyotr Petrovitch gave a positive start-all noticed\nit  and  recalled  it  afterwards.  Lebeziatnikov", "strode into the room.\n'And you dared to call me as witness?' he said,\ngoing up to \nPyotr Petrovitch.\n'What  do  you  mean?  What  are  you  talking\nabout?' muttered Luzhin.\n'I mean that you ... are a slanderer, that's what\nmy  words  mean!'  Lebeziatnikov  said  hotly,\nlooking  sternly  at  him  with  his  short-  sighted\neyes.\nHe  was  extremely  angry.  Raskolnikov  gazed\nintently at him, as though seizing and weighing\neach word. Again there was a silence. \nPyotr  Petrovitch  indeed  seemed  almost\ndumbfounded for the first moment.\n'If  you  mean  that  for  me,  ...'  he  began,\nstammering.  'But  what's  the  matter  with  you?\nAre you out of your mind?'\n'I'm  in  my  mind,  but  you  are  a  scoundrel!  Ah,", "how vile! I have heard everything. I kept waiting\non  purpose  to  understand  it,  for  I  must  own\neven  now  it  is  not  quite  logical....  What  you\nhave done it all for I can't understand.'\n'Why, what have I done then? Give over talking\nin  your  nonsensical  riddles!  Or  maybe  you  are\ndrunk!'(cid:24)  'You  may  be  a  drunkard,  perhaps,  vile\nman, but I am not! I never touch vodka, for it's\nagainst  my  convictions.  Would  you  believe  it,\nhe, he himself, with his own hands gave Sofya\nSemyonovna that hundred-rouble note-I saw it,\nI was a witness, I'll take my oath! He did it, he!'\nrepeated Lebeziatnikov, addressing all.\n'Are you crazy, milksop?' squealed Luzhin. 'She\nis herself before you -she herself here declared\njust  now  before  everyone  that  I  gave  her  only\nten roubles. How could I have given it to her?'\n'I saw it, I saw it,' Lebeziatnikov repeated, 'and\nthough  it  is  against  my  principles,  I  am  ready\nthis very minute to take any oath you like before\nthe  court,  for  I  saw  how  you  slipped  it  in  her\npocket. Only like a fool I thought you did it out of\nkindness!  When  you  were  saying  good-bye  to\nher at the door, while you held her hand in one", "hand,  with  the  other,  the  left,  you  slipped  the\nnote into her pocket. I saw it, I saw it!'\nLuzhin turned pale.\n'What lies!' he cried impudently, 'why, how could\nyou, standing by the window, see the note? You\nfancied it with your short-sighted eyes. You are\nraving!'\n'No, I didn't fancy it. And though I was standing\nsome way off, I saw it all. And though it certainly\nwould  be  hard  to  distinguish  a  note  from  the\nwindow-that's true-I knew for certain that it was\na  hundred-rouble  note,  because,  when  you\nwere  going  to  give  Sofya  Semyonovna  ten\nroubles,  you  took  up  from  the  table  a\nhundred-rouble  note  (I  saw  it  because  I  was\nstanding near then, and an idea struck me at (cid:24)(cid:24)\nonce, so that I did not forget you had it in your\nhand). You folded it and kept it in your hand all\nthe time. I didn't think of it again until, when you\nwere getting up, you changed it from your right\nhand to your left and nearly dropped it! I noticed\nit because the same idea struck me again, that\nyou  meant  to  do  her  a  kindness  without  my\nseeing. You can fancy how I watched you and I", "saw  how  you  succeeded  in  slipping  it  into  her\npocket. I saw it, I saw it, I'll take my oath.'\nLebeziatnikov  was  almost  breathless.\nExclamations  arose  on  all  hands  chiefly\nexpressive of wonder, but some were menacing\nin  tone.  They  all  crowded  round  Pyotr\nPetrovitch. \nKaterina Ivanovna flew to Lebeziatnikov.\n'I was mistaken in you! Protect her! You are the\nonly  one  to  take  her  part!  She  is  an  orphan.\nGod has sent you!'\nKaterina  Ivanovna,  hardly  knowing  what  she\nwas doing, sank on her knees before him.\n'A  pack  of  nonsense!'  yelled  Luzhin,  roused  to\nfury,  'it's  all  nonsense  you've  been  talking!  'An\nidea  struck  you,  you  didn't  think,  you\nnoticed'-what does it amount to? So I gave it to\nher on the sly on purpose? What for? With what\nobject? What have I to do with this ...?'\n'What  for?  That's  what  I  can't  understand,  but\nthat  what  I  am  telling  you  is  the  fact,  that's", "certain!  So  far  from  my  being  mistaken,  you\ninfamous  criminal  man,  I  remember  how,  on\naccount  of  it,  a  question  occurred  to  me  at\nonce,  just  when  I  was  thanking  you  and\npressing  your  hand.  What  made  you  put  it\nsecretly in her pocket? Why you did it secretly, I\nmean? Could it be simply to conceal it from (cid:24)(cid:24)0\nCrime  and  Punishment  me,  knowing  that  my\nconvictions are opposed to yours and that I do\nnot  approve  of  private  benevolence,  which\neffects no radical cure? Well, I decided that you\nreally were ashamed of giving such a large sum\nbefore me. Perhaps, too, I thought, he wants to\ngive  her  a  surprise,  when  she  finds  a  whole\nhundred-rouble note in her pocket. (For I know,\nsome  benevolent  people  are  very  fond  of\ndecking out their charitable actions in that way.)\nThen  the  idea  struck  me,  too,  that  you  wanted\nto  test  her,  to  see  whether,  when  she  found  it,\nshe  would  come  to  thank  you.  Then,  too,  that\nyou  wanted  to  avoid  thanks  and  that,  as  the\nsaying  is,  your  right  hand  should  not  know  ...\nsomething  of  that  sort,  in  fact.  I  thought  of  so\nmany  possibilities  that  I  put  off  considering  it,\nbut  still  thought  it  indelicate  to  show  you  that  I\nknew  your  secret.  But  another  idea  struck  me\nagain that Sofya Semyonovna might easily lose", "the money before she noticed it, that was why I\ndecided  to  come  in  here  to  call  her  out  of  the\nroom  and  to  tell  her  that  you  put  a  hundred\nroubles in her pocket. But on my way I went first\nto  Madame  Kobilatnikov's  to  take  them  the\n'General  Treatise  on  the  Positive  Method'  and\nespecially  to  recommend  Piderit's  article  (and\nalso Wagner's); then I come on here and what a\nstate of things I find! Now could I, could I, have\nall these ideas and reflections if I had not seen\nyou put the hundredrouble note in her pocket?'\nWhen  Lebeziatnikov  finished  his  long-winded\nharangue with the logical deduction at the end,\nhe  was  quite  tired,  and  the  perspiration\nstreamed  from  his  face.  He  could  not,  alas,\neven  express  himself  correctly  in  Russian,\nthough  he  (cid:24)1  knew  no  other  language,  so  that\nhe was quite exhausted, almost emaciated after\nthis  heroic  exploit.  But  his  speech  produced  a\npowerful  effect.  He  had  spoken  with  such\nvehemence, with such conviction that everyone\nobviously believed him. Pyotr Petrovitch felt that\nthings were going badly with him.\n'What is it to do with me if silly ideas did occur\nto  you?'  he  shouted,  'that's  no  evidence.  You", "may have dreamt it, that's all! And I tell you, you\nare lying, sir. You are lying and slandering from\nsome  spite  against  me,  simply  from  pique,\nbecause I did not agree with your free-thinking,\ngodless, social propositions!'\nBut  this  retort  did  not  benefit  Pyotr  Petrovitch.\nMurmurs of disapproval were heard on all sides.\n'Ah,  that's  your  line  now,  is  it!'  cried\nLebeziatnikov,  'that's  nonsense!  Call  the  police\nand  I'll  take  my  oath!  There's  only  one  thing  I\ncan't  understand:  what  made  him  risk  such  a\ncontemptible  action.  Oh,  pitiful,  despicable\nman!'\n'I can explain why he risked such an action, and\nif necessary, I, too, will swear to it,' Raskolnikov\nsaid  at  last  in  a  firm  voice,  and  he  stepped\nforward.\nHe  appeared  to  be  firm  and  composed.\nEveryone felt clearly, from the very look of him\nthat he really knew about it and that the mystery\nwould be solved.\n'Now  I  can  explain  it  all  to  myself,'  said", "Raskolnikov,  addressing  Lebeziatnikov.  'From\nthe very beginning of the business, I suspected\nthat there was some scoundrelly intrigue at the\nbottom  of  it.  I  began  to  suspect  it  from  some\nspecial circumstances known to me only, which\nI will ex(cid:24) plain at once to everyone: they account\nfor  everything.  Your  valuable  evidence  has\nfinally made everything clear to me. I beg all, all\nto listen. This gentleman (he pointed to Luzhin)\nwas recently engaged to be married to a young\nlady-my  sister,  Avdotya  Romanovna\nRaskolnikov.  But  coming  to  Petersburg  he\nquarrelled with me, the day before yesterday, at\nour first meeting and I drove him out of my room\n-I  have  two  witnesses  to  prove  it.  He  is  a  very\nspiteful  man....  The  day  before  yesterday  I  did\nnot  know  that  he  was  staying  here,  in  your\nroom, and that consequently on the very day we\nquarrelled-the day before yesterday-he saw me\ngive  Katerina  Ivanovna  some  money  for  the\nfuneral, as a friend of the late Mr. Marmeladov.\nHe  at  once  wrote  a  note  to  my  mother  and\ninformed  her  that  I  had  given  away  all  my\nmoney,  not  to  Katerina  Ivanovna  but  to  Sofya\nSemyonovna,  and  referred  in  a  most\ncontemptible  way  to  the  ...  character  of  Sofya\nSemyonovna, that is, hinted at the character of", "my  attitude  to  Sofya  Semyonovna.  All  this  you\nunderstand  was  with  the  object  of  dividing  me\nfrom my mother and sister, by insinuating that I\nwas  squandering  on  unworthy  objects  the\nmoney which they had sent me and which was\nall  they  had.  Yesterday  evening,  before  my\nmother  and  sister  and  in  his  presence,  I\ndeclared that I had given the money to Katerina\nIvanovna  for  the  funeral  and  not  to  Sofya\nSemyonovna  and  that  I  had  no  acquaintance\nwith  Sofya  Semyonovna  and  had  never  seen\nher  before,  indeed.  At  the  same  time  I  added\nthat  he,  Pyotr  Petrovitch  Luzhin,  with  all  his\nvirtues,  was  not  worth  Sofya  Semyonovna's\nlittle finger, though he spoke so ill of her. To his\nquestion-would  I  (cid:24)(cid:24)  let  Sofya  Semyonovna  sit\ndown  beside  my  sister,  I  answered  that  I  had\nalready  done  so  that  day.  Irritated  that  my\nmother and sister were unwilling to quarrel with\nme  at  his  insinuations,  he  gradually  began\nbeing  unpardonably  rude  to  them.  A  final\nrupture took place and he was turned out of the\nhouse.  All  this  happened  yesterday  evening.\nNow I beg your special attention: consider: if he\nhad  now  succeeded  in  proving  that  Sofya\nSemyonovna was a thief, he would have shown\nto my mother and sister that he was almost right", "in  his  suspicions,  that  he  had  reason  to  be\nangry  at  my  putting  my  sister  on  a  level  with\nSofya  Semyonovna,  that,  in  attacking  me,  he\nwas protecting and preserving the honour of my\nsister,  his  betrothed.  In  fact  he  might  even,\nthrough all this, have been able to estrange me\nfrom  my  family,  and  no  doubt  he  hoped  to  be\nrestored  to  favour  with  them;  to  say  nothing  of\nrevenging himself on me personally, for he has\ngrounds  for  supposing  that  the  honour  and\nhappiness  of  Sofya  Semyonovna  are  very\nprecious to me. That was what he was working\nfor! That's how I understand it. That's the whole\nreason for it and there can be no other!'\nIt  was  like  this,  or  somewhat  like  this,  that\nRaskolnikov  wound  up  his  speech  which  was\nfollowed  very  attentively,  though  often\ninterrupted  by  exclamations  from  his  audience.\nBut  in  spite  of  interruptions  he  spoke  clearly,\ncalmly,  exactly,  firmly.  His  decisive  voice,  his\ntone  of  conviction  and  his  stern  face  made  a\ngreat impression on everyone.\n'Yes,  yes,  that's  it,'  Lebeziatnikov  assented\ngleefully,  'that  must  be  it,  for  he  asked  me,  as\nsoon  as  Sofya  Semyonovna  came  into  our", "room,  whether  you  were  here,  whether  I  had  (cid:24)\nseen  you  among  Katerina  Ivanovna's  guests.\nHe  called  me  aside  to  the  window  and  asked\nme  in  secret.  It  was  essential  for  him  that  you\nshould be here! That's it, that's it!'\nLuzhin  smiled  contemptuously  and  did  not\nspeak. But he was very pale. He seemed to be\ndeliberating  on  some  means  of  escape.\nPerhaps  he  would  have  been  glad  to  give  up\neverything and get away, but at the moment this\nwas  scarcely  possible.  It  would  have  implied\nadmitting  the  truth  of  the  accusations  brought\nagainst him. Moreover, the company, which had\nalready  been  excited  by  drink,  was  now  too\nmuch stirred to allow it. The commissariat clerk,\nthough  indeed  he  had  not  grasped  the  whole\nposition, was shouting louder than anyone and\nwas making some suggestions very unpleasant\nto Luzhin. But not all those present were drunk;\nlodgers  came  in  from  all  the  rooms.  The  three\nPoles  were  tremendously  excited  and  were\ncontinually  shouting  at  him:  'The  pan  is  a\nlajdak!'  and  muttering  threats  in  Polish.  Sonia\nhad  been  listening  with  strained  attention,\nthough  she  too  seemed  unable  to  grasp  it  all;\nshe seemed as though she had just returned to", "consciousness. She did not take her eyes off \nRaskolnikov,  feeling  that  all  her  safety  lay  in\nhim.  Katerina  Ivanovna  breathed  hard  and\npainfully  and  seemed  fearfully  exhausted.\nAmalia Ivanovna stood looking more stupid than\nanyone,  with  her  mouth  wide  open,  unable  to\nmake  out  what  had  happened.  She  only  saw\nthat  Pyotr  Petrovitch  had  somehow  come  to\ngrief.\nRaskolnikov was attempting to speak again, but\nthey  did  not  let  him.  Everyone  was  crowding\nround Luzhin with threats and shouts of abuse.\nBut  Pyotr  Petrovitch  was  not  (cid:24)(cid:24)  intimidated.\nSeeing  that  his  accusation  of  Sonia  had\ncompletely failed, he had recourse to insolence:\n'Allow me, gentlemen, allow me! Don't squeeze,\nlet  me  pass!'  he  said,  making  his  way  through\nthe  crowd.  'And  no  threats,  if  you  please!  I\nassure  you  it  will  be  useless,  you  will  gain\nnothing  by  it.  On  the  contrary,  you'll  have  to\nanswer, gentlemen, for violently obstructing the\ncourse of justice. The thief has been more than\nunmasked,  and  I  shall  prosecute.  Our  judges\nare not so blind and ... not so drunk, and will not", "believe  the  testimony  of  two  notorious  infidels,\nagitators,  and  atheists,  who  accuse  me  from\nmotives  of  personal  revenge  which  they  are\nfoolish  enough  to  admit....  Yes,  allow  me  to\npass!'\n'Don't  let  me  find  a  trace  of  you  in  my  room!\nKindly  leave  at  once,  and  everything  is  at  an\nend between us! When I think of the trouble I've\nbeen taking, the way I've been expounding ... all\nthis fortnight!'\n'I told you myself to-day that I was going, when\nyou tried to keep me; now I will simply add that\nyou are a fool. I advise you to see a doctor for\nyour  brains  and  your  short  sight.  Let  me  pass,\ngentlemen!'\nHe  forced  his  way  through.  But  the\ncommissariat  clerk  was  unwilling  to  let  him  off\nso  easily:  he  picked  up  a  glass  from  the  table,\nbrandished  it  in  the  air  and  flung  it  at  Pyotr\nPetrovitch; but the glass flew straight at Amalia\nIvanovna.  She  screamed,  and  the  clerk,\noverbalancing, fell heavily under the table. Pyotr\nPetrovitch made his way to his room and half an\nhour  later  had  left  the  house.  Sonia,  timid  by", "nature,  had  felt  before  that  day  that  she  could\nbe  ill-  treated  (cid:24)  more  easily  than  anyone,  and\nthat she could be wronged with impunity. Yet till\nthat  moment  she  had  fancied  that  she  might\nescape  misfortune  by  care,  gentleness  and\nsubmissiveness  before  everyone.  Her\ndisappointment  was  too  great.  She  could,  of\ncourse,  bear  with  patience  and  almost  without\nmurmur  anything,  even  this.  But  for  the  first\nminute  she  felt  it  too  bitter.  In  spite  of  her\ntriumph and her justification-when her first terror\nand  stupefaction  had  passed  and  she  could\nunderstand  it  all  clearly-the  feeling  of  her\nhelplessness  and  of  the  wrong  done  to  her\nmade her heart throb with anguish and she was\novercome  with  hysterical  weeping.  At  last,\nunable to bear any more, she rushed out of the\nroom  and  ran  home,  almost  immediately  after\nLuzhin's  departure.  When  amidst  loud  laughter\nthe glass flew at Amalia Ivanovna, it was more\nthan  the  landlady  could  endure.  With  a  shriek\nshe  rushed  like  a  fury  at  Katerina  Ivanovna,\nconsidering her to blame for everything.\n'Out of my lodgings! At once! Quick march!'\nAnd  with  these  words  she  began  snatching  up", "everything  she  could  lay  her  hands  on  that\nbelonged to Katerina Ivanovna, and throwing it\non  the  floor.  Katerina  Ivanovna,  pale,  almost\nfainting, and gasping for breath, jumped up from\nthe bed where she had sunk in exhaustion and\ndarted  at  Amalia  Ivanovna.  But  the  battle  was\ntoo unequal: the landlady waved her away like a\nfeather.\n'What! As though that godless calumny was not\nenough-this vile creature attacks me! What! On\nthe day of my husband's funeral I am turned out\nof  my  lodging!  After  eating  my  bread  and  salt\nshe turns me into the street, with my (cid:24)(cid:24) orphans!\nWhere  am  I  to  go?'  wailed  the  poor  woman,\nsobbing  and  gasping.  'Good  God!'  she  cried\nwith  flashing  eyes,  'is  there  no  justice  upon\nearth?  Whom  should  you  protect  if  not  us\norphans? We shall see! There is law and justice\non  earth,  there  is,  I  will  find  it!  Wait  a  bit,\ngodless  creature!  Polenka,  stay  with  the\nchildren, I'll come back. Wait for me, if you have\nto wait in the street. We will see whether there\nis justice on earth!'\nAnd  throwing  over  her  head  that  green  shawl\nwhich  Marmeladov    had    mentioned    to ", "Raskolnikov,    Katerina  Ivanovna  squeezed  her\nway  through  the  disorderly  and  drunken  crowd\nof lodgers who still filled the room, and, wailing\nand tearful, she ran into the street-with a vague\nintention  of  going  at  once  somewhere  to  find\njustice.  Polenka  with  the  two  little  ones  in  her\narms  crouched,  terrified,  on  the  trunk  in  the\ncorner of the room, where she waited trembling\nfor  her  mother  to  come  back.  Amalia  Ivanovna\nraged about the room, shrieking, lamenting and\nthrowing  everything  she  came  across  on  the\nfloor.  The  lodgers  talked  incoherently,  some\ncommented  to  the  best  of  their  ability  on  what\nhad  happened,  others  quarrelled  and  swore  at\none another, while others struck up a song....\n'Now  it's  time  for  me  to  go,'  thought\nRaskolnikov.  'Well,  Sofya  Semyonovna,  we\nshall see what you'll say now!'\nAnd  he  set  off  in  the  direction  of  Sonia's\nlodgings.(cid:24) ", "#$#$Chapter 34#$#$\nRaskolnikov  had  been  a  vigorous  and  active\nchampion \nof Sonia against Luzhin, although he had such\na  load  of  horror  and  anguish  in  his  own  heart.\nBut  having  gone  through  so  much  in  the\nmorning, he found a sort of relief in a change of\nsensations,  apart  from  the  strong  personal\nfeeling which impelled him to defend Sonia. He\nwas agitated too, especially at some moments,\nby the thought of his approaching interview with\nSonia:  he  had  to  tell  her  who  had  killed\nLizaveta. He knew the terrible suffering it would\nbe  to  him  and,  as  it  were,  brushed  away  the\nthought  of  it.  So  when  he  cried  as  he  left\nKaterina Ivanovna's, 'Well, Sofya Semyonovna,\nwe  shall  see  what  you'll  say  now!'  he  was  still\nsuperficially  excited,  still  vigorous  and  defiant\nfrom  his  triumph  over  Luzhin.  But,  strange  to\nsay, by the time he reached Sonia's lodging, he\nfelt a sudden impotence and fear. He stood still\nin  hesitation  at  the  door,  asking  himself  the\nstrange  question:  'Must  he  tell  her  who  killed", "Lizaveta?' It was a strange question because he\nfelt  at  the  very  time  not  only  that  he  could  not\nhelp telling her, but also that he could not put off\nthe telling. He did not yet know why it must be\nso, he only felt it, and the agonising sense of his\nimpotence before the inevitable almost crushed\nhim. To cut short his hesitation and suffering, he\nquickly  opened  the  door  and  looked  at  Sonia\nfrom  the  doorway.  She  was  sitting  with  her  (cid:24)(cid:24)\nelbows on the table and her face in her hands,\nbut seeing \nRaskolnikov  she  got  up  at  once  and  came  to\nmeet him as though she were expecting him.\n'What  would  have  become  of  me  but  for  you?'\nshe  said  quickly,  meeting  him  in  the  middle  of\nthe room.\nEvidently she was in haste to say this to him. It\nwas what she had been waiting for.\nRaskolnikov went to the table and sat down on\nthe  chair  from  which  she  had  only  just  risen.\nShe  stood  facing  him,  two  steps  away,  just  as\nshe had done the day before.", "'Well,  Sonia?'  he  said,  and  felt  that  his  voice\nwas  trembling,  'it  was  all  due  to  'your  social\nposition  and  the  habits  associated  with  it.'  Did\nyou understand that just now?'\nHer face showed her distress.\n'Only don't talk to me as you did yesterday,' she\ninterrupted him. 'Please don't begin it. There is\nmisery enough without that.'\nShe  made  haste  to  smile,  afraid  that  he  might\nnot like the reproach.\n'I  was  silly  to  come  away  from  there.  What  is\nhappening  there  now?  I  wanted  to  go  back\ndirectly,  but  I  kept  thinking  that  ...  you  would\ncome.'\nHe  told  her  that  Amalia  Ivanovna  was  turning\nthem  out  of  their  lodging  and  that  Katerina\nIvanovna  had  run  off  somewhere  'to  seek\njustice.'\n'My God!' cried Sonia, 'let's go at once....'\nAnd she snatched up her cape.", "'It's  everlastingly  the  same  thing!'  said\nRaskolnikov, irritably. 'You've no thought except\nfor  them!  Stay  a  little  with  (cid:24)(cid:24)0  Crime  and\nPunishment me.'\n'But ... Katerina Ivanovna?'\n'You won't lose Katerina Ivanovna, you may be\nsure,  she'll  come  to  you  herself  since  she  has\nrun out,' he added peevishly. 'If she doesn't find\nyou here, you'll be blamed for it....'\nSonia  sat  down  in  painful  suspense.\nRaskolnikov was silent, gazing at the floor and\ndeliberating.\n'This time Luzhin did not want to prosecute you,'\nhe  began,  not  looking  at  Sonia,  'but  if  he  had\nwanted  to,  if  it  had  suited  his  plans,  he  would\nhave  sent  you  to  prison  if  it  had  not  been  for\nLebeziatnikov and me. Ah?'\n'Yes,'  she  assented  in  a  faint  voice.  'Yes,'  she\nrepeated, preoccupied and distressed.\n'But  I  might  easily  not  have  been  there.  And  it", "was  quite  an  accident  Lebeziatnikov's  turning\nup.'\nSonia was silent.\n'And if you'd gone to prison, what then? Do you\nremember what I said yesterday?'\nAgain she did not answer. He waited.\n'I thought you would cry out again 'don't speak\nof  it,  leave  off.''  Raskolnikov  gave  a  laugh,  but\nrather  a  forced  one.  'What,  silence  again?'  he\nasked  a  minute  later.  'We  must  talk  about\nsomething, you know. It would be interesting for\nme  to  know  how  you  would  decide  a  certain\n'problem' as Lebeziatnikov would say.' (He was\nbeginning  to  lose  the  thread.)  'No,  really,  I  am\nserious. Imagine, Sonia, that you had known all\nLuzhin's  intentions  beforehand.  Known,  that  is,\nfor a fact, that they would be the ruin of Katerina\n(cid:24)1  Ivanovna  and  the  children  and  yourself\nthrown  in-since  you  don't  count  yourself  for\nanything-Polenka  too  ...  for  she'll  go  the  same\nway.  Well,  if  suddenly  it  all  depended  on  your\ndecision whether he or they should go on living,\nthat  is  whether  Luzhin  should  go  on  living  and", "doing  wicked  things,  or  Katerina  Ivanovna\nshould  die?  How  would  you  decide  which  of\nthem was to die? I ask you?'\nSonia  looked  uneasily  at  him.  There  was\nsomething  peculiar  in  this  hesitating  question,\nwhich  seemed  approaching  something  in  a\nroundabout way.\n'I felt that you were going to ask some question\nlike that,' she said, looking inquisitively at him.\n'I  dare  say  you  did.  But  how  is  it  to  be\nanswered?'\n'Why do you ask about what could not happen?'\nsaid Sonia reluctantly.\n'Then  it  would  be  better  for  Luzhin  to  go  on\nliving  and  doing  wicked  things?  You  haven't\ndared to decide even that!'\n'But  I  can't  know  the  Divine  Providence....  And\nwhy  do  you  ask  what  can't  be  answered?\nWhat's the use of such foolish questions? How\ncould  it  happen  that  it  should  depend  on  my\ndecision-who  has  made  me  a  judge  to  decide", "who is to live and who is not to live?'\n'Oh, if the Divine Providence is to be mixed up\nin  it,  there  is  no  doing  anything,'  Raskolnikov\ngrumbled morosely.\n'You'd  better  say  straight  out  what  you  want!'\nSonia  cried  in  distress.  'You  are  leading  up  to\nsomething again.... Can you have come simply\nto torture me?'\nShe could not control herself and began crying\nbitterly. He looked at her in gloomy misery. Five\nminutes passed.(cid:24) 'Of course you're right, Sonia,'\nhe  said  softly  at  last.  He  was  suddenly\nchanged.  His  tone  of  assumed  arrogance  and\nhelpless  defiance  was  gone.  Even  his  voice\nwas suddenly weak. 'I told you yesterday that I\nwas  not  coming  to  ask  forgiveness  and  almost\nthe first thing I've said is to ask forgiveness.... I\nsaid  that  about  Luzhin  and  Providence  for  my\nown sake. I was asking forgiveness, Sonia....'\nHe  tried  to  smile,  but  there  was  something\nhelpless  and  incomplete  in  his  pale  smile.  He\nbowed his head and hid his face in his hands.", "And suddenly a strange, surprising sensation of\na sort of bitter hatred for Sonia passed through\nhis  heart.  As  it  were  wondering  and  frightened\nof this sensation, he raised his head and looked\nintently  at  her;  but  he  met  her  uneasy  and\npainfully  anxious  eyes  fixed  on  him;  there  was\nlove  in  them;  his  hatred  vanished  like  a\nphantom.  It  was  not  the  real  feeling;  he  had\ntaken the one feeling for the other. It only meant\nthat that minute had come.\nHe  hid  his  face  in  his  hands  again  and  bowed\nhis head. Suddenly he turned pale, got up from\nhis chair, looked at Sonia, and without uttering a\nword sat down mechanically on her bed.\nHis  sensations  that  moment  were  terribly  like\nthe  moment  when  he  had  stood  over  the  old\nwoman with the axe in his hand and felt that 'he\nmust not lose another minute.'\n'What's  the  matter?'  asked  Sonia,  dreadfully\nfrightened.\nHe  could  not  utter  a  word.  This  was  not  at  all,\nnot  at  all  the  way  he  had  intended  to  'tell'  and\nhe  did  not  understand  what  was  happening  to", "him now. She went up to him, softly, (cid:24)(cid:24) sat down\non  the  bed  beside  him  and  waited,  not  taking\nher eyes off him. Her heart throbbed and sank.\nIt  was  unendurable;  he  turned  his  deadly  pale\nface  to  her.  His  lips  worked,  helplessly\nstruggling  to  utter  something.  A  pang  of  terror\npassed through Sonia's heart.\n'What's  the  matter?'  she  repeated,  drawing  a\nlittle away from him.\n'Nothing,  Sonia,  don't  be  frightened....  It's\nnonsense.  It  really  is  nonsense,  if  you  think  of\nit,'  he  muttered,  like  a  man  in  delirium.  'Why\nhave  I  come  to  torture  you?'  he  added\nsuddenly,  looking  at  her.  'Why,  really?  I  keep\nasking  myself  that  question,  Sonia....'He    had \nperhaps  been  asking  himself  that  question a\nquarter  of  an  hour  before,  but  now  he  spoke\nhelplessly,  hardly  knowing  what  he  said  and\nfeeling a continual tremor all over.\n'Oh,  how  you  are  suffering!'  she  muttered  in\ndistress, looking intently at him.\n'It's all nonsense.... Listen, Sonia.' He suddenly\nsmiled,  a  pale  helpless  smile  for  two  seconds.", "'You  remember  what  I  meant  to  tell  you\nyesterday?'\nSonia waited uneasily.\n'I said as I went away that perhaps I was saying\ngood-bye  for  ever,  but  that  if  I  came  to-day  I\nwould tell you who ... who killed Lizaveta.'\nShe began trembling all over.\n'Well, here I've come to tell you.'\n'Then  you  really  meant  it  yesterday?'  she\nwhispered  with  difficulty.  'How  do  you  know?'\nshe  asked  quickly,  as  though  (cid:24)  suddenly\nregaining her reason.\nSonia's  face  grew  paler  and  paler,  and  she\nbreathed painfully.\n'I know.'\nShe paused a minute.\n'Have they found him?' she asked timidly.'No.'", "'Then  how  do  you  know  about  it?'  she  asked\nagain, hardly audibly and again after a minute's\npause.\nHe turned to her and looked very intently at her.\n'Guess,'  he  said,  with  the  same  distorted\nhelpless smile.\nA shudder passed over her.\n'But  you  ...  why  do  you  frighten  me  like  this?'\nshe said, smiling like a child.\n'I must be a great friend of his ... since I know,'\nRaskolnikov  went  on,  still  gazing  into  her  face,\nas though he could not turn his eyes away. 'He\n...  did  not  mean  to  kill  that  Lizaveta  ...  he  ...\nkilled her accidentally.... He meant to kill the old\nwoman when she was alone and he went there\n...  and  then  Lizaveta  came  in  ...  he  killed  her\ntoo.'\nAnother awful moment passed. Both still gazed\nat one another.\n'You  can't  guess,  then?'  he  asked  suddenly,", "feeling as though he were flinging himself down\nfrom a steeple.\n'N-no ...' whispered Sonia.\n'Take a good look.'\nAs  soon  as  he  had  said  this  again,  the  same\nfamiliar sensation froze his heart. He looked at\nher  and  all  at  once  seemed  to  see  in  her  face\nthe face of Lizaveta. He remem-(cid:24)(cid:24) bered clearly\nthe  expression  in  Lizaveta's  face,  when  he\napproached  her  with  the  axe  and  she  stepped\nback  to  the  wall,  putting  out  her  hand,  with\nchildish  terror  in  her  face,  looking  as  little\nchildren do when they begin to be frightened of\nsomething, looking intently and uneasily at what\nfrightens  them,  shrinking  back  and  holding  out\ntheir  little  hands  on  the  point  of  crying.  Almost\nthe  same  thing  happened  now  to  Sonia.  With\nthe  same  helplessness  and  the  same  terror,\nshe  looked  at  him  for  a  while  and,  suddenly\nputting  out  her  left  hand,  pressed  her  fingers\nfaintly  against  his  breast  and  slowly  began  to\nget  up  from  the  bed,  moving  further  from  him\nand  keeping  her  eyes  fixed  even  more\nimmovably on him. Her terror infected him. The", "same  fear  showed  itself  on  his  face.  In  the\nsame way he stared at her and almost with the\nsame childish smile.\n'Have you guessed?' he whispered at last.\n'Good  God!'  broke  in  an  awful  wail  from  her\nbosom.\nShe sank helplessly on the bed with her face in\nthe  pillows,  but  a  moment  later  she  got  up,\nmoved  quickly  to  him,  seized  both  his  hands\nand,  gripping  them  tight  in  her  thin  fingers,\nbegan looking into his face again with the same\nintent stare. In this last desperate look she tried\nto look into him and catch some last hope. But\nthere  was  no  hope;  there  was  no  doubt\nremaining;  it  was  all  true!  Later  on,  indeed,\nwhen  she  recalled  that  moment,  she  thought  it\nstrange  and  wondered  why  she  had  seen  at\nonce  that  there  was  no  doubt.  She  could  not\nhave  said,  for  instance,  that  she  had  foreseen\nsomething of the sort-and yet now, as soon as\nhe told her, she suddenly fancied that she had\nreally foreseen this very (cid:24) thing.\n'Stop,  Sonia,  enough!  don't  torture  me,'  he", "begged her miserably.\nIt  was  not  at  all,  not  at  all  like  this  he  had\nthought  of  telling  her,  but  this  is  how  it\nhappened.\nShe jumped up, seeming not to know what she\nwas doing, and, wringing her hands, walked into\nthe  middle  of  the  room;  but  quickly  went  back\nand  sat  down  again  beside  him,  her  shoulder\nalmost touching his. All of a sudden she started\nas though she had been stabbed, uttered a cry\nand  fell  on  her  knees  before  him,  she  did  not\nknow why.\n'What  have  you  done-what  have  you  done  to\nyourself?' she said in despair, and, jumping up,\nshe  flung  herself  on  his  neck,  threw  her  arms\nround him, and held him tightly.\nRaskolnikov drew back and looked at her with a\nmournful smile.\n'You are a strange girl, Sonia-you kiss me and\nhug me when I tell you about that.... You don't\nthink what you are doing.'", "'There is no one-no one in the whole world now\nso  unhappy  as  you!'  she  cried  in  a  frenzy,  not\nhearing  what  he  said,  and  she  suddenly  broke\ninto violent hysterical weeping.\nA  feeling  long  unfamiliar  to  him  flooded  his\nheart  and  softened  it  at  once.  He  did  not\nstruggle  against  it.  Two  tears  started  into  his\neyes and hung on his eyelashes.\n'Then  you  won't  leave  me,  Sonia?'  he  said,\nlooking at her almost with hope.\n'No,  no,  never,  nowhere!'  cried  Sonia.  'I  will\nfollow  you,  I  (cid:24)(cid:24)  will  follow  you  everywhere.  Oh,\nmy God! Oh, how miserable I am! ... Why, why\ndidn't  I  know  you  before!  Why  didn't  you  come\nbefore? Oh, dear!'\n'Here I have come.'\n'Yes, now! What's to be done now? ... Together,\ntogether!'  she  repeated  as  it  were\nunconsciously,  and  she  hugged  him  again.  'I'll\nfollow you to Siberia!'\nHe recoiled at this, and the same hostile, almost", "haughty smile came to his lips.\n'Perhaps  I  don't  want  to  go  to  Siberia  yet,\nSonia,' he said.\nSonia  looked  at  him  quickly.Again    after    her \nfirst    passionate,    agonising    sympathy  for  the\nunhappy  man  the  terrible  idea  of  the  murder\noverwhelmed  her.  In  his  changed  tone  she\nseemed  to  hear  the  murderer  speaking.  She\nlooked at him bewildered. She knew nothing as\nyet,  why,  how,  with  what  object  it  had  been.\nNow all these questions rushed at once into her\nmind.  And  again  she  could  not  believe  it:  'He,\nhe is a murderer! Could it be true?'\n'What's  the  meaning  of  it?  Where  am  I?'  she\nsaid  in  complete  bewilderment,  as  though  still\nunable to recover herself. 'How could you, you,\na man like you.... How could you bring yourself\nto it? ... What does it mean?'\n'Oh,  well-to  plunder.  Leave  off,  Sonia,'  he\nanswered wearily, almost with vexation.\nSonia  stood  as  though  struck  dumb,  but\nsuddenly she cried:", "'You  were  hungry!  It  was  ...  to  help  your\nmother? Yes?'\n'No, Sonia, no,' he muttered, turning away and\nhanging  (cid:24)  his  head.  'I  was  not  so  hungry....  I\ncertainly  did  want  to  help  my  mother,  but  ...\nthat's  not  the  real  thing  either....  Don't  torture\nme, Sonia.'\nSonia clasped her hands.\n'Could it, could it all be true? Good God, what a\ntruth! Who could believe it? And how could you\ngive  away  your  last  farthing  and  yet  rob  and\nmurder!  Ah,'  she  cried  suddenly,  'that  money\nyou  gave  Katerina  Ivanovna  ...  that  money....\nCan that money ...'\n'No,  Sonia,'  he  broke  in  hurriedly,  'that  money\nwas not it. Don't worry yourself! That money my\nmother sent me and it came when I was ill, the\nday  I  gave  it  to  you....  Razumihin  saw  it  ...  he\nreceived it for me.... That money was mine-my\nown.'\nSonia  listened  to  him  in  bewilderment  and  did", "her utmost to comprehend.\n'And  that  money....  I  don't  even  know  really\nwhether there was any money,' he added softly,\nas though reflecting. 'I took a purse off her neck,\nmade of chamois leather ... a purse stuffed full\nof something ... but I didn't look in it; I suppose I\nhadn't  time....  And  the  things-chains  and\ntrinkets-I  buried  under  a  stone  with  the  purse\nnext  morning  in  a  yard  off  the  V--  Prospect.\nThey are all there now.... .'\nSonia strained every nerve to listen.\n'Then why ... why, you said you did it to rob, but\nyou  took  nothing?'  she  asked  quickly,  catching\nat a straw.\n'I don't know.... I haven't yet decided whether to\ntake that money or not,' he said, musing again;\nand, seeming to wake up with a start, he gave a\nbrief ironical smile. 'Ach, what silly (cid:24)(cid:24) stuff I am\ntalking, eh?'\nThe  thought  flashed  through  Sonia's  mind,\nwasn't  he  mad?  But  she  dismissed  it  at  once.\n'No,  it  was  something  else.'  She  could  make", "nothing of it, nothing.\n'Do  you  know,  Sonia,'  he  said  suddenly  with\nconviction,  'let  me  tell  you:  if  I'd  simply  killed\nbecause  I  was  hungry,'  laying  stress  on  every\nword and looking enigmatically but sincerely at\nher, 'I should be happy now. You must believe\nthat!  What  would  it  matter  to  you,'  he  cried  a\nmoment later with a sort of despair, 'what would\nit  matter  to  you  if  I  were  to  confess  that  I  did\nwrong?  What  do  you  gain  by  such  a  stupid\ntriumph over me? Ah, Sonia, was it for that I've\ncome to you to-day?'\nAgain Sonia tried to say something, but did not\nspeak.\n'I  asked  you  to  go  with  me  yesterday  because\nyou are all I have left.'\n'Go where?' asked Sonia timidly.\n'Not  to  steal  and  not  to  murder,  don't  be\nanxious,'  he  smiled  bitterly.  'We  are  so\ndifferent.... And you know, Sonia, it's only now,\nonly  this  moment  that  I  understand  where  I\nasked  you  to  go  with  me  yesterday!  Yesterday", "when I said it I did not know where. I asked you\nfor one thing, I came to you for one thing-not to\nleave me. You won't leave me, Sonia?'\nShe squeezed his hand.\n'And  why,  why  did  I  tell  her?  Why  did  I  let  her\nknow?'  he  cried  a  minute  later  in  despair,\nlooking  with  infinite  anguish  at  her.  'Here  you\nexpect an explanation from me, Sonia; you are\nsitting and waiting for it, I see that. But what (cid:24)(cid:24)0\nCrime and Punishment can I tell you? You won't\nunderstand and will only suffer misery ... on my\naccount!  Well,  you  are  crying  and  embracing\nme again. Why do you do it? Because I couldn't\nbear  my  burden  and  have  come  to  throw  it  on\nanother:  you  suffer  too,  and  I  shall  feel  better!\nAnd can you love such a mean wretch?'\n'But aren't you suffering, too?' cried Sonia.\nAgain  a  wave  of  the  same  feeling  surged  into\nhis heart, and again for an instant softened it.\n'Sonia, I have a bad heart, take note of that. It\nmay explain a great deal. I have come because\nI  am  bad.  There  are  men  who  wouldn't  have", "come. But I am a coward and ... a mean wretch.\nBut  ...  never  mind!  That's  not  the  point.  I  must\nspeak now, but I don't know how to begin.'\nHe paused and sank into thought.\n'Ach,  we  are  so  different,'  he  cried  again,  'we\nare not alike. And why, why did I come? I shall\nnever forgive myself that.'\n'No,  no,  it  was  a  good  thing  you  came,'  cried\nSonia. 'It's better I should know, far better!'\nHe looked at her with anguish.\n'What if it were really that?' he said, as though\nreaching a conclusion. 'Yes, that's what it was! I\nwanted  to  become  a  Napoleon,  that  is  why  I\nkilled her.... Do you understand now?'\n'N-no,'  Sonia  whispered  naïvely  and  timidly.\n'Only  speak,  speak,  I  shall  understand,  I  shall\nunderstand in myself!' she kept begging him.\n'You'll understand? Very well, we shall see!' He\npaused  and  was  for  some  time  lost  in\nmeditation.(cid:24)1 'It was like this: I asked myself one", "day this question-what if Napoleon, for instance,\nhad happened to be in my place, and if he had\nnot  had  Toulon  nor  Egypt  nor  the  passage  of\nMont Blanc to begin his career with, but instead\nof all those picturesque and monumental things,\nthere had simply been some ridiculous old hag,\na  pawnbroker,  who  had  to  be  murdered  too  to\nget  money  from  her  trunk  (for  his  career,  you\nunderstand).  Well,  would  he  have  brought\nhimself  to  that  if  there  had  been  no  other\nmeans?  Wouldn't  he  have  felt  a  pang  at  its\nbeing so far from monumental and ... and sinful,\ntoo?  Well,  I  must  tell  you  that  I  worried  myself\nfearfully  over  that  'question'  so  that  I  was\nawfully ashamed when I guessed at last (all of a\nsudden, somehow) that it would not have given\nhim the least pang, that it would not even have\nstruck him that it was not monumental ... that he\nwould not have seen that there was anything in\nit to pause over, and that, if he had had no other\nway,  he  would  have  strangled  her  in  a  minute\nwithout  thinking  about  it!  Well,  I  too  ...  left  off\nthinking  about  it  ...  murdered  her,  following  his\nexample. And that's exactly how it was! Do you\nthink it funny? Yes, Sonia, the funniest thing of\nall is that perhaps that's just how it was.'", "Sonia did not think it at all funny.\n'You  had  better  tell  me  straight  out  ...  without\nexamples,'  she  begged,  still  more  timidly  and\nscarcely audibly.\nHe turned to her, looked sadly at her and took\nher hands.\n'You are right again, Sonia. Of course that's all\nnonsense,  it's  almost  all  talk!  You  see,  you\nknow  of  course  that  my  (cid:24)  mother  has  scarcely\nanything,  my  sister  happened  to  have  a  good\neducation and was condemned to drudge as a\ngoverness.  All  their  hopes  were  centered  on\nme. I was a student, but I couldn't keep myself\nat  the  university  and  was  forced  for  a  time  to\nleave it. Even if I had lingered on like that, in ten\nor  twelve  years  I  might  (with  luck)  hope  to  be\nsome sort of teacher or clerk with a salary of a\nthousand  roubles'  (he  repeated  it  as  though  it\nwere  a  lesson)  'and  by  that  time  my  mother\nwould be worn out with grief and anxiety and I\ncould  not  succeed  in  keeping  her  in  comfort\nwhile  my  sister  ...  well,  my  sister  might  well\nhave fared worse! And it's a hard thing to pass\neverything  by  all  one's  life,  to  turn  one's  back", "upon  everything,  to  forget  one's  mother  and\ndecorously  accept  the  insults  inflicted  on  one's\nsister.  Why  should  one?  When  one  has  buried\nthem  to  burden  oneself  with  others-wife  and\nchildren-and  to  leave  them  again  without  a\nfarthing?  So  I  resolved  to  gain  possession  of\nthe old woman's money and to use it for my first\nyears  without  worrying  my  mother,  to  keep\nmyself at the university and for a little while after\nleaving it-and to do this all on a broad, thorough\nscale, so as to build up a completely new career\nand  enter  upon  a  new  life  of  independence....\nWell ... that's all.... Well, of course in killing the\nold woman I did wrong.... Well, that's enough.'\nHe  struggled  to  the  end  of  his  speech  in\nexhaustion and let his head sink.\n'Oh,  that's  not  it,  that's  not  it,'  Sonia  cried  in\ndistress. 'How could one ... no, that's not right,\nnot right.'\n'You  see  yourself  that  it's  not  right.  But  I've\nspoken truly, (cid:24)(cid:24) it's the truth.'\n'As though that could be the truth! Good God!'", "'I've  only  killed  a  louse,  Sonia,  a  useless,\nloathsome, harmful creature.'\n'A human being-a louse!'\n'I  too  know  it  wasn't  a  louse,'  he  answered,\nlooking  strangely  at  her.  'But  I  am  talking\nnonsense,  Sonia,'  he  added.  'I've  been  talking\nnonsense  a  long  time....  That's  not  it,  you  are\nright there. There were quite, quite other causes\nfor  it!  I  haven't  talked  to  anyone  for  so  long,\nSonia.... My head aches dreadfully now.'\nHis eyes shone with feverish brilliance. He was\nalmost delirious; an uneasy smile strayed on his\nlips.  His  terrible  exhaustion  could  be  seen\nthrough his excitement. Sonia saw how he was\nsuffering.  She  too  was  growing  dizzy.  And  he\ntalked  so  strangely;  it  seemed  somehow\ncomprehensible, but yet ... 'But how, how! Good\nGod!' And she wrung her hands in despair.\n'No,  Sonia,  that's  not  it,'  he  began  again\nsuddenly,  raising  his  head,  as  though  a  new\nand sudden train of thought had struck and as it\nwere  roused  him-'that's  not  it!  Better  ...\nimagine-yes,  it's  certainly  better-imagine  that  I", "am  vain,  envious,  malicious,  base,  vindictive\nand ... well, perhaps with a tendency to insanity.\n(Let's  have  it  all  out  at  once!  They've  talked  of\nmadness already, I noticed.) I told you just now\nI could not keep myself at the university. But do\nyou know that perhaps I might have done? My\nmother  would  have  sent  me  what  I  needed  for\nthe  fees  and  I  could  have  earned  enough  for\nclothes,  boots  and  food,  no  doubt.  (cid:24)  Lessons\nhad  turned  up  at  half  a  rouble.  Razumihin\nworks!  But  I  turned  sulky  and  wouldn't.  (Yes,\nsulkiness, that's the right word for it!) I sat in my\nroom  like  a  spider.  You've  been  in  my  den,\nyou've seen it.... And do you know, Sonia, that\nlow ceilings and tiny rooms cramp the soul and\nthe mind? Ah, how I hated that garret! And yet I\nwouldn't  go  out  of  it!  I  wouldn't  on  purpose!  I\ndidn't  go  out  for  days  together,  and  I  wouldn't\nwork, I wouldn't even eat, I just lay there doing\nnothing. If Nastasya brought me anything, I ate\nit, if she didn't, I went all day without; I wouldn't\nask, on purpose, from sulkiness! At night I had\nno  light,  I  lay  in  the  dark  and  I  wouldn't  earn\nmoney for candles. I ought to have studied, but\nI sold my books; and the dust lies an inch thick\non the notebooks on my table. I preferred lying\nstill  and  thinking.  And  I  kept  thinking....  And  I", "had  dreams  all  the  time,  strange  dreams  of  all\nsorts, no need to describe! Only then I began to\nfancy that ... No, that's not it! Again I am telling\nyou wrong! You see I kept asking myself then:\nwhy am I so stupid that if others are stupid-and I\nknow they are-yet I won't be wiser? Then I saw,\nSonia, that if one waits for everyone to get wiser\nit  will  take  too  long....  Afterwards  I  understood\nthat  that  would  never  come  to  pass,  that  men\nwon't  change  and  that  nobody  can  alter  it  and\nthat  it's  not  worth  wasting  effort  over  it.  Yes,\nthat's  so.  That's  the  law  of  their  nature,  Sonia,\n...  that's  so!  ...  And  I  know  now,  Sonia,  that\nwhoever  is  strong  in  mind  and  spirit  will  have\npower over them. Anyone who is greatly daring\nis  right  in  their  eyes.  He  who  despises  most\nthings  will  be  a  lawgiver  among  them  and  he\nwho dares most of all will be most in the right! (cid:24)(cid:24)\nSo it has been till now and so it will always be.\nA man must be blind not to see it!'\nThough Raskolnikov looked at Sonia as he said\nthis,  he  no  longer  cared  whether  she\nunderstood or not. The fever had complete hold\nof him; he was in a sort of gloomy ecstasy (he\ncertainly  had  been  too  long  without  talking  to\nanyone).  Sonia  felt  that  his  gloomy  creed  had", "become his faith and code.\n'I divined then, Sonia,' he went on eagerly, 'that\npower is only vouchsafed to the man who dares\nto stoop and pick it up. There is only one thing,\none  thing  needful:  one  has  only  to  dare!  Then\nfor the first time in my life an idea took shape in\nmy  mind  which  no  one  had  ever  thought  of\nbefore me, no one! I saw clear as daylight how\nstrange it is that not a single person living in this\nmad world has had the daring to go straight for\nit all and send it flying to the devil! I ... I wanted\nto  have  the  daring  ...  and  I  killed  her.  I  only\nwanted to have the daring, Sonia! That was the\nwhole cause of it!'\n'Oh  hush,  hush,'  cried  Sonia,  clasping  her\nhands.  'You  turned  away  from  God  and  God\nhas  smitten  you,  has  given  you  over  to  the\ndevil!'\n'Then Sonia, when I used to lie there in the dark\nand  all  this  became  clear  to  me,  was  it  a\ntemptation of the devil, eh?'\n'Hush,  don't  laugh,  blasphemer!  You  don't\nunderstand, you don't understand! Oh God! He", "won't understand!'\n'Hush, Sonia! I am not laughing. I know myself\nthat  it  was  the  devil  leading  me.  Hush,  Sonia,\nhush!'  he  repeated  with  gloomy  insistence.  'I\nknow it all, I have thought it (cid:24) all over and over\nand whispered it all over to myself, lying there in\nthe  dark....  I've  argued  it  all  over  with  myself,\nevery point of it, and I know it all, all! And how\nsick,  how  sick  I  was  then  of  going  over  it  all!  I\nhave kept wanting to forget it and make a new\nbeginning,  Sonia,  and  leave  off  thinking.  And\nyou  don't  suppose  that  I  went  into  it  headlong\nlike  a  fool?  I  went  into  it  like  a  wise  man,  and\nthat  was  just  my  destruction.  And  you  mustn't\nsuppose that I didn't know, for instance, that if I\nbegan  to  question  myself  whether  I  had  the\nright to gain power-I certainly hadn't the right-or\nthat if I asked myself whether a human being is\na louse it proved that it wasn't so for me, though\nit might be for a man who would go straight to\nhis goal without asking questions.... If I worried\nmyself  all  those  days,  wondering  whether\nNapoleon  would  have  done  it  or  not,  I  felt\nclearly of course that I wasn't Napoleon. I had to\nendure  all  the  agony  of  that  battle  of  ideas,\nSonia,  and  I  longed  to  throw  it  off:  I  wanted  to", "murder without casuistry, to murder for my own\nsake, for myself alone! I didn't want to lie about\nit even to myself. It wasn't to help my mother I\ndid  the  murder-that's  nonsense  -I  didn't  do  the\nmurder  to  gain  wealth  and  power  and  to\nbecome  a  benefactor  of  mankind.  Nonsense!  I\nsimply  did  it;  I  did  the  murder  for  myself,  for\nmyself  alone,  and  whether  I  became  a\nbenefactor  to  others,  or  spent  my  life  like  a\nspider catching men in my web and sucking the\nlife  out  of  men,  I  couldn't  have  cared  at  that\nmoment.... And it was not the money I wanted,\nSonia,  when  I  did  it.  It  was  not  so  much  the\nmoney I wanted, but something else.... I know it\nall  now....  Understand  me!  Perhaps  I  should\nnever  have  (cid:24)(cid:24)  committed  a  murder  again.  I\nwanted  to  find  out  something  else;  it  was\nsomething else led me on. I wanted to find out\nthen  and  quickly  whether  I  was  a  louse  like\neverybody  else  or  a  man.  Whether  I  can  step\nover barriers or not, whether I dare stoop to pick\nup or not, whether I am a trembling creature or\nwhether I have the right ...'\n'To  kill?  Have  the  right  to  kill?'  Sonia  clasped\nher hands.", "'Ach,  Sonia!'  he  cried  irritably  and  seemed\nabout  to  make  some  retort,  but  was\ncontemptuously  silent.  'Don't  interrupt  me,\nSonia.  I  want  to  prove  one  thing  only,  that  the\ndevil  led  me  on  then  and  he  has  shown  me\nsince  that  I  had  not  the  right  to  take  that  path,\nbecause I am just such a louse as all the rest.\nHe was mocking me and here I've come to you\nnow!

Enough, enough, Sonia, enough!\nLet  me  be!'  he  cried  in  a  sudden  spasm  of\nagony, 'let me be!'\nHe  leaned  his  elbows  on  his  knees  and\nsqueezed his head in his hands as in a vise.", "'What  suffering!'  A  wail  of  anguish  broke  from\nSonia.\n'Well, what am I to do now?' he asked, suddenly\nraising his head and looking at her with a face\nhideously distorted (cid:24) by despair.\n'What  are  you  to  do?'  she  cried,  jumping  up,\nand  her  eyes  that  had  been  full  of  tears\nsuddenly  began  to  shine.  'Stand  up!'  (She\nseized  him  by  the  shoulder,  he  got  up,  looking\nat her almost bewildered.) 'Go at once, this very\nminute,  stand  at  the  cross-roads,  bow  down,\nfirst  kiss  the  earth  which  you  have  defiled  and\nthen  bow  down  to  all  the  world  and  say  to  all\nmen  aloud,  'I  am  a  murderer!'  Then  God  will\nsend  you  life  again.  Will  you  go,  will  you  go?'\nshe asked him, trembling all over, snatching his\ntwo  hands,  squeezing  them  tight  in  hers  and\ngazing at him with eyes full of fire.\nHe was amazed at her sudden ecstasy.\n'You  mean  Siberia,  Sonia?  I  must  give  myself\nup?' he asked gloomily.", "'Suffer  and  expiate  your  sin  by  it,  that's  what\nyou must do.'\n'No! I am not going to them, Sonia!'\n'But how will you go on living? What will you live\nfor?' cried Sonia, 'how is it possible now? Why,\nhow can you talk to your mother? (Oh, what will\nbecome  of  them  now?)  But  what  am  I  saying?\nYou  have  abandoned  your  mother  and  your\nsister already. He has abandoned them already!\nOh,  God!'  she  cried,  'why,  he  knows  it  all\nhimself. How, how can he live by himself! What\nwill become of you now?'\n'Don't  be  a  child,  Sonia,'  he  said  softly.  'What\nwrong  have  I  done  them?  Why  should  I  go  to\nthem? What should I say to them? That's only a\nphantom....  They  destroy  men  by  millions\nthemselves and look on it as a virtue. They are\nknaves  and  scoundrels,  Sonia!  I  am  not  going\nto them. And (cid:24)(cid:24) what should I say to them-that I\nmurdered  her,  but  did  not  dare  to  take  the\nmoney and hid it under a stone?' he added with\na  bitter  smile.  'Why,  they  would  laugh  at  me,\nand  would  call  me  a  fool  for  not  getting  it.  A\ncoward  and  a  fool!  They  wouldn't  understand", "and  they  don't  deserve  to  understand.

Don't  be  a  child,\nSonia....'\n'It  will  be  too  much  for  you  to  bear,  too  much!'\nshe  repeated,  holding  out  her  hands  in\ndespairing supplication.\n'Perhaps  I've  been  unfair  to  myself,'  he\nobserved gloomily, pondering, 'perhaps after all\nI am a man and not a louse and I've been in too\ngreat  a  hurry  to  condemn  myself.  I'll  make\nanother fight for it.'\nA haughty smile appeared on his lips.\n'What  a  burden  to  bear!  And  your  whole  life,\nyour whole life!'\n'I  shall  get  used  to  it,'  he  said  grimly  and\nthoughtfully.  'Listen,'  he  began  a  minute  later,\n'stop  crying,  it's  time  to  talk  of  the  facts:  I've\ncome to tell you that the police are after me, on\nmy track....'\n'Ach!' Sonia cried in terror.", "'Well, why do you cry out? You want me to go to\nSiberia and now you are frightened? But let me\ntell you: I shall not give myself up. I shall make\na  struggle  for  it  and  they  won't  do  anything  to\nme. They've no real evidence. Yesterday I was\nin  great  danger  and  believed  I  was  lost;  but\nto-day things are going better. All the facts they\nknow can be explained two ways, that's to say I\ncan turn their accusations to my credit, do you\nunderstand? And I shall, for I've learnt (cid:24)(cid:24)0 Crime\nand  Punishment  my  lesson.  But  they  will\ncertainly  arrest  me.  If  it  had  not  been  for\nsomething  that  happened,  they  would  have\ndone  so  to-day  for  certain;  perhaps  even  now\nthey will arrest me today....

He\nlooked at Sonia and felt how great was her love\nfor  him,  and  strange  to  say  he  felt  it  suddenly\nburdensome and painful to be so loved. Yes, it\nwas a strange and awful sensation! On his way\nto  see  Sonia  he  had  felt  that  all  his  hopes\nrested on her; he expected to be rid of at least\npart  of  his  suffering,  and  now,  when  all  her\nheart turned towards him, he suddenly felt that\nhe was immeasurably unhappier than before.\n'Sonia,' he said, 'you'd better not come and see\nme when I am in prison.'\nSonia  did  not  answer,  she  was  crying.  Several\nminutes passed.\n'Have  you  a  cross  on  you?'  she  asked,  as\nthough  suddenly  thinking  of  it.(cid:24)1  He  did  not  at\nfirst understand the question.\n'No,  of  course  not.  Here,  take  this  one,  of\ncypress  wood.  I  have  another,  a  copper  one", "that  belonged  to  Lizaveta.  I  changed  with\nLizaveta: she gave me her cross and I gave her\nmy little ikon. I will wear Lizaveta's now and give\nyou  this.  Take  it  ...  it's  mine!  It's  mine,  you\nknow,'  she  begged  him.  'We  will  go  to  suffer\ntogether, and together we will bear our cross!'\n'Give it me,' said Raskolnikov.\nHe  did  not  want  to  hurt  her  feelings.  But\nimmediately he drew back the hand he held out\nfor the cross.\n'Not  now,  Sonia.  Better  later,'  he  added  to\ncomfort her.\n'Yes, yes, better,' she repeated with conviction,\n'when you go to meet your suffering, then put it\non. You will come to me, I'll put it on you, we will\npray and go together.'\nAt  that  moment  someone  knocked  three  times\nat the door.\n'Sofya  Semyonovna,  may  I  come  in?'  they\nheard in a very familiar and polite voice.", "Sonia rushed to the door in a fright.

Katerina  Ivanovna  has\ngone out of her mind,' he blurted out suddenly,\nturning from Raskolnikov to Sonia.\nSonia screamed.\n'At least it seems so. But ... we don't know what\nto  do,  you  see!

Raskolnikov\nfollowed her and Lebeziatnikov came after him.\n'She  has  certainly  gone  mad!'  he  said  to\nRaskolnikov, as they went out into the street.

So it seems at least.'\nRaskolnikov  had  long  ceased  to  listen.\nReaching the house where he lived, he nodded\nto  Lebeziatnikov  and  went  in  at  the  gate.\nLebeziatnikov  woke  up  with  a  start,  looked\nabout him and hurried on.\nRaskolnikov went into his little room and stood\nstill in the middle of it.

At first she stood still and looked at him from\nthe doorway, just as he had done at Sonia; then\nshe came in and sat down in the same place as\nyesterday,  on  the  chair  facing  him.  He  looked\nsilently and almost vacantly at her.\n'Don't be angry, brother; I've only come for one\nminute,' said Dounia.\nHer  face  looked  thoughtful  but  not  stern.

Good-bye.'\nHe  turned  away,  and  walked  to  the  window.\nShe  stood  a  moment,  looked  at  him  uneasily,\nand went out troubled.\nNo,  he  was  not  cold  to  her.

'No, she wouldn't;\ngirls like that can't stand things! They never do.'", "And he thought of Sonia.\nThere  was  a  breath  of  fresh  air  from  the\nwindow.  The  daylight  was  fading.  He  took  up\nhis cap and went out.\nHe could not, of course, and would not consider\nhow ill he was. But all this continual anxiety and\nagony  of  mind  could  not  but  affect  him.  And  if\nhe  were  not  lying  in  high  fever  it  was  perhaps\njust  because  this  continual  inner  strain  helped\nto keep him on his legs and in possession of his\nfaculties. But this artificial excitement could not\nlast long.\nHe wandered aimlessly. The sun was setting. A\nspecial  form  of  misery  had  begun  to  oppress\nhim  of  late.  There  was  nothing  poignant,\nnothing acute about it; but there was a feeling of\npermanence,  of  eternity  about  it;  it  brought  a\nforetaste  of  hopeless  years  of  this  cold  leaden\nmisery,  a  foretaste  of  an  eternity  'on  a  square\nyard of space.' Towards evening this sensation\nusually began to weigh on him more heavily.\n'With  this  idiotic,  purely  physical  weakness,", "depending  on  the  sunset  or  something,  one\ncan't  help  doing  something  stupid!  You'll  go  to\nDounia,  as  well  as  to  Sonia,'  he  muttered\nbitterly.\nHe  heard  his  name  called.  He  looked  round.\nLebeziatnikov rushed up to him.\n'Only  fancy,  I've  been  to  your  room  looking  for\nyou.  Only  (cid:24)  fancy,  she's  carried  out  her  plan,\nand  taken  away  the  children.  Sofya\nSemyonovna and I have had a job to find them.\nShe is rapping on a frying-pan and making the\nchildren  dance.  The  children  are  crying.  They\nkeep stopping at the cross-roads and in front of\nshops;  there's  a  crowd  of  fools  running  after\nthem. Come along!'\n'And  Sonia?'  Raskolnikov  asked  anxiously,\nhurrying after Lebeziatnikov.\n'Simply  frantic.  That  is,  it's  not  Sofya\nSemyonovna's  frantic,  but  Katerina  Ivanovna,\nthough  Sofya  Semyonova's  frantic  too.  But\nKaterina Ivanovna is absolutely frantic. I tell you\nshe is quite mad. They'll be taken to the police.\nYou  can  fancy  what  an  effect  that  will  have....", "They  are  on  the  canal  bank,  near  the  bridge\nnow,  not  far  from  Sofya  Semyonovna's,  quite\nclose.'\nOn the canal bank near the bridge and not two\nhouses away from the one where Sonia lodged,\nthere  was  a  crowd  of  people,  consisting\nprincipally of gutter children. The hoarse broken\nvoice of Katerina Ivanovna could be heard from\nthe  bridge,  and  it  certainly  was  a  strange\nspectacle  likely  to  attract  a  street  crowd.\nKaterina  Ivanovna  in  her  old  dress  with  the\ngreen shawl, wearing a torn straw hat, crushed\nin a hideous way on one side, was really frantic.\nShe was exhausted and breathless. Her wasted\nconsumptive  face  looked  more  suffering  than\never, and indeed out of doors in the sunshine a\nconsumptive always looks worse than at home.\nBut  her  excitement  did  not  flag,  and  every\nmoment  her  irritation  grew  more  intense.  She\nrushed at the children, shouted at them, coaxed\nthem, told them before the crowd how to dance\nand  (cid:24)(cid:24)  what  to  sing,  began  explaining  to  them\nwhy it was necessary, and driven to desperation\nby  their  not  understanding,  beat  them....  Then\nshe  would  make  a  rush  at  the  crowd;  if  she\nnoticed  any  decently  dressed  person  stopping", "to look, she immediately appealed to him to see\nwhat  these  children  'from  a  genteel,  one  may\nsay aristocratic, house' had been brought to. If\nshe heard laughter or jeering in the crowd, she\nwould  rush  at  once  at  the  scoffers  and  begin\nsquabbling  with  them.  Some  people  laughed,\nothers  shook  their  heads,  but  everyone  felt\ncurious  at  the  sight  of  the  madwoman  with  the\nfrightened  children.  The  frying-pan  of  which\nLebeziatnikov  had  spoken  was  not  there,  at\nleast Raskolnikov did not see it. But instead of\nrapping  on  the  pan,  Katerina  Ivanovna  began\nclapping  her  wasted  hands,  when  she  made\nLida  and  Kolya  dance  and  Polenka  sing.  She\ntoo joined in the singing, but broke down at the\nsecond  note  with  a  fearful  cough,  which  made\nher curse in despair and even shed tears. What\nmade  her  most  furious  was  the  weeping  and\nterror of Kolya and Lida. Some effort had been\nmade to dress the children up as street singers\nare dressed. The boy had on a turban made of\nsomething  red  and  white  to  look  like  a  Turk.\nThere  had  been  no  costume  for  Lida;  she\nsimply  had  a  red  knitted  cap,  or  rather  a  night\ncap  that  had  belonged  to  Marmeladov,\ndecorated  with  a  broken  piece  of  white  ostrich\nfeather,  which  had  been  Katerina  Ivanovna's", "grandmother's  and  had  been  preserved  as  a\nfamily possession. Polenka was in her everyday\ndress;  she  looked  in  timid  perplexity  at  her\nmother,  and  kept  at  her  side,  hiding  her  tears.\nShe  dimly  realised  her  mother's  condition,  and\nlooked  uneasily  about  (cid:24)00  Crime  and\nPunishment  her.  She  was  terribly  frightened  of\nthe  street  and  the  crowd.  Sonia  followed\nKaterina  Ivanovna,  weeping  and  beseeching\nher to return home, but Katerina Ivanovna was\nnot to be persuaded.\n'Leave  off,  Sonia,  leave  off,'  she  shouted,\nspeaking fast, panting and coughing. 'You don't\nknow what you ask; you are like a child! I've told\nyou  before  that  I  am  not  coming  back  to  that\ndrunken  German.  Let  everyone,  let  all\nPetersburg  see  the  children  begging  in  the\nstreets,  though  their  father  was  an  honourable\nman who served all his life in truth and fidelity,\nand one may say died in the service.' (Katerina\nIvanovna  had  by  now  invented  this  fantastic\nstory  and  thoroughly  believed  it.)  'Let  that\nwretch  of  a  general  see  it!  And  you  are  silly,\nSonia:  what  have  we  to  eat?  Tell  me  that.  We\nhave worried you enough, I won't go on so!

Even organ-grinders earn\ntheir  living,  and  everyone  will  see  at  once  that\nwe are different, that we are an honourable and\nbereaved  family  reduced  to  beggary.  And  that\ngeneral  will  lose  his  post,  you'll  see!  We  shall\nperform under his windows every day, and if the\nTsar  drives  by,  I'll  fall  on  my  knees,  put  the\nchildren before me, show them to him, and say\n'Defend  us  father.'  He  is  the  father  of  the\nfatherless, he is merciful, he'll protect us, you'll\nsee, and that wretch of a general.... Lida, tenez\nvous droite! Kolya, you'll dance again. Why are\nyou  whimpering?  Whimpering  again!  What  are\nyou  afraid  of,  stupid?  Goodness,  what  am  I  to\ndo  with  them,  Rodion  Romanovitch?

What's  one  to\ndo with such children?'\nAnd  she,  almost  crying  herself-which  did  not\nstop her uninterrupted, rapid flow of talk-pointed\nto  the  crying  children.  Raskolnikov  tried  to\npersuade  her  to  go  home,  and  even  said,\nhoping  to  work  on  her  vanity,  that  it  was\nunseemly  for  her  to  be  wandering  about  the\nstreets  like  an  organ-grinder,  as  she  was", "intending  to  become  the  principal  of  a\nboarding-school.\n'A  boarding-school,  ha-ha-ha!

But  enough  of\nthem,  now  I'll  provide  for  the  children  myself,  I\nwon't  bow  down  to  anybody!

'It's all because Kolya here is so\nstupid; I have such a bother with him. What do\nyou  want,  Polenka?  Tell  me  in  French,\nparlez-moi  français.

We  aren't  going  to  have  a\nPunch  (cid:24)0(cid:24)  Crime  and  Punishment  and  Judy\nshow in the street, but to sing a genteel song....\nAh,  yes,  ...  What  are  we  to  sing?  You  keep\nputting  me  out,  but  we  ...  you  see,  we  are\nstanding  here,  Rodion  Romanovitch,  to  find\nsomething  to  sing  and  get  money,  something\nKolya  can  dance  to....  For,  as  you  can  fancy,\nour  performance  is  all  impromptu....  We  must\ntalk  it  over  and  rehearse  it  all  thoroughly,  and\nthen we shall go to Nevsky, where there are far\nmore  people  of  good  society,  and  we  shall  be\nnoticed  at  once.  Lida  knows  'My  Village'  only,\nnothing  but  'My  Village,'  and  everyone  sings\nthat.  We  must  sing  something  far  more\ngenteel....  Well,  have  you  thought  of  anything,\nPolenka?  If  only  you'd  help  your  mother!  My\nmemory's quite gone, or I should have thought\nof something. We really can't sing 'An Hussar.'\nAh,  let  us  sing  in  French,  'Cinq  sous,'  I  have\ntaught it you, I have taught it you. And as it is in\nFrench,  people  will  see  at  once  that  you  are\nchildren  of  good  family,  and  that  will  be  much\nmore  touching....  You  might  sing  'Marlborough\ns'en  va-t-en  guerre,'  for  that's  quite  a  child's\nsong  and  is  sung  as  a  lullaby  in  all  the", "aristocratic houses.\n'Marlborough s'en va-t-en guerre Ne sait quand\nreviendra ...'\nshe  began  singing.  'But  no,  better  sing  'Cinq\nsous.'  Now,  Kolya,  your  hands  on  your  hips,\nmake  haste,  and  you,  Lida,  keep  turning  the\nother way, and Polenka and I will sing and clap\nour hands!\n'Cinq  sous,  cinq  sous  Pour  monter  notre\nmenage.'\n(Cough-cough-cough!)

What do you want?'\nA  policeman  was  indeed  forcing  his  way\nthrough  the  crowd.  But  at  that  moment  a\ngentleman in civilian uniform and an overcoat-a\nsolid-  looking  official  of  about  fifty  with  a\ndecoration  on  his  neck  (which  delighted\nKaterina  Ivanovna  and  had  its  effect  on  the\npoliceman)-  approached  and  without  a  word\nhanded her a green three-rouble note. His face\nwore  a  look  of  genuine  sympathy.  Katerina\nIvanovna  took  it  and  gave  him  a  polite,  even\nceremonious, bow.\n'I  thank  you,  honoured  sir,'  she  began  loftily.\n'The  causes  that  have  induced  us  (take  the\nmoney,  Polenka:  you  see  there  are  generous\nand honourable people who are ready to help a\npoor  gentlewoman  in  distress).

'Your\nexcellency,' I said, 'protect the orphans, for you", "knew  my  late  husband,  Semyon  Zaharovitch,\nand on the very day of his death the basest of\nscoundrels slandered his only daughter.' ... That\npoliceman  again!  Protect  me,'  she  cried  to  the\nofficial.  'Why  is  that  policeman  edging  up  to\nme?  We  have  only  just  run  (cid:24)0(cid:24)  Crime  and\nPunishment  away  from  one  of  them.  What  do\nyou want, fool?'\n'It's forbidden in the streets. You mustn't make a\ndisturbance.'\n'It's  you're  making  a  disturbance.  It's  just  the\nsame  as  if  I  were  grinding  an  organ.  What\nbusiness is it of yours?'\n'You have to get a licence for an organ, and you\nhaven't  got  one,  and  in  that  way  you  collect  a\ncrowd. Where do you lodge?'\n'What,  a  license?'  wailed  Katerina  Ivanovna.  'I\nburied  my  husband  to-day.  What  need  of  a\nlicense?'\n'Calm  yourself,  madam,  calm  yourself,'  began\nthe official. 'Come along; I will escort you.... This\nis no place for you in the crowd. You are ill.'", "'Honoured  sir,  honoured  sir,  you  don't  know,'\nscreamed  Katerina  Ivanovna.  'We  are  going  to\nthe Nevsky.... Sonia, Sonia! Where is she? She\nis  crying  too!  What's  the  matter  with  you  all?\nKolya,  Lida,  where  are  you  going?'  she  cried\nsuddenly  in  alarm.  'Oh,  silly  children!  Kolya,\nLida, where are they off to? ...'\nKolya  and  Lida,  scared  out  of  their  wits  by  the\ncrowd, and their mother's mad pranks, suddenly\nseized  each  other  by  the  hand,  and  ran  off  at\nthe  sight  of  the  policeman  who  wanted  to  take\nthem  away  somewhere.  Weeping  and  wailing,\npoor Katerina Ivanovna ran after them. She was\na piteous and unseemly spectacle, as she ran,\nweeping  and  panting  for  breath.  Sonia  and\nPolenka rushed after them.\n'Bring  them  back,  bring  them  back,  Sonia!  Oh\nstupid,  ungrateful  children!  ...  Polenka!  catch\nthem.... It's for your sakes I ...'0(cid:24) She stumbled\nas she ran and fell down.\n'She's  cut  herself,  she's  bleeding!  Oh,  dear!'\ncried Sonia, bending over her.", "All  ran  up  and  crowded  around.  Raskolnikov\nand Lebeziatnikov were the first at her side, the\nofficial  too  hastened  up,  and  behind  him  the\npoliceman  who  muttered,  'Bother!'  with  a\ngesture  of  impatience,  feeling  that  the  job  was\ngoing to be a troublesome one.\n'Pass  on!  Pass  on!'  he  said  to  the  crowd  that\npressed forward.\n'She's dying,' someone shouted.\n'She's gone out of her mind,' said another.\n'Lord  have  mercy  upon  us,'  said  a  woman,\ncrossing herself. 'Have they caught the little girl\nand  the  boy?  They're  being  brought  back,  the\nelder one's got them.... Ah, the naughty imps!'\nWhen  they  examined  Katerina  Ivanovna\ncarefully, they saw that she had not cut herself\nagainst a stone, as Sonia thought, but that the\nblood  that  stained  the  pavement  red  was  from\nher chest.\n'I've  seen  that  before,'  muttered  the  official  to\nRaskolnikov  and  Lebeziatnikov;  'that's", "consumption;  the  blood  flows  and  chokes  the\npatient.  I  saw  the  same  thing  with  a  relative  of\nmy own not long ago ... nearly a pint of blood,\nall  in  a  minute....  What's  to  be  done  though?\nShe is dying.'\n'This  way,  this  way,  to  my  room!'  Sonia\nimplored.  'I  live  here!  ...  See,  that  house,  the\nsecond from here.... Come to me, make haste,'\nshe turned from one to the other. 'Send for the\ndoctor!  Oh,  dear!'(cid:24)0(cid:24)  Crime  and  Punishment\nThanks  to  the  official's  efforts,  this  plan  was\nadopted,  the  policeman  even  helping  to  carry\nKaterina  Ivanovna.  She  was  carried  to  Sonia's\nroom, almost unconscious, and laid on the bed.\nThe blood was still flowing, but she seemed to\nbe  coming  to  herself.  Raskolnikov,\nLebeziatnikov,  and  the  official  accompanied\nSonia  into  the  room  and  were  followed  by  the\npoliceman,  who  first  drove  back  the  crowd\nwhich followed to the very door. Polenka came\nin  holding  Kolya  and  Lida,  who  were  trembling\nand weeping. Several persons came in too from\nthe  Kapernaumovs'  room;  the  landlord,  a  lame\none-eyed  man  of  strange  appearance  with\nwhiskers and hair that stood up like a brush, his\nwife,  a  woman  with  an  everlastingly  scared", "expression,  and  several  openmouthed  children\nwith  wonder-struck  faces.  Among  these,\nSvidrigaïlov  suddenly  made  his  appearance.\nRaskolnikov  looked  at  him  with  surprise,  not\nunderstanding where he had come from and not\nhaving  noticed  him  in  the  crowd.  A  doctor  and\npriest wore spoken of. The official whispered to\nRaskolnikov that he thought it was too late now\nfor the doctor, but he ordered him to be sent for.\nKapernaumov ran himself.\nMeanwhile Katerina Ivanovna had regained her\nbreath.  The  bleeding  ceased  for  a  time.  She\nlooked with sick but intent and penetrating eyes\nat Sonia, who stood pale and trembling, wiping\nthe sweat from her brow with a handkerchief. At\nlast she asked to be raised. They sat her up on\nthe bed, supporting her on both sides.\n'Where  are  the  children?'  she  said  in  a  faint\nvoice.  'You've  brought  them,  Polenka?  Oh  the\nsillies! Why did you run 0(cid:24) away.... Och!'\nOnce more her parched lips were covered with\nblood. She moved her eyes, looking about her.\n'So that's how you live, Sonia! Never once have", "I been in your room.'\nShe looked at her with a face of suffering.\n'We have been your ruin, Sonia. Polenka, Lida,\nKolya,  come  here!  Well,  here  they  are,  Sonia,\ntake them all! I hand them over to you, I've had\nenough!  The  ball  is  over.'  (Cough!)  'Lay  me\ndown, let me die in peace.'\nThey laid her back on the pillow.\n'What, the priest? I don't want him. You haven't\ngot a rouble to spare. I have no sins. God must\nforgive  me  without  that.  He  knows  how  I  have\nsuffered....  And  if  He  won't  forgive  me,  I  don't\ncare!'\nShe sank more and more into uneasy delirium.\nAt  times  she  shuddered,  turned  her  eyes  from\nside to side, recognised everyone for a minute,\nbut  at  once  sank  into  delirium  again.  Her\nbreathing was hoarse and difficult, there was a\nsort of rattle in her throat.\n'I said to him, your excellency,' she ejaculated,\ngasping  after  each  word.  'That  Amalia", "Ludwigovna,  ah!

At\nlast,  in  a  horribly  hoarse,  broken  voice,  she", "began,  shrieking  and  gasping  at  every  word,\nwith a look of growing terror.\n'In  the  heat  of  midday!  ...  in  the  vale!  ...  of\nDagestan! ...

'Sonia darling, are you here, too?'\nThey lifted her up again.\n'Enough!  It's  over!  Farewell,  poor  thing!  I  am\ndone for! I am broken!' she cried with vindictive\ndespair,  and  her  head  fell  heavily  back  on  the\npillow.\nShe  sank  into  unconsciousness  again,  but  this\ntime  it  did  not  last  long.  Her  pale,  yellow,", "wasted face dropped back, her mouth fell open,\nher  leg  moved  convulsively,  she  gave  a  deep,\ndeep sigh and died.\nSonia  fell  upon  her,  flung  her  arms  about  her,\nand remained motionless with her head pressed\nto the dead 0(cid:24) woman's wasted bosom. Polenka\nthrew herself at her mother's feet, kissing them\nand  weeping  violently.  Though  Kolya  and  Lida\ndid  not  understand  what  had  happened,  they\nhad a feeling that it was something terrible; they\nput their hands on each other's little shoulders,\nstared straight at one another and both at once\nopened  their  mouths  and  began  screaming.\nThey were both still in their fancy dress; one in\na  turban,  the  other  in  the  cap  with  the  ostrich\nfeather.\nAnd how did 'the certificate of merit' come to be\non  the  bed  beside  Katerina  Ivanovna?  It  lay\nthere by the pillow; Raskolnikov saw it.\nHe  walked  away  to  the  window.  Lebeziatnikov\nskipped up to him.\n'She is dead,' he said.", "'Rodion  Romanovitch,  I  must  have  two  words\nwith you,' said Svidrigaïlov, coming up to them.\nLebeziatnikov  at  once  made  room  for  him  and\ndelicately  withdrew.  Svidrigaïlov  drew\nRaskolnikov further away.\n'I  will  undertake  all  the  arrangements,  the\nfuneral  and  that.  You  know  it's  a  question  of\nmoney and, as I told you, I have plenty to spare.\nI will put those two little ones and Polenka into\nsome  good  orphan  asylum,  and  I  will  settle\nfifteen  hundred  roubles  to  be  paid  to  each  on\ncoming of age, so that Sofya Semyonovna need\nhave no anxiety about them. And I will pull her\nout  of  the  mud  too,  for  she  is  a  good  girl,  isn't\nshe?  So  tell  Avdotya  Romanovna  that  that  is\nhow I am spending her ten thousand.'\n'What  is  your  motive  for  such  benevolence?'\nasked  Raskolnikov.(cid:24)10  Crime  and  Punishment\n'Ah! you sceptical person!' laughed Svidrigaïlov.\n'I  told  you  I  had  no  need  of  that  money.  Won't\nyou admit that it's simply done from humanity?\nShe  wasn't  'a  louse,'  you  know'  (he  pointed  to\nthe  corner  where  the  dead  woman  lay),  'was\nshe, like some old pawnbroker woman? Come,", "you'll agree, is Luzhin to go on living, and doing\nwicked  things  or  is  she  to  die?  And  if  I  didn't\nhelp them, Polenka would go the same way.'\nHe said this with an air of a sort of gay winking\nslyness, keeping his eyes fixed on Raskolnikov,\nwho  turned  white  and  cold,  hearing  his  own\nphrases,  spoken  to  Sonia.  He  quickly  stepped\nback and looked wildly at Svidrigaïlov.'How  do \nyou    know?'    he    whispered,    hardly    able    to\nbreathe.\n'Why,  I  lodge  here  at  Madame  Resslich's,  the\nother  side  of  the  wall.  Here  is  Kapernaumov,\nand  there  lives  Madame  Resslich,  an  old  and\ndevoted friend of mine. I am a neighbour.''You?'\n'Yes,'  continued  Svidrigaïlov,  shaking  with\nlaughter.  'I  assure  you  on  my  honour,  dear\nRodion  Romanovitch,  that  you  have  interested\nme  enormously.  I  told  you  we  should  become\nfriends,  I  foretold  it.  Well,  here  we  have.  And\nyou  will  see  what  an  accommodating  person  I\nam. You'll see that you can get on with me!'11 ", "#$#$Chapter 36#$#$\n(cid:24)1(cid:24) Crime and Punishment ", "#$#$Chapter 37#$#$\nA strange period began for Raskolnikov: it was\nas though \na fog had fallen upon him and wrapped him in a\ndreary  solitude  from  which  there  was  no\nescape.  Recalling  that  period  long  after,  he\nbelieved  that  his  mind  had  been  clouded  at\ntimes,  and  that  it  had  continued  so,  with\nintervals,  till  the  final  catastrophe.  He  was\nconvinced  that  he  had  been  mistaken  about\nmany things at that time, for instance as to the\ndate  of  certain  events.  Anyway,  when  he  tried\nlater  on  to  piece  his  recollections  together,  he\nlearnt  a  great  deal  about  himself  from  what\nother  people  told  him.  He  had  mixed  up\nincidents  and  had  explained  events  as  due  to\ncircumstances  which  existed  only  in  his\nimagination. At times he was a prey to agonies\nof morbid uneasiness, amounting sometimes to\npanic.  But  he  remembered,  too,  moments,\nhours, perhaps whole days, of complete apathy,\nwhich  came  upon  him  as  a  reaction  from  his\nprevious terror and might be compared with the", "abnormal  insensibility,  sometimes  seen  in  the\ndying.  He  seemed  to  be  trying  in  that  latter\nstage  to  escape  from  a  full  and  clear\nunderstanding of his position. Certain essential\nfacts  which  required  immediate  consideration\nwere  particularly  irksome  to  him.  How  glad  he\nwould  have  been  to  be  free  from  some  cares,\nthe neglect of which would have threatened him\nwith complete, inevitable ruin.\nHe  was  particularly  worried  about  Svidrigaïlov,\nhe might 1(cid:24) be said to be permanently thinking\nof  Svidrigaïlov.  From  the  time  of  Svidrigaïlov's\ntoo  menacing  and  unmistakable  words  in\nSonia's  room  at  the  moment  of  Katerina\nIvanovna's  death,  the  normal  working  of  his\nmind seemed to break down. But although this\nnew  fact  caused  him  extreme  uneasiness,\nRaskolnikov was in no hurry for an explanation\nof  it.  At  times,  finding  himself  in  a  solitary  and\nremote  part  of  the  town,  in  some  wretched\neating-house,  sitting  alone  lost  in  thought,\nhardly  knowing  how  he  had  come  there,  he\nsuddenly thought of Svidrigaïlov. He recognised\nsuddenly, clearly, and with dismay that he ought\nat  once  to  come  to  an  understanding  with  that\nman and to make what terms he could. Walking", "outside  the  city  gates  one  day,  he  positively\nfancied that they had fixed a meeting there, that\nhe was waiting for Svidrigaïlov. Another time he\nwoke  up  before  daybreak  lying  on  the  ground\nunder  some  bushes  and  could  not  at  first\nunderstand how he had come there.\nBut during the two or three days after Katerina\nIvanovna's death, he had two or three times met\nSvidrigaïlov  at  Sonia's  lodging,  where  he  had\ngone aimlessly for a moment. They exchanged\na few words and made no reference to the vital\nsubject, as though they were tacitly agreed not\nto speak of it for a time.\nKaterina  Ivanovna's  body  was  still  lying  in  the\ncoffin,  Svidrigaïlov  was  busy  making\narrangements  for  the  funeral.  Sonia  too  was\nvery  busy.  At  their  last  meeting  Svidrigaïlov\ninformed  Raskolnikov  that  he  had  made  an\narrangement,  and  a  very  satisfactory  one,  for\nKaterina  Ivanovna's  children;  that  he  had,\nthrough  certain  connections,  succeeded  (cid:24)1(cid:24)\nCrime and Punishment in getting hold of certain\npersonages  by  whose  help  the  three  orphans\ncould  be  at  once  placed  in  very  suitable\ninstitutions;  that  the  money  he  had  settled  on", "them  had  been  of  great  assistance,  as  it  is\nmuch  easier  to  place  orphans  with  some\nproperty than destitute ones. He said something\ntoo about Sonia and promised to come himself\nin a day or two to see Raskolnikov, mentioning\nthat 'he would like to consult with him, that there\nwere things they must talk over....'\nThis conversation took place in the passage on\nthe  stairs.  Svidrigaïlov  looked  intently  at\nRaskolnikov  and  suddenly,  after  a  brief  pause,\ndropping his voice, asked: 'But how is it, Rodion\nRomanovitch;  you  don't  seem  yourself?  You\nlook  and  you  listen,  but  you  don't  seem  to\nunderstand.  Cheer  up!  We'll  talk  things  over;  I\nam  only  sorry,  I've  so  much  to  do  of  my  own\nbusiness  and  other  people's.  Ah,  Rodion\nRomanovitch,'  he  added  suddenly,  'what  all\nmen  need  is  fresh  air,  fresh  air  ...  more  than\nanything!'\nHe  moved  to  one  side  to  make  way  for  the\npriest  and  server,  who  were  coming  up  the\nstairs. They had come for the requiem service.\nBy Svidrigaïlov's orders it was sung twice a day\npunctually.  Svidrigaïlov  went  his  way.\nRaskolnikov stood still a moment, thought, and", "followed the priest into Sonia's room. He stood\nat  the  door.  They  began  quietly,  slowly  and\nmournfully  singing  the  service.  From  his\nchildhood  the  thought  of  death  and  the\npresence  of  death  had  something  oppressive\nand  mysteriously  awful;  and  it  was  long  since\nhe  had  heard  the  requiem  service.  And  there\nwas something else here as well, too awful and\ndisturbing. He looked at the children: they were\nall  kneeling  by  the  cof-1(cid:24)  fin;  Polenka  was\nweeping. Behind them Sonia prayed, softly and,\nas it were, timidly weeping.\n'These last two days she hasn't said a word to\nme,  she  hasn't  glanced  at  me,'  Raskolnikov\nthought suddenly. The sunlight was bright in the\nroom;  the  incense  rose  in  clouds;  the  priest\nread, 'Give rest, oh Lord....' Raskolnikov stayed\nall through the service. As he blessed them and\ntook  his  leave,  the  priest  looked  round\nstrangely.  After  the  service,  Raskolnikov  went\nup  to  Sonia.  She  took  both  his  hands  and  let\nher  head  sink  on  his  shoulder.  This  slight\nfriendly  gesture  bewildered  Raskolnikov.  It\nseemed strange to him that there was no trace\nof repugnance, no trace of disgust, no tremor in\nher  hand.  It  was  the  furthest  limit  of", "self-abnegation, at least so he interpreted it.\nSonia  said  nothing.  Raskolnikov  pressed  her\nhand and went out. He felt very miserable. If it\nhad been possible to escape to some solitude,\nhe would have thought himself lucky, even if he\nhad to spend his whole life there. But although\nhe  had  almost  always  been  by  himself  of  late,\nhe  had  never  been  able  to  feel  alone.\nSometimes he walked out of the town on to the\nhigh  road,  once  he  had  even  reached  a  little\nwood, but the lonelier the place was, the more\nhe seemed to be aware of an uneasy presence\nnear  him.  It  did  not  frighten  him,  but  greatly\nannoyed him, so that he made haste to return to\nthe  town,  to  mingle  with  the  crowd,  to  enter\nrestaurants  and  taverns,  to  walk  in  busy\nthoroughfares.  There  he  felt  easier  and  even\nmore  solitary.  One  day  at  dusk  he  sat  for  an\nhour  listening  to  songs  in  a  tavern  and  he\nremembered that he positively enjoyed it. But at\nlast he (cid:24)1(cid:24) Crime and Punishment had suddenly\nfelt  the  same  uneasiness  again,  as  though  his\nconscience  smote  him.  'Here  I  sit  listening  to\nsinging,  is  that  what  I  ought  to  be  doing?'  he\nthought. Yet he felt at once that that was not the\nonly  cause  of  his  uneasiness;  there  was", "something  requiring  immediate  decision,  but  it\nwas something he could not clearly understand\nor put into words. It was a hopeless tangle. 'No,\nbetter the struggle again! Better Porfiry again ...\nor  Svidrigaïlov....  Better  some  challenge  again\n... some attack. Yes, yes!' he thought. He went\nout of the tavern and rushed away almost at a\nrun.  The  thought  of  Dounia  and  his  mother\nsuddenly  reduced  him  almost  to  a  panic.  That\nnight he woke up before morning among some\nbushes  in  Krestovsky  Island,  trembling  all  over\nwith  fever;  he  walked  home,  and  it  was  early\nmorning  when  he  arrived.  After  some  hours'\nsleep  the  fever  left  him,  but  he  woke  up  late,\ntwo o'clock in the afternoon.\nHe  remembered  that  Katerina  Ivanovna's\nfuneral  had  been  fixed  for  that  day,  and  was\nglad  that  he  was  not  present  at  it.  Nastasya\nbrought  him  some  food;  he  ate  and  drank  with\nappetite, almost with greediness. His head was\nfresher and he was calmer than he had been for\nthe  last  three  days.  He  even  felt  a  passing\nwonder at his previous attacks of panic.\nThe door opened and Razumihin came in.", "'Ah,  he's  eating,  then  he's  not  ill,'  said\nRazumihin. He took a chair and sat down at the\ntable opposite Raskolnikov.\nHe was troubled and did not attempt to conceal\nit.  He  spoke  with  evident  annoyance,  but\nwithout hurry or raising his voice. He looked as\nthough  he  had  some  special  fixed  1(cid:24)\ndetermination.\n'Listen,'  he  began  resolutely.  'As  far  as  I  am\nconcerned, you may all go to hell, but from what\nI see, it's clear to me that I can't make head or\ntail of it; please don't think I've come to ask you\nquestions.  I  don't  want  to  know,  hang  it!  If  you\nbegin  telling  me  your  secrets,  I  dare  say  I\nshouldn't  stay  to  listen,  I  should  go  away\ncursing. I have only come to find out once for all\nwhether it's a fact that you are mad? There is a\nconviction  in  the  air  that  you  are  mad  or  very\nnearly  so.  I  admit  I've  been  disposed  to  that\nopinion  myself,  judging  from  your  stupid,\nrepulsive  and  quite  inexplicable  actions,  and\nfrom  your  recent  behavior  to  your  mother  and\nsister. Only a monster or a madman could treat\nthem as you have; so you must be mad.'", "'When did you see them last?'\n'Just  now.  Haven't  you  seen  them  since  then?\nWhat  have  you  been  doing  with  yourself?  Tell\nme,  please.  I've  been  to  you  three  times\nalready.  Your  mother  has  been  seriously  ill\nsince yesterday. She had made up her mind to\ncome  to  you;  Avdotya  Romanovna  tried  to\nprevent her; she wouldn't hear a word. 'If he is\nill, if his mind is giving way, who can look after\nhim  like  his  mother?'  she  said.  We  all  came\nhere together, we couldn't let her come alone all\nthe  way.  We  kept  begging  her  to  be  calm.  We\ncame  in,  you  weren't  here;  she  sat  down,  and\nstayed  ten  minutes,  while  we  stood  waiting  in\nsilence. She got up and said: 'If he's gone out,\nthat  is,  if  he  is  well,  and  has  forgotten  his\nmother,  it's  humiliating  and  unseemly  for  his\nmother  to  stand  at  his  door  begging  for\nkindness.'  She  returned  home  and  took  to  her\nbed;  now  she  is  in  a  fever.  'I  (cid:24)1(cid:24)  Crime  and\nPunishment see,' she said, 'that he has time for\nhis  girl.  '  She  means  by  your  girl  Sofya\nSemyonovna, your betrothed or your mistress, I\ndon't  know.  I  went  at  once  to  Sofya\nSemyonovna's, for I wanted to know what was\ngoing  on.  I  looked  round,  I  saw  the  coffin,  the", "children  crying,  and  Sofya  Semyonovna  trying\nthem  on  mourning  dresses.  No  sign  of  you.  I\napologised,  came  away,  and  reported  to\nAvdotya  Romanovna.  So  that's  all  nonsense\nand you haven't got a girl; the most likely thing\nis  that  you  are  mad.  But  here  you  sit,  guzzling\nboiled  beef  as  though  you'd  not  had  a  bite  for\nthree  days.  Though  as  far  as  that  goes,\nmadmen eat too, but though you have not said\na  word  to  me  yet  ...  you  are  not  mad!  That  I'd\nswear! Above all, you are not mad! So you may\ngo to hell, all of you, for there's some mystery,\nsome secret about it, and I don't intend to worry\nmy  brains  over  your  secrets.  So  I've  simply\ncome  to  swear  at  you,'  he  finished,  getting  up,\n'to relieve my mind. And I know what to do now.'\n'What do you mean to do now?'\n'What  business  is  it  of  yours  what  I  mean  to\ndo?'\n'You are going in for a drinking bout.'\n'How ... how did you know?'\n'Why, it's pretty plain.'", "Razumihin paused for a minute.\n'You  always  have  been  a  very  rational  person\nand  you've  never  been  mad,  never,'  he\nobserved suddenly with warmth. 'You're right: I\nshall drink. Good-bye!'\nAnd he moved to go out.\n'I  was  talking  with  my  sister-the  day  before\nyesterday,  I  think  it  was-about  you,\nRazumihin.'1(cid:24) 'About me! But ... where can you\nhave  seen  her  the  day  before    yesterday?' \nRazumihin  stopped  short  and  even turned a\nlittle pale.\nOne  could  see  that  his  heart  was  throbbing\nslowly and violently.\n'She came here by herself, sat there and talked\nto me.'\n'She did!''Yes.'\n'What did you say to her ... I mean, about me?'", "'I  told  her  you  were  a  very  good,  honest,  and\nindustrious  man.  I  didn't  tell  her  you  love  her,\nbecause she knows that herself.'\n'She knows that herself?'\n'Well,  it's  pretty  plain.  Wherever  I  might  go,\nwhatever happened to me, you would remain to\nlook  after  them.  I,  so  to  speak,  give  them  into\nyour  keeping,  Razumihin.  I  say  this  because  I\nknow  quite  well  how  you  love  her,  and  am\nconvinced of the purity of your heart. I know that\nshe  too  may  love  you  and  perhaps  does  love\nyou  already.  Now  decide  for  yourself,  as  you\nknow  best,  whether  you  need  go  in  for  a\ndrinking bout or not.'\n'Rodya!  You  see  ...  well....  Ach,  damn  it!  But\nwhere do you mean to go? Of course, if it's all a\nsecret, never mind.... But I ... I shall find out the\nsecret  ...  and  I  am  sure  that  it  must  be  some\nridiculous nonsense and that you've made it all\nup.  Anyway  you  are  a  capital  fellow,  a  capital\nfellow! ...'\n'That  was  just  what  I  wanted  to  add,  only  you\ninterrupted,  that  that  was  a  very  good  decision", "of yours not to find out these secrets. Leave it to\ntime,  don't  worry  about  it.  You'll  (cid:24)(cid:24)0  Crime  and\nPunishment know it all in time when it must be.\nYesterday  a  man  said  to  me  that  what  a  man\nneeds is fresh air, fresh air, fresh air. I mean to\ngo to him directly to find out what he meant by\nthat.'\nRazumihin stood lost in thought and excitement,\nmaking a silent conclusion.\n'He's  a  political  conspirator!  He  must  be.  And\nhe's on the eve of some desperate step, that's\ncertain. It can only be that! And ... and Dounia\nknows,' he thought suddenly.\n'So Avdotya Romanovna comes to see you,' he\nsaid,  weighing  each  syllable,  'and  you're  going\nto see a man who says we need more air, and\nso  of  course  that  letter  ...  that  too  must  have\nsomething  to  do  with  it,'  he  concluded  to\nhimself.\n'What letter?'\n'She  got  a  letter  to-day.  It  upset  her  very\nmuch-very much indeed. Too much so. I began", "speaking of you, she begged me not to. Then ...\nthen she said that perhaps we should very soon\nhave to part ... then she began warmly thanking\nme  for  something;  then  she  went  to  her  room\nand locked herself in.'\n'She  got  a  letter?'  Raskolnikov  asked\nthoughtfully.\n'Yes, and you didn't know? hm ...'\nThey were both silent.\n'Good-bye,  Rodion.  There  was  a  time,  brother,\nwhen I.... Never mind, good-bye. You see, there\nwas a time.... Well, good-bye! I must be off too.\nI am not going to drink. There's no need now....\nThat's all stuff!'\nHe hurried out; but when he had almost closed\nthe  door  (cid:24)1  behind  him,  he  suddenly  opened  it\nagain, and said, looking away:\n'Oh, by the way, do you remember that murder,\nyou  know  Porfiry's,  that  old  woman?  Do  you\nknow  the  murderer  has  been  found,  he  has\nconfessed  and  given  the  proofs.  It's  one  of", "those very workmen, the painter, only fancy! Do\nyou  remember  I  defended  them  here?  Would\nyou  believe  it,  all  that  scene  of  fighting  and\nlaughing  with  his  companions  on  the  stairs\nwhile  the  porter  and  the  two  witnesses  were\ngoing  up,  he  got  up  on  purpose  to  disarm\nsuspicion. The cunning, the presence of mind of\nthe young dog! One can hardly credit it; but it's\nhis  own  explanation,  he  has  confessed  it  all.\nAnd what a fool I was about it! Well, he's simply\na  genius  of  hypocrisy  and  resourcefulness  in\ndisarming  the  suspicions  of  the  lawyers-so\nthere's  nothing  much  to  wonder  at,  I  suppose!\nOf course people like that are always possible.\nAnd  the  fact  that  he  couldn't  keep  up  the\ncharacter,  but  confessed,  makes  him  easier  to\nbelieve in. But what a fool I was! I was frantic on\ntheir side!'\n'Tell me, please, from whom did you hear that,\nand  why  does  it  interest  you  so?'  Raskolnikov\nasked with unmistakable agitation.\n'What next? You ask me why it interests me! ...\nWell, I heard it from Porfiry, among others ... It\nwas from him I heard almost all about it.'", "'From Porfiry?'\n'From Porfiry.'\n'What ... what did he say?' Raskolnikov asked in\ndismay.\n'He  gave  me  a  capital  explanation  of  it.\nPsychologically, (cid:24) after his fashion.'\n'He explained it? Explained it himself?'\n'Yes,  yes;  good-bye.  I'll  tell  you  all  about  it\nanother  time,  but  now  I'm  busy.  There  was  a\ntime  when  I  fancied  ...  But  no  matter,  another\ntime! ... What need is there for me to drink now?\nYou  have  made  me  drunk  without  wine.  I  am\ndrunk,  Rodya!  Good-bye,  I'm  going.  I'll  come\nagain very soon.'\nHe went out.\n'He's a political conspirator, there's not a doubt\nabout  it,'  Razumihin  decided,  as  he  slowly\ndescended the stairs. 'And he's drawn his sister\nin;  that's  quite,  quite  in  keeping  with  Avdotya\nRomanovna's  character.  There  are  interviews", "between  them!  ...  She  hinted  at  it  too  ...  So\nmany  of  her  words....  and  hints  ...  bear  that\nmeaning!  And  how  else  can  all  this  tangle  be\nexplained?  Hm!  And  I  was  almost  thinking  ...\nGood heavens, what I thought! Yes, I took leave\nof  my  senses  and  I  wronged  him!  It  was  his\ndoing,  under  the  lamp  in  the  corridor  that  day.\nPfoo! What a crude, nasty, vile idea on my part!\nNikolay  is  a  brick,  for  confessing....  And  how\nclear  it  all  is  now!  His  illness  then,  all  his\nstrange actions ... before this, in the university,\nhow morose he used to be, how gloomy.... But\nwhat's  the  meaning  now  of  that  letter?  There's\nsomething  in  that,  too,  perhaps.  Whom  was  it\nfrom? I suspect ...! No, I must find out!'\nHe thought of Dounia, realising all he had heard\nand his heart throbbed, and he suddenly broke\ninto a run.\nAs  soon  as  Razumihin  went  out,  Raskolnikov\ngot  up,  turned  to  the  window,  walked  into  one\ncorner  and  then  into  (cid:24)(cid:24)  another,  as  though\nforgetting  the  smallness  of  his  room,  and  sat\ndown  again  on  the  sofa.  He  felt,  so  to  speak,\nrenewed;  again  the  struggle,  so  a  means  of\nescape had come.", "'Yes, a means of escape had come! It had been\ntoo stifling, too cramping, the burden had been\ntoo agonising. A lethargy had come upon him at\ntimes.  From  the  moment  of  the  scene  with\nNikolay  at  Porfiry's  he  had  been  suffocating,\npenned  in  without  hope  of  escape.  After\nNikolay's  confession,  on  that  very  day  had\ncome  the  scene  with  Sonia;  his  behaviour  and\nhis  last  words  had  been  utterly  unlike  anything\nhe  could  have  imagined  beforehand;  he  had\ngrown feebler, instantly and fundamentally! And\nhe  had  agreed  at  the  time  with  Sonia,  he  had\nagreed  in  his  heart  he  could  not  go  on  living\nalone with such a thing on his mind!\n'And  Svidrigaïlov  was  a  riddle  ...  He  worried\nhim,  that  was  true,  but  somehow  not  on  the\nsame  point.  He  might  still  have  a  struggle  to\ncome  with  Svidrigaïlov.  Svidrigaïlov,  too,  might\nbe  a  means  of  escape;  but  Porfiry  was  a\ndifferent matter.\n'And  so  Porfiry  himself  had  explained  it  to\nRazumihin, had explained it psychologically. He\nhad  begun  bringing  in  his  damned  psychology\nagain!  Porfiry?  But  to  think  that  Porfiry  should", "for one moment believe that Nikolay was guilty,\nafter  what  had  passed  between  them  before\nNikolay's  appearance,  after  that  tête-à-tête\ninterview,  which  could  have  only  one\nexplanation?  (During  those  days  Raskolnikov\nhad often recalled passages in that scene with\nPorfiry; he could not bear to let his mind rest on\nit.)  Such  words,  such  gestures  had  passed\nbetween  them,  they  had  exchanged  (cid:24)  such\nglances,  things  had  been  said  in  such  a  tone\nand  had  reached  such  a  pass,  that  Nikolay,\nwhom Porfiry had seen through at the first word,\nat  the  first  gesture,  could  not  have  shaken  his\nconviction.\n'And to think that even Razumihin had begun to\nsuspect!  The  scene  in  the  corridor  under  the\nlamp  had  produced  its  effect  then.  He  had\nrushed  to  Porfiry....  But  what  had  induced  the\nlatter  to  receive  him  like  that?  What  had  been\nhis object in putting Razumihin off with Nikolay?\nHe  must  have  some  plan;  there  was  some\ndesign, but what was it? It was true that a long\ntime had passed since that morning-too long a\ntime-and  no  sight  nor  sound  of  Porfiry.  Well,\nthat was a bad sign....'", "Raskolnikov  took  his  cap  and  went  out  of  the\nroom,  still  pondering.  It  was  the  first  time  for  a\nlong while that he had felt clear in his mind, at\nleast.  'I  must  settle  Svidrigaïlov,'  he  thought,\n'and as soon as possible; he, too, seems to be\nwaiting  for  me  to  come  to  him  of  my  own\naccord.'  And  at  that  moment  there  was  such  a\nrush  of  hate  in  his  weary  heart  that  he  might\nhave  killed  either  of  those  two-Porfiry  or\nSvidrigaïlov.  At  least  he  felt  that  he  would  be\ncapable of doing it later, if not now.\n'We  shall  see,  we  shall  see,'  he  repeated  to\nhimself.\nBut no sooner had he opened the door than he\nstumbled  upon  Porfiry  himself  in  the  passage.\nHe was coming in to see him. Raskolnikov was\ndumbfounded  for  a  minute,  but  only  for  one\nminute.  Strange  to  say,  he  was  not  very  much\nastonished at seeing Porfiry and scarcely afraid\nof him. He was simply startled, but was quickly,\ninstantly, on his guard. (cid:24)(cid:24) 'Perhaps this will mean\nthe  end?  But  how  could  Porfiry  have\napproached so quietly, like a cat, so that he had\nheard nothing? Could he have been listening at\nthe door?'", "'You  didn't  expect  a  visitor,  Rodion\nRomanovitch,'  Porfiry  explained,  laughing.  'I've\nbeen  meaning  to  look  in  a  long  time;  I  was\npassing  by  and  thought  why  not  go  in  for  five\nminutes.  Are  you  going  out?  I  won't  keep  you\nlong. Just let me have one cigarette.'\n'Sit  down,  Porfiry  Petrovitch,  sit  down.'\nRaskolnikov  gave  his  visitor  a  seat  with  so\npleased  and  friendly  an  expression  that  he\nwould  have  marvelled  at  himself,  if  he  could\nhave seen it.\nThe last moment had come, the last drops had\nto  be  drained!  So  a  man  will  sometimes  go\nthrough  half  an  hour  of  mortal  terror  with  a\nbrigand,  yet  when  the  knife  is  at  his  throat  at\nlast, he feels no fear.\nRaskolnikov  seated  himself  directly  facing\nPorfiry,  and  looked  at  him  without  flinching.\nPorfiry screwed up his eyes and began lighting\na cigarette.\n'Speak,  speak,'  seemed  as  though  it  would\nburst from ", "Raskolnikov's  heart.  'Come,  why  don't  you\nspeak?'(cid:24) ", "#$#$Chapter 38#$#$\n'Ah  these  cigarettes!'  Porfiry  Petrovitch\nejaculated at last, having lighted one. 'They are\npernicious, positively pernicious, and yet I can't\ngive them up! I cough, I begin to have tickling in\nmy throat and a difficulty in breathing. You know\nI  am  a  coward,  I  went  lately  to  Dr.  B--n;  he\nalways  gives  at  least  half  an  hour  to  each\npatient. He positively laughed looking at me; he\nsounded  me:  'Tobacco's  bad  for  you,'  he  said,\n'your lungs are affected.' But how am I to give it\nup? What is there to take its place? I don't drink,\nthat's  the  mischief,  he-he-he,  that  I  don't.\nEverything  is  relative,  Rodion  Romanovitch,\neverything is relative!'\n'Why, he's playing his professional tricks again,'\nRaskolnikov  thought  with  disgust.  All  the\ncircumstances  of  their  last  interview  suddenly\ncame  back  to  him,  and  he  felt  a  rush  of  the\nfeeling that had come upon him then.\n'I came to see you the day before yesterday, in\nthe evening; you didn't know?' Porfiry Petrovitch", "went  on,  looking  round  the  room.  'I  came  into\nthis  very  room.  I  was  passing  by,  just  as  I  did\nto-day,  and  I  thought  I'd  return  your  call.  I\nwalked in as your door was wide open, I looked\nround, waited and went out without leaving my\nname  with  your  servant.  Don't  you  lock  your\ndoor?'\nRaskolnikov's  face  grew  more  and  more\ngloomy.  Porfiry  seemed  to  guess  his  state  of\nmind.(cid:24)(cid:24)  'I've  come  to  have  it  out  with  you,\nRodion Romanovitch, my dear fellow! I owe you\nan  explanation  and  must  give  it  to  you,'  he\ncontinued  with  a  slight  smile,  just  patting\nRaskolnikov's knee.\nBut  almost  at  the  same  instant  a  serious  and\ncareworn  look  came  into  his  face;  to  his\nsurprise Raskolnikov saw a touch of sadness in\nit.  He  had  never  seen  and  never  suspected\nsuch an expression in his face.\n'A  strange  scene  passed  between  us  last  time\nwe  met,  Rodion  Romanovitch.  Our  first\ninterview,  too,  was  a  strange  one;  but  then  ...\nand one thing after another! This is the point: I\nhave perhaps acted unfairly to you; I feel it. Do", "you  remember  how  we  parted?  Your  nerves\nwere  unhinged  and  your  knees  were  shaking\nand  so  were  mine.  And,  you  know,  our\nbehaviour  was  unseemly,  even  ungentlemanly.\nAnd  yet  we  are  gentlemen,  above  all,  in  any\ncase,  gentlemen;  that  must  be  understood.  Do\nyou remember what we came to? ... and it was\nquite indecorous.'\n'What  is  he  up  to,  what  does  he  take  me  for?'\nRaskolnikov  asked  himself  in  amazement,\nraising his head and looking with open eyes on\nPorfiry.'I've    decided    openness    is    better \nbetween    us,'    Porfiry  Petrovitch  went  on,\nturning  his  head  away  and  dropping  his  eyes,\nas  though  unwilling  to  disconcert  his  former\nvictim  and  as  though  disdaining  his  former\nwiles.  'Yes,  such  suspicions  and  such  scenes\ncannot  continue  for  long.  Nikolay  put  a  stop  to\nit, or I don't know what we might not have come\nto.  That  damned  workman  was  sitting  at  the\ntime in the next room-can you realise that? You\nknow that, of (cid:24) course; and I am aware that he\ncame  to  you  afterwards.  But  what  you\nsupposed then was not true: I had not sent for\nanyone,  I  had  made  no  kind  of  arrangements.\nYou ask why I hadn't? What shall I say to you?", "it  had  all  come  upon  me  so  suddenly.  I  had\nscarcely sent for the porters (you noticed them\nas  you  went  out,  I  dare  say).  An  idea  flashed\nupon  me;  I  was  firmly  convinced  at  the  time,\nyou  see,  Rodion  Romanovitch.  Come,  I\nthought-even  if  I  let  one  thing  slip  for  a  time,  I\nshall  get  hold  of  something  else-I  shan't  lose\nwhat  I  want,  anyway.  You  are  nervously\nirritable, Rodion Romanovitch, by temperament;\nit's out of proportion with other qualities of your\nheart and character, which I flatter myself I have\nto  some  extent  divined.  Of  course  I  did  reflect\neven then that it does not always happen that a\nman  gets  up  and  blurts  out  his  whole  story.  It\ndoes  happen  sometimes,  if  you  make  a  man\nlose  all  patience,  though  even  then  it's  rare.  I\nwas  capable  of  realising  that.  If  I  only  had  a\nfact,  I  thought,  the  least  little  fact  to  go  upon,\nsomething  I  could  lay  hold  of,  something\ntangible, not merely psychological. For if a man\nis  guilty,  you  must  be  able  to  get  something\nsubstantial  out  of  him;  one  may  reckon  upon\nmost surprising results indeed. I was reckoning\non your temperament, Rodion Romanovitch, on\nyour temperament above all things! I had great\nhopes of you at that time.'", "'But what are you driving at now?' Raskolnikov\nmuttered  at  last,  asking  the  question  without\nthinking.\n'What  is  he  talking  about?'  he  wondered\ndistractedly,  'does  he  really  take  me  to  be\ninnocent?'\n'What  am  I  driving  at?  I've  come  to  explain\nmyself,  I  con-(cid:24)(cid:24)  sider  it  my  duty,  so  to  speak.  I\nwant  to  make  clear  to  you  how  the  whole\nbusiness,  the  whole  misunderstanding  arose.\nI've  caused  you  a  great  deal  of  suffering,\nRodion  Romanovitch.  I  am  not  a  monster.  I\nunderstand  what  it  must  mean  for  a  man  who\nhas  been  unfortunate,  but  who  is  proud,\nimperious  and  above  all,  impatient,  to  have  to\nbear  such  treatment!  I  regard  you  in  any  case\nas  a  man  of  noble  character  and  not  without\nelements  of  magnanimity,  though  I  don't  agree\nwith all your convictions. I wanted to tell you this\nfirst,  frankly  and  quite  sincerely,  for  above  all  I\ndon't  want  to  deceive  you.  When  I  made  your\nacquaintance,  I  felt  attracted  by  you.  Perhaps\nyou will laugh at my saying so. You have a right\nto.  I  know  you  disliked  me  from  the  first  and\nindeed  you've  no  reason  to  like  me.  You  may", "think what you like, but I desire now to do all I\ncan to efface that impression and to show that I\nam  a  man  of  heart  and  conscience.  I  speak\nsincerely.'\nPorfiry  Petrovitch  made  a  dignified  pause.\nRaskolnikov  felt  a  rush  of  renewed  alarm.  The\nthought that Porfiry believed him to be innocent\nbegan to make him uneasy.\n'It's scarcely necessary to go over everything in\ndetail,' \nPorfiry  Petrovitch  went  on.  'Indeed,  I  could\nscarcely  attempt  it.  To  begin  with  there  were\nrumours. Through whom, how, and when those\nrumours  came  to  me  ...  and  how  they  affected\nyou,  I  need  not  go  into.  My  suspicions  were\naroused  by  a  complete  accident,  which  might\njust as easily not have happened. What was it?\nHm!  I  believe  there  is  no  need  to  go  into  that\neither.  Those  rumours  and  that  accident  led  to\none  idea  in  my  mind.  I  admit  it  openly-for  one\nmay as well (cid:24)(cid:24)0 Crime and Punishment make a\nclean breast of it-I was the first to pitch on you.\nThe old woman's notes on the pledges and the\nrest  of  it-that  all  came  to  nothing.  Yours  was", "one  of  a  hundred.  I  happened,  too,  to  hear  of\nthe  scene  at  the  office,  from  a  man  who\ndescribed  it  capitally,  unconsciously\nreproducing  the  scene  with  great  vividness.  It\nwas  just  one  thing  after  another,  Rodion\nRomanovitch, my dear fellow! How could I avoid\nbeing brought to certain ideas? From a hundred\nrabbits  you  can't  make  a  horse,  a  hundred\nsuspicions  don't  make  a  proof,  as  the  English\nproverb  says,  but  that's  only  from  the  rational\npoint  of  view-you  can't  help  being  partial,  for\nafter all a lawyer is only human. I thought, too,\nof your article in that journal, do you remember,\non your first visit we talked of it? I jeered at you\nat the time, but that was only to lead you on. I\nrepeat,  Rodion  Romanovitch,  you  are  ill  and\nimpatient.  That  you  were  bold,  headstrong,  in\nearnest and ... had felt a great deal I recognised\nlong  before.  I,  too,  have  felt  the  same,  so  that\nyour  article  seemed  familiar  to  me.  It  was\nconceived on sleepless nights, with a throbbing\nheart,  in  ecstasy  and  suppressed  enthusiasm.\nAnd  that  proud  suppressed  enthusiasm  in\nyoung  people  is  dangerous!  I  jeered  at  you\nthen,  but  let  me  tell  you  that,  as  a  literary\namateur, I am awfully fond of such first essays,\nfull  of  the  heat  of  youth.  There  is  a  mistiness", "and a chord vibrating in the mist. Your article is\nabsurd  and  fantastic,  but  there's  a  transparent\nsincerity,  a  youthful  incorruptible  pride  and  the\ndaring of despair in it. It's a gloomy article, but\nthat's what's fine in it. I read your article and put\nit aside, thinking as I did so 'that man won't go\nthe common way.' Well, I ask you, after that as\na prelimi-(cid:24)1 nary, how could I help being carried\naway  by  what  followed?  Oh,  dear,  I  am  not\nsaying anything, I am not making any statement\nnow. I simply noted it at the time. What is there\nin  it?  I  reflected.  There's  nothing  in  it,  that  is\nreally  nothing  and  perhaps  absolutely  nothing.\nAnd it's not at all the thing for the prosecutor to\nlet  himself  be  carried  away  by  notions:  here  I\nhave Nikolay on my hands with actual evidence\nagainst  him-you  may  think  what  you  like  of  it,\nbut  it's  evidence.  He  brings  in  his  psychology,\ntoo;  one  has  to  consider  him,  too,  for  it's  a\nmatter  of  life  and  death.  Why  am  I  explaining\nthis to you? That you may understand, and not\nblame my malicious behaviour on that occasion.\nIt  was  not  malicious,  I  assure  you,  he-he!  Do\nyou suppose I didn't come to search your room\nat the time? I did, I did, he-he! I was here when\nyou were lying ill in bed, not officially, not in my\nown  person,  but  I  was  here.  Your  room  was", "searched to the last thread at the first suspicion;\nbut umsonst! I thought to myself, now that man\nwill come, will come of himself and quickly, too;\nif  he's  guilty,  he's  sure  to  come.  Another  man\nwouldn't,  but  he  will.  And  you  remember  how\nMr.  Razumihin  began  discussing  the  subject\nwith you? We arranged that to excite you, so we\npurposely  spread  rumours,  that  he  might\ndiscuss the case with you, and Razumihin is not\na  man  to  restrain  his  indignation.  Mr.  Zametov\nwas  tremendously  struck  by  your  anger  and\nyour  open  daring.  Think  of  blurting  out  in  a\nrestaurant  'I  killed  her.'  It  was  too  daring,  too\nreckless.  I  thought  so  myself,  if  he  is  guilty  he\nwill be a formidable opponent. That was what I\nthought  at  the  time.  I  was  expecting  you.  But\nyou simply bowled Za(cid:24) metov over and ... well,\nyou  see,  it  all  lies  in  this-that  this  damnable\npsychology can be taken two ways! Well, I kept\nexpecting  you,  and  so  it  was,  you  came!  My\nheart was fairly throbbing. Ach!\n'Now, why need you have come? Your laughter,\ntoo, as you came in, do you remember? I saw it\nall plain as daylight, but if I hadn't expected you\nso specially, I should not have noticed anything\nin  your  laughter.  You  see  what  influence  a", "mood  has!  Mr.  Razumihin  then-ah,  that  stone,\nthat stone under which the things were hidden! I\nseem to see it somewhere in a kitchen garden.\nIt  was  in  a  kitchen  garden,  you  told  Zametov\nand afterwards you repeated that in my office?\nAnd  when  we  began  picking  your  article  to\npieces,  how  you  explained  it!  One  could  take\nevery  word  of  yours  in  two  senses,  as  though\nthere were another meaning hidden.\n'So in this way, Rodion Romanovitch, I reached\nthe furthest limit, and knocking my head against\na post, I pulled myself up, asking myself what I\nwas about. After all, I said, you can take it all in\nanother sense if you like, and it's more natural\nso, indeed. I couldn't help admitting it was more\nnatural. I was bothered! 'No, I'd better get hold\nof some little fact' I said. So when I heard of the\nbell-ringing,  I  held  my  breath  and  was  all  in  a\ntremor.  'Here  is  my  little  fact,'  thought  I,  and  I\ndidn't  think  it  over,  I  simply  wouldn't.  I  would\nhave given a thousand roubles at that minute to\nhave  seen  you  with  my  own  eyes,  when  you\nwalked a hundred paces beside that workman,\nafter  he  had  called  you  murderer  to  your  face,\nand you did not dare to ask him a question all\nthe  way.  And  then  what  about  your  trembling,", "what (cid:24)(cid:24) about your bell-ringing in your illness, in\nsemi-delirium?\n'And so, Rodion Romanovitch, can you wonder\nthat  I  played  such  pranks  on  you?  And  what\nmade you come at that very minute? Someone\nseemed  to  have  sent  you,  by  Jove!  And  if\nNikolay  had  not  parted  us  ...  and  do  you\nremember  Nikolay  at  the  time?  Do  you\nremember  him  clearly?  It  was  a  thunderbolt,  a\nregular thunderbolt! And how I met him! I didn't\nbelieve in the thunderbolt, not for a minute. You\ncould see it for yourself; and how could I? Even\nafterwards,  when  you  had  gone  and  he  began\nmaking very, very plausible answers on certain\npoints,  so  that  I  was  surprised  at  him  myself,\neven  then  I  didn't  believe  his  story!  You  see\nwhat it is to be as firm as a rock! No, thought I,\nMorgenfrüh. What has Nikolay got to do with it!'\n'Razumihin  told  me  just  now  that  you  think\nNikolay  guilty  and  had  yourself  assured  him  of\nit....'\nHis  voice  failed  him,  and  he  broke  off.  He  had\nbeen listening in indescribable agitation, as this\nman  who  had  seen  through  and  through  him,", "went  back  upon  himself.  He  was  afraid  of\nbelieving  it  and  did  not  believe  it.  In  those  still\nambiguous  words  he  kept  eagerly  looking  for\nsomething more definite and conclusive.\n'Mr.  Razumihin!'  cried  Porfiry  Petrovitch,\nseeming  glad  of  a  question  from  Raskolnikov,\nwho  had  till  then  been  silent.  'He-he-he!  But  I\nhad  to  put  Mr.  Razumihin  off;  two  is  company,\nthree  is  none.  Mr.  Razumihin  is  not  the  right\nman,  besides  he  is  an  outsider.  He  came\nrunning  to  me  with  a  pale  face....  But  never\nmind  him,  why  bring  him  in?  To  return  to\nNikolay, would you like to know what sort of a (cid:24)\ntype  he  is,  how  I  understand  him,  that  is?  To\nbegin  with,  he  is  still  a  child  and  not  exactly  a\ncoward,  but  something  by  way  of  an  artist.\nReally, don't laugh at my describing him so. He\nis innocent and responsive to influence. He has\na heart, and is a fantastic fellow. He sings and\ndances, he tells stories, they say, so that people\ncome  from  other  villages  to  hear  him.  He\nattends school too, and laughs till he cries if you\nhold  up  a  finger  to  him;  he  will  drink  himself\nsenseless-not  as  a  regular  vice,  but  at  times,\nwhen  people  treat  him,  like  a  child.  And  he\nstole,  too,  then,  without  knowing  it  himself,  for", "'How can it be stealing, if one picks it up?' And\ndo you know he is an Old Believer, or rather a\ndissenter? There have been Wanderers[*] in his\nfamily,  and  he  was  for  two  years  in  his  village\nunder the spiritual guidance of a certain elder. I\nlearnt  all  this  from  Nikolay  and  from  his  fellow\nvillagers.  And  what's  more,  he  wanted  to  run\ninto  the  wilderness!  He  was  full  of  fervour,\nprayed  at  night,  read  the  old  books,  'the  true'\nones, and read himself crazy.\n[*] A religious sect.-TRANSLATOR'S NOTE.\n'Petersburg  had  a  great  effect  upon  him,\nespecially  the  women  and  the  wine.  He\nresponds  to  everything  and  he  forgot  the  elder\nand  all  that.  I  learnt  that  an  artist  here  took  a\nfancy to him, and used to go and see him, and\nnow this business came upon him.\n'Well,  he  was  frightened,  he  tried  to  hang\nhimself! He ran away! How can one get over the\nidea  the  people  have  of  Russian  legal\nproceedings?  The  very  word  'trial'  frightens\nsome  of  them.  Whose  fault  is  it?  We  shall  see\nwhat  the  new  juries  will  do.  God  grant  they  do\ngood!  Well,  in  prison,  it  (cid:24)(cid:24)  seems,  he", "remembered the venerable elder; the Bible, too,\nmade  its  appearance  again.  Do  you  know,\nRodion  Romanovitch,  the  force  of  the  word\n'suffering' among some of these people! It's not\na  question  of  suffering  for  someone's  benefit,\nbut simply, 'one must suffer.' If they suffer at the\nhands of the authorities, so much the better. In\nmy  time  there  was  a  very  meek  and  mild\nprisoner  who  spent  a  whole  year  in  prison\nalways  reading  his  Bible  on  the  stove  at  night\nand he read himself crazy, and so crazy, do you\nknow,  that  one  day,  apropos  of  nothing,  he\nseized  a  brick  and  flung  it  at  the  governor;\nthough he had done him no harm. And the way\nhe threw it too: aimed it a yard on one side on\npurpose, for fear of hurting him. Well, we know\nwhat  happens  to  a  prisoner  who  assaults  an\nofficer with a weapon. So 'he took his suffering.'\n'So I suspect now that Nikolay wants to take his\nsuffering or something of the sort. I know it for\ncertain from facts, indeed. Only he doesn't know\nthat I know. What, you don't admit that there are\nsuch  fantastic  people  among  the  peasants?\nLots  of  them.  The  elder  now  has  begun\ninfluencing  him,  especially  since  he  tried  to\nhang  himself.  But  he'll  come  and  tell  me  all", "himself. You think he'll hold out? Wait a bit, he'll\ntake his words back. I am waiting from hour to\nhour for him to come and abjure his evidence. I\nhave come to like that Nikolay and am studying\nhim in detail. And what do you think? He-he! He\nanswered me very plausibly on some points, he\nobviously  had  collected  some  evidence  and\nprepared  himself  cleverly.  But  on  other  points\nhe is simply at sea, knows nothing and doesn't\neven suspect that (cid:24) he doesn't know!\n'No,  Rodion  Romanovitch,  Nikolay  doesn't\ncome in! This is a fantastic, gloomy business, a\nmodern  case,  an  incident  of  to-day  when  the\nheart  of  man  is  troubled,  when  the  phrase  is\nquoted  that  blood  'renews,'  when  comfort  is\npreached  as  the  aim  of  life.  Here  we  have\nbookish  dreams,  a  heart  unhinged  by  theories.\nHere  we  see  resolution  in  the  first  stage,  but\nresolution of a special kind: he resolved to do it\nlike  jumping  over  a  precipice  or  from  a  bell\ntower  and  his  legs  shook  as  he  went  to  the\ncrime. He forgot to shut the door after him, and\nmurdered  two  people  for  a  theory.  He\ncommitted  the  murder  and  couldn't  take  the\nmoney,  and  what  he  did  manage  to  snatch  up\nhe hid under a stone. It wasn't enough for him", "to  suffer  agony  behind  the  door  while  they\nbattered  at  the  door  and  rung  the  bell,  no,  he\nhad to go to the empty lodging, half delirious, to\nrecall the bellringing, he wanted to feel the cold\nshiver  over  again....  Well,  that  we  grant,  was\nthrough  illness,  but  consider  this:  he  is  a\nmurderer, but looks upon himself as an honest\nman,  despises  others,  poses  as  injured\ninnocence. No, that's not the work of a Nikolay,\nmy dear Rodion Romanovitch!'\nAll  that  had  been  said  before  had  sounded  so\nlike  a  recantation  that  these  words  were  too\ngreat  a  shock.  Raskolnikov  shuddered  as\nthough he had been stabbed.\n'Then ... who then ... is the murderer?' he asked\nin a breathless voice, unable to restrain himself.\nPorfiry  Petrovitch  sank  back  in  his  chair,  as\nthough he were amazed at the question.\n'Who is the murderer?' he repeated, as though\nunable to (cid:24)(cid:24) believe his ears. 'Why, you Rodion\nRomanovitch! You are the murderer,' he added,\nalmost  in  a  whisper,  in  a  voice  of  genuine\nconviction.", "Raskolnikov leapt from the sofa, stood up for a\nfew  seconds  and  sat  down  again  without\nuttering a word. His face twitched convulsively.\n'Your lip is twitching just as it did before,' Porfiry\nPetrovitch  observed  almost  sympathetically. \n'You've    been  misunderstanding  me,  I  think,\nRodion  Romanovitch,'  he  added  after  a  brief\npause, 'that's why you are so surprised. I came\non  purpose  to  tell  you  everything  and  deal\nopenly with you.'\n'It  was  not  I  murdered  her,'  Raskolnikov\nwhispered  like  a  frightened  child  caught  in  the\nact.\n'No,  it  was  you,  you  Rodion  Romanovitch,  and\nno  one  else,'  Porfiry  whispered  sternly,  with\nconviction.\nThey  were  both  silent  and  the  silence  lasted\nstrangely  long,  about  ten  minutes.  Raskolnikov\nput  his  elbow  on  the  table  and  passed  his\nfingers  through  his  hair.  Porfiry  Petrovitch  sat\nquietly  waiting.  Suddenly  Raskolnikov  looked\nscornfully at Porfiry.", "'You  are  at  your  old  tricks  again,  Porfiry\nPetrovitch!  Your  old  method  again.  I  wonder\nyou don't get sick of it!'\n'Oh,  stop  that,  what  does  that  matter  now?  It\nwould  be  a  different  matter  if  there  were\nwitnesses present, but we are whispering alone.\nYou see yourself that I have not come to chase\nand  capture  you  like  a  hare.  Whether  you\nconfess  it  or  not  is  nothing  to  me  now;  for\nmyself,  I  am  convinced  without  it.'(cid:24)  'If  so,  what\ndid you come for?' Raskolnikov asked irritably. 'I\nask  you  the  same  question  again:  if  you\nconsider  me  guilty,  why  don't  you  take  me  to\nprison?'\n'Oh,  that's  your  question!  I  will  answer  you,\npoint for point. In the first place, to arrest you so\ndirectly is not to my interest.'\n'How so? If you are convinced you ought....'\n'Ach,  what  if  I  am  convinced?  That's  only  my\ndream  for  the  time.  Why  should  I  put  you  in\nsafety? You know that's it, since you ask me to\ndo  it.  If  I  confront  you  with  that  workman  for", "instance and you say to him 'were you drunk or\nnot?  Who  saw  me  with  you?  I  simply  took  you\nto  be  drunk,  and  you  were  drunk,  too.'  Well,\nwhat could I answer, especially as your story is\na  more  likely  one  than  his?  for  there's  nothing\nbut  psychology  to  support  his  evidence-that's\nalmost  unseemly  with  his  ugly  mug,  while  you\nhit  the  mark  exactly,  for  the  rascal  is  an\ninveterate  drunkard  and  notoriously  so.  And  I\nhave  myself  admitted  candidly  several  times\nalready  that  that  psychology  can  be  taken  in\ntwo  ways  and  that  the  second  way  is  stronger\nand  looks  far  more  probable,  and  that  apart\nfrom that I have as yet nothing against you. And\nthough I shall put you in prison and indeed have\ncome-quite contrary to etiquette-to inform you of\nit beforehand, yet I tell you frankly, also contrary\nto  etiquette,  that  it  won't  be  to  my  advantage.\nWell, secondly, I've come to you because ...'\n'Yes, yes, secondly?' Raskolnikov was listening\nbreathless.\n'Because,  as  I  told  you  just  now,  I  consider  I\nowe  you  an  (cid:24)(cid:24)  explanation.  I  don't  want  you  to\nlook  upon  me  as  a  monster,  as  I  have  a\ngenuine  liking  for  you,  you  may  believe  me  or", "not. And in the third place I've come to you with\na  direct  and  open  proposition-that  you  should\nsurrender and confess. It will be infinitely more\nto your advantage and to my advantage too, for\nmy task will be done. Well, is this open on my\npart or not?'\nRaskolnikov thought a minute.\n'Listen, Porfiry Petrovitch. You said just now you\nhave nothing but psychology to go on, yet now\nyou've gone on mathematics. Well, what if you\nare mistaken yourself, now?'\n'No, Rodion Romanovitch, I am not mistaken. I\nhave  a  little  fact  even  then,  Providence  sent  it\nme.'\n'What little fact?'\n'I won't tell you what, Rodion Romanovitch. And\nin any case, I haven't the right to put it off any\nlonger,  I  must  arrest  you.  So  think  it  over:  it\nmakes no difference to me now and so I speak\nonly for your sake. Believe me, it will be better,\nRodion Romanovitch.'", "Raskolnikov smiled malignantly.\n'That's  not  simply  ridiculous,  it's  positively\nshameless.  Why,  even  if  I  were  guilty,  which  I\ndon't  admit,  what  reason  should  I  have  to\nconfess,  when  you  tell  me  yourself  that  I  shall\nbe in greater safety in prison?'\n'Ah,  Rodion  Romanovitch,  don't  put  too  much\nfaith  in  words,  perhaps  prison  will  not  be\naltogether a restful place. That's only theory and\nmy  theory,  and  what  authority  am  I  for  you?\nPerhaps, too, even now I am hiding something\n(cid:24)(cid:24)0 Crime and Punishment from you? I can't lay\nbare  everything,  he-he!  And  how  can  you  ask\nwhat advantage? Don't you know how it would\nlessen  your  sentence?

I  swear  before\nGod  that  I  will  so  arrange  that  your  confession\nshall  come  as  a  complete  surprise.  We  will\nmake a clean sweep of all these psychological\npoints, of a suspicion against you, so that your\ncrime  will  appear  to  have  been  something  like\nan aberration, for in truth it was an aberration.

He pondered a long\nwhile and at last smiled again, but his smile was\nsad and gentle.\n'No!' he said, apparently abandoning all attempt\nto  keep  up  appearances  with  Porfiry,  'it's  not\nworth  it,  I  don't  care  about  lessening  the\nsentence!'\n'That's  just  what  I  was  afraid  of!'  Porfiry  cried\nwarmly and, as it seemed, involuntarily. 'That's\njust what I feared, that you wouldn't care about\nthe mitigation of sentence.'\nRaskolnikov  looked  sadly  and  expressively  at\nhim.\n'Ah,  don't  disdain  life!'  Porfiry  went  on.  'You\nhave a great deal of it still before you. How can\nyou  say  you  don't  want  a  mitigation  of\nsentence? You are an impatient fellow!'\n'A great deal of what lies before me?'", "'Of  life.

Raskolnikov  whispered  with\nloathing  and  contempt,  as  though  he  did  not\nwant to speak aloud.\nHe  got  up  again  as  though  he  meant  to  go\naway, but sat down again in evident despair.\n'Hang  it,  if  you  like!  You've  lost  faith  and  you\nthink  that  I  am  grossly  flattering  you;  but  how\nlong  has  your  life  been?  How  much  do  you\nunderstand?  You  made  up  a  theory  and  then\nwere  ashamed  that  it  broke  down  and  turned\nout  to  be  not  at  all  original!

You\nhave  long  needed  a  change  of  air.  Suffering,\ntoo,  is  a  good  thing.  Suffer!  Maybe  Nikolay  is\nright  in  wanting  to  suffer.  I  know  you  don't\nbelieve in it-but don't be over-wise; fling yourself\nstraight  into  life,  without  deliberation;  don't  be\nafraid-the flood will bear you to the bank and set\nyou  safe  on  your  feet  again.  What  bank?  How\ncan I tell? I only believe that you have long life\nbefore  you.  I  know  that  you  take  all  my  words\nnow for a set speech prepared beforehand, but\nmaybe you will remember them after. They may\nbe of use some (cid:24) time. That's why I speak. It's\nas  well  that  you  only  killed  the  old  woman.  If\nyou'd  invented  another  theory  you  might\nperhaps  have  done  something  a  thousand\ntimes  more  hideous.  You  ought  to  thank  God,\nperhaps.  How  do  you  know?  Perhaps  God  is\nsaving  you  for  something.  But  keep  a  good\nheart and have less fear!

At my being such a Schiller?\nI  bet  you're  imagining  that  I  am  trying  to  get\nround  you  by  flattery.  Well,  perhaps  I  am,\nhe-he-he! Perhaps you'd better (cid:24)(cid:24) not believe my\nword,  perhaps  you'd  better  never  believe  it\naltogether-I'm  made  that  way,  I  confess  it.  But\nlet  me  add,  you  can  judge  for  yourself,  I  think,\nhow far I am a base sort of man and how far I\nam honest.'\n'When do you mean to arrest me?'\n'Well,  I  can  let  you  walk  about  another  day  or\ntwo.  Think  it  over,  my  dear  fellow,  and  pray  to\nGod. It's more in your interest, believe me.'\n'And  what  if  I  run  away?'  asked  Raskolnikov\nwith a strange smile.\n'No,  you  won't  run  away.  A  peasant  would  run\naway, a fashionable dissenter would run away,\nthe flunkey of another man's thought, for you've\nonly to show him the end of your little finger and\nhe'll be ready to believe in anything for the rest\nof his life. But you've ceased to believe in your\ntheory  already,  what  will  you  run  away  with?\nAnd  what  would  you  do  in  hiding?  It  would  be", "hateful and difficult for you, and what you need\nmore than anything in life is a definite position,\nan  atmosphere  to  suit  you.  And  what  sort  of\natmosphere  would  you  have?  If  you  ran  away,\nyou'd  come  back  to  yourself.  You  can't  get  on\nwithout us. And if I put you in prison-say you've\nbeen there a month, or two, or three-remember\nmy word, you'll confess of yourself and perhaps\nto  your  own  surprise.  You  won't  know  an  hour\nbeforehand  that  you  are  coming  with  a\nconfession. I am convinced that you will decide,\n'to  take  your  suffering.'  You  don't  believe  my\nwords now, but you'll come to it of yourself. For\nsuffering, Rodion Romanovitch, is a great thing.\nNever mind my having grown fat, I know all the\nsame.  Don't  laugh  at  it,  (cid:24)  there's  an  idea  in\nsuffering,  Nokolay  is  right.  No,  you  won't  run\naway, Rodion Romanovitch.'\nRaskolnikov  got  up  and  took  his  cap.  Porfiry\nPetrovitch also rose.\n'Are you going for a walk? The evening will be\nfine,  if  only  we  don't  have  a  storm.  Though  it\nwould be a good thing to freshen the air.'\nHe, too, took his cap.", "'Porfiry  Petrovitch,  please  don't  take  up  the\nnotion  that  I  have  confessed  to  you  to-day,'\nRaskolnikov pronounced with sullen insistence.\n'You're  a  strange  man  and  I  have  listened  to\nyou  from  simple  curiosity.

If  anything  were  to  happen\n(though indeed I don't believe in it and think you\nquite  incapable  of  it),  yet  in  case  you  were\ntaken  during  these  forty  or  fifty  hours  with  the\nnotion of putting an end to the business in some\nother  way,  in  some  fantastic  fashion-laying\nhands  on  yourself-(it's  an  absurd  proposition,\nbut you must forgive me for it) do leave a brief\nbut  precise  note,  only  two  lines,  and  mention\nthe  stone.

The  latter  went  to  the  window\nand waited with (cid:24)(cid:24) irritable  impatience  till  he \ncalculated  that  Porfiry  had reached the street\nand  moved  away.  Then  he  too  went  hurriedly\nout of the room.(cid:24) ", "#$#$Chapter 39#$#$\nHe  hurried  to  Svidrigaïlov's.  What  he  had  to\nhope from \nthat  man  he  did  not  know.  But  that  man  had\nsome  hidden  power  over  him.  Having  once\nrecognised this, he could not rest, and now the\ntime had come.\nOn  the  way,  one  question  particularly  worried\nhim: had Svidrigaïlov been to Porfiry's?\nAs far as he could judge, he would swear to it,\nthat he had not. He pondered again and again,\nwent over Porfiry's visit; no, he hadn't been, of\ncourse he hadn't.\nBut  if  he  had  not  been  yet,  would  he  go?\nMeanwhile,  for  the  present  he  fancied  he\ncouldn't.  Why?  He  could  not  have  explained,\nbut if he could, he would not have wasted much\nthought over it at the moment. It all worried him\nand at the same time he could not attend to it.\nStrange  to  say,  none  would  have  believed  it", "perhaps,  but  he  only  felt  a  faint  vague  anxiety\nabout  his  immediate  future.  Another,  much\nmore  important  anxiety  tormented  him-it\nconcerned himself, but in a different, more vital\nway.  Moreover,  he  was  conscious  of  immense\nmoral  fatigue,  though  his  mind  was  working\nbetter that morning than it had done of late.\nAnd  was  it  worth  while,  after  all  that  had\nhappened,  to  contend  with  these  new  trivial\ndifficulties?  Was  it  worth  while,  for  instance,  to\nmanuvre  that  Svidrigaïlov  should  not  go  to\nPorfiry's? Was it worth while to investigate, to (cid:24)(cid:24)\nascertain  the  facts,  to  waste  time  over  anyone\nlike Svidrigaïlov?\nOh, how sick he was of it all!\nAnd yet he was hastening to Svidrigaïlov; could\nhe  be  expecting  something  new  from  him,\ninformation,  or  means  of  escape?  Men  will\ncatch at straws! Was it destiny or some instinct\nbringing  them  together?  Perhaps  it  was  only\nfatigue, despair; perhaps it was not Svidrigaïlov\nbut  some  other  whom  he  needed,  and\nSvidrigaïlov  had  simply  presented  himself  by\nchance. Sonia? But what should he go to Sonia", "for now? To beg her tears again? He was afraid\nof  Sonia,  too.  Sonia  stood  before  him  as  an\nirrevocable sentence. He must go his own way\nor  hers.  At  that  moment  especially  he  did  not\nfeel  equal  to  seeing  her.  No,  would  it  not  be\nbetter to try Svidrigaïlov? And he could not help\ninwardly  owning  that  he  had  long  felt  that  he\nmust see him for some reason.\nBut  what  could  they  have  in  common?  Their\nvery  evildoing  could  not  be  of  the  same  kind.\nThe  man,  moreover,  was  very  unpleasant,\nevidently  depraved,  undoubtedly  cunning  and\ndeceitful, possibly malignant. Such stories were\ntold  about  him.  It  is  true  he  was  befriending\nKaterina Ivanovna's children, but who could tell\nwith  what  motive  and  what  it  meant?  The  man\nalways had some design, some project.\nThere  was  another  thought  which  had  been\ncontinually hovering of late about Raskolnikov's\nmind, and causing him great uneasiness. It was\nso painful that he made distinct efforts to get rid\nof  it.  He  sometimes  thought  that  Svidrigaïlov\nwas  dogging  his  footsteps.  Svidrigaïlov  had\nfound  out  his  (cid:24)  secret  and  had  had  designs  on\nDounia.  What  if  he  had  them  still?  Wasn't  it", "practically  certain  that  he  had?  And  what  if,\nhaving  learnt  his  secret  and  so  having  gained\npower over him, he were to use it as a weapon\nagainst Dounia?\nThis  idea  sometimes  even  tormented  his\ndreams,  but  it  had  never  presented  itself  so\nvividly to him as on his way to Svidrigaïlov. The\nvery  thought  moved  him  to  gloomy  rage.  To\nbegin  with,  this  would  transform  everything,\neven his own position; he would have at once to\nconfess his secret to Dounia. Would he have to\ngive himself up perhaps to prevent Dounia from\ntaking  some  rash  step?  The  letter?  This\nmorning  Dounia  had  received  a  letter.  From\nwhom  could  she  get  letters  in  Petersburg?\nLuzhin, perhaps? It's true Razumihin was there\nto  protect  her,  but  Razumihin  knew  nothing  of\nthe  position.  Perhaps  it  was  his  duty  to  tell\nRazumihin? He thought of it with repugnance.\nIn  any  case  he  must  see  Svidrigaïlov  as  soon\nas possible, he decided finally. Thank God, the\ndetails  of  the  interview  were  of  little\nconsequence, if only he could get at the root of\nthe matter; but if Svidrigaïlov were capable ... if\nhe were intriguing against Dounia- then ...", "Raskolnikov was so exhausted by what he had\npassed  through  that  month  that  he  could  only\ndecide such questions in one way; 'then I shall\nkill him,' he thought in cold despair.\nA  sudden  anguish  oppressed  his  heart,  he\nstood still in the middle of the street and began\nlooking  about  to  see  where  he  was  and  which\nway  he  was  going.  He  found  himself  in  X.\nProspect,  thirty  or  forty  paces  from  the  Hay\nMarket,  (cid:24)(cid:24)  through  which  he  had  come.  The\nwhole  second  storey  of  the  house  on  the  left\nwas  used  as  a  tavern.  All  the  windows  were\nwide  open;  judging  from  the  figures  moving  at\nthe windows, the rooms were full to overflowing.\nThere were sounds of singing, of clarionet and\nviolin,  and  the  boom  of  a  Turkish  drum.  He\ncould  hear  women  shrieking.  He  was  about  to\nturn back wondering why he had come to the X.\nProspect,  when  suddenly  at  one  of  the  end\nwindows  he  saw  Svidrigaïlov,  sitting  at  a\ntea-table right in the open window with a pipe in\nhis  mouth.  Raskolnikov  was  dreadfully  taken\naback, almost terrified. Svidrigaïlov was silently\nwatching and scrutinising him and, what struck\nRaskolnikov at once, seemed to be meaning to", "get up and slip away unobserved. \nRaskolnikov  at  once  pretended  not  to  have\nseen  him,  but  to  be  looking  absent-mindedly\naway, while he watched him out of the corner of\nhis  eye.  His  heart  was  beating  violently.  Yet,  it\nwas evident that Svidrigaïlov did not want to be\nseen.  He  took  the  pipe  out  of  his  mouth  and\nwas  on  the  point  of  concealing  himself,  but  as\nhe got up and moved back his chair, he seemed\nto  have  become  suddenly  aware  that\nRaskolnikov  had  seen  him,  and  was  watching\nhim. What had passed between them was much\nthe  same  as  what  happened  at  their  first\nmeeting  in  Raskolnikov's  room.  A  sly  smile\ncame into Svidrigaïlov's face and grew broader\nand broader. Each knew that he was seen and\nwatched by the other. At last Svidrigaïlov broke\ninto a loud laugh.\n'Well, well, come in if you want me; I am here!'\nhe shouted from the window.\nRaskolnikov  went  up  into  the  tavern.  He  found\nSvid(cid:24)(cid:24)0 Crime and Punishment rigaïlov in a tiny\nback  room,  adjoining  the  saloon  in  which\nmerchants, clerks and numbers of people of all", "sorts were drinking tea at twenty little tables to\nthe  desperate  bawling  of  a  chorus  of  singers.\nThe  click  of  billiard  balls  could  be  heard  in  the\ndistance. On the table before Svidrigaïlov stood\nan  open  bottle  and  a  glass  half  full  of\nchampagne.  In  the  room  he  found  also  a  boy\nwith  a  little  hand  organ,  a  healthy-looking  red-\ncheeked  girl  of  eighteen,  wearing  a  tucked-up\nstriped skirt, and a Tyrolese hat with ribbons. In\nspite  of  the  chorus  in  the  other  room,  she  was\nsinging  some  servants'  hall  song  in  a  rather\nhusky  contralto,  to  the  accompaniment  of  the\norgan.\n'Come, that's enough,' Svidrigaïlov stopped her\nat  Raskolnikov's  entrance.  The  girl  at  once\nbroke  off  and  stood  waiting  respectfully.  She\nhad  sung  her  guttural  rhymes,  too,  with  a\nserious and respectful expression in her face.\n'Hey, Philip, a glass!' shouted Svidrigaïlov.\n'I won't drink anything,' said Raskolnikov.\n'As  you  like,  I  didn't  mean  it  for  you.  Drink,\nKatia!  I  don't  want  anything  more  to-day,  you\ncan go.' He poured her out a full glass, and laid", "down a yellow note.\nKatia drank off her glass of wine, as women do,\nwithout putting it down, in twenty gulps, took the\nnote  and  kissed  Svidrigaïlov's  hand,  which  he\nallowed  quite  seriously.  She  went  out  of  the\nroom  and  the  boy  trailed  after  her  with  the\norgan.  Both  had  been  brought  in  from  the\nstreet.  Svidrigaïlov  had  not  been  a  week  in\nPetersburg,  but  everything  about  him  was\nalready,  so  to  speak,  on  a  patriarchal  footing;\nthe waiter, Philip, was by now an old friend and\nvery (cid:24)1 obsequious.\nThe door leading to the saloon had a lock on it.\nSvidrigaïlov  was  at  home  in  this  room  and\nperhaps spent whole days in it. The tavern was\ndirty and wretched, not even secondrate.\n'I  was  going  to  see  you  and  looking  for  you,'\nRaskolnikov  began,  'but  I  don't  know  what\nmade me turn from the Hay Market into the X.\nProspect  just  now.  I  never  take  this  turning.  I\nturn  to  the  right  from  the  Hay  Market.  And  this\nisn't  the  way  to  you.  I  simply  turned  and  here\nyou are. It is strange!'", "'Why don't you say at once 'it's a miracle'?'\n'Because it may be only chance.'\n'Oh,  that's  the  way  with  all  you  folk,'  laughed\nSvidrigaïlov. 'You won't admit it, even if you do\ninwardly believe it a miracle! Here you say that\nit may be only chance. And what cowards they\nall  are  here,  about  having  an  opinion  of  their\nown,  you  can't  fancy,  Rodion  Romanovitch.  I\ndon't  mean  you,  you  have  an  opinion  of  your\nown and are not afraid to have it. That's how it\nwas you attracted my curiosity.'\n'Nothing else?'\n'Well,  that's  enough,  you  know,'  Svidrigaïlov\nwas  obviously  exhilarated,  but  only  slightly  so,\nhe had not had more than half a glass of wine.\n'I  fancy  you  came  to  see  me  before  you  knew\nthat  I  was  capable  of  having  what  you  call  an\nopinion of my own,' observed Raskolnikov.\n'Oh, well, it was a different matter. everyone has\nhis  own  plans.  And  apropos  of  the  miracle  let\nme tell you that I (cid:24) think you have been asleep", "for the last two or three days. I told you of this\ntavern  myself,  there  is  no  miracle  in  your\ncoming  straight  here.  I  explained  the  way\nmyself,  told  you  where  it  was,  and  the  hours\nyou could find me here. Do you remember?'\n'I  don't  remember,'  answered  Raskolnikov  with\nsurprise.\n'I believe you. I told you twice. The address has\nbeen  stamped  mechanically  on  your  memory.\nYou  turned  this  way  mechanically  and  yet\nprecisely according to the direction, though you\nare  not  aware  of  it.  When  I  told  you  then,  I\nhardly  hoped  you  understood  me.  You  give\nyourself  away  too  much,  Rodion  Romanovitch.\nAnd another thing, I'm convinced there are lots\nof people in Petersburg who talk to themselves\nas they walk. This is a town of crazy people. If\nonly  we  had  scientific  men,  doctors,  lawyers\nand  philosophers  might  make  most  valuable\ninvestigations  in  Petersburg  each  in  his  own\nline.  There  are  few  places  where  there  are  so\nmany  gloomy,  strong  and  queer  influences  on\nthe  soul  of  man  as  in  Petersburg.  The  mere\ninfluences  of  climate  mean  so  much.  And  it's\nthe  administrative  centre  of  all  Russia  and  its", "character  must  be  reflected  on  the  whole\ncountry. But that is neither here nor there now.\nThe  point  is  that  I  have  several  times  watched\nyou.  You  walk  out  of  your  house-holding  your\nhead  high-twenty  paces  from  home  you  let  it\nsink,  and  fold  your  hands  behind  your  back.\nYou  look  and  evidently  see  nothing  before  nor\nbeside  you.  At  last  you  begin  moving  your  lips\nand  talking  to  yourself,  and  sometimes  you\nwave  one  hand  and  declaim,  and  at  last  stand\nstill  in  the  middle  of  the  road.  That's  not  at  all\nthe  (cid:24)(cid:24)  thing.  Someone  may  be  watching  you\nbesides  me,  and  it  won't  do  you  any  good.  It's\nnothing  really  to  do  with  me  and  I  can't  cure\nyou, but, of course, you understand me.'\n'Do you know that I am being followed?' asked\nRaskolnikov, looking inquisitively at him.\n'No,  I  know  nothing  about  it,'  said  Svidrigaïlov,\nseeming surprised.\n'Well, then, let us leave me alone,' Raskolnikov\nmuttered, frowning.\n'Very good, let us leave you alone.'", "'You  had  better  tell  me,  if  you  come  here  to\ndrink,  and  directed  me  twice  to  come  here  to\nyou, why did you hide, and try to get away just\nnow  when  I  looked  at  the  window  from  the\nstreet? I saw it.'\n'He-he!  And  why  was  it  you  lay  on  your  sofa\nwith  closed  eyes  and  pretended  to  be  asleep,\nthough  you  were  wide  awake  while  I  stood  in\nyour doorway? I saw it.'\n'I  may  have  had  ...  reasons.  You  know  that\nyourself.'\n'And  I  may  have  had  my  reasons,  though  you\ndon't know them.'\nRaskolnikov  dropped  his  right  elbow  on  the\ntable, leaned his chin in the fingers of his right\nhand,  and  stared  intently  at  Svidrigaïlov.  For  a\nfull  minute  he  scrutinised  his  face,  which  had\nimpressed  him  before.  It  was  a  strange  face,\nlike a mask; white and red, with bright red lips,\nwith  a  flaxen  beard,  and  still  thick  flaxen  hair.\nHis  eyes  were  somehow  too  blue  and  their\nexpression  somehow  too  heavy  and  fixed.\nThere was something awfully unpleasant in that", "handsome  face,  which  looked  so  wonderfully\nyoung  for  his  age.  Svid(cid:24)  rigaïlov  was  smartly\ndressed  in  light  summer  clothes  and  was\nparticularly dainty in his linen. He wore a huge\nring with a precious stone in it.\n'Have  I  got  to  bother  myself  about  you,  too,\nnow?'  said  Raskolnikov  suddenly,  coming  with\nnervous  impatience  straight  to  the  point.  'Even\nthough  perhaps  you  are  the  most  dangerous\nman if you care to injure me, I don't want to put\nmyself  out  any  more.  I  will  show  you  at  once\nthat I don't prize myself as you probably think I\ndo. I've come to tell you at once that if you keep\nto  your  former  intentions  with  regard  to  my\nsister  and  if  you  think  to  derive  any  benefit  in\nthat direction from what has been discovered of\nlate, I will kill you before you get me locked up.\nYou  can  reckon  on  my  word.  You  know  that  I\ncan keep it. And in the second place if you want\nto  tell  me  anything  -for  I  keep  fancying  all  this\ntime  that  you  have  something  to  tell  me-make\nhaste  and  tell  it,  for  time  is  precious  and  very\nlikely it will soon be too late.'\n'Why in such haste?' asked Svidrigaïlov, looking\nat him curiously.", "'Everyone has his plans,' Raskolnikov answered\ngloomily and impatiently.\n'You  urged  me  yourself  to  frankness  just  now,\nand at the first question you refuse to answer,'\nSvidrigaïlov  observed  with  a  smile.  'You  keep\nfancying that I have aims of my own and so you\nlook  at  me  with  suspicion.  Of  course  it's\nperfectly  natural  in  your  position.  But  though  I\nshould  like  to  be  friends  with  you,  I  shan't\ntrouble  myself  to  convince  you  of  the  contrary.\nThe game isn't worth the candle and I wasn't (cid:24)(cid:24)\nintending to talk to you about anything special.'\n'What  did  you  want  me,  for,  then?  It  was  you\nwho came hanging about me.'\n'Why,  simply  as  an  interesting  subject  for\nobservation.  I  liked  the  fantastic  nature  of  your\nposition-that's what it was! Besides you are the\nbrother  of  a  person  who  greatly  interested  me,\nand from that person I had in the past heard a\nvery  great  deal  about  you,  from  which  I\ngathered  that  you  had  a  great  influence  over\nher;  isn't  that  enough?  Ha-ha-ha!  Still  I  must\nadmit that your question is rather complex, and", "is  difficult  for  me  to  answer.  Here,  you,  for\ninstance,  have  come  to  me  not  only  for  a\ndefinite  object,  but  for  the  sake  of  hearing\nsomething  new.  Isn't  that  so?  Isn't  that  so?'\npersisted  Svidrigaïlov  with  a  sly  smile.  'Well,\ncan't you fancy then that I, too, on my way here\nin  the  train  was  reckoning  on  you,  on  your\ntelling  me  something  new,  and  on  my  making\nsome profit out of you! You see what rich men\nwe are!'\n'What profit could you make?'\n'How can I tell you? How do I know? You see in\nwhat  a  tavern  I  spend  all  my  time  and  it's  my\nenjoyment, that's to say it's no great enjoyment,\nbut  one  must  sit  somewhere;  that  poor  Katia\nnow-you saw her? ... If only I had been a glutton\nnow,  a  club  gourmand,  but  you  see  I  can  eat\nthis.'\nHe  pointed  to  a  little  table  in  the  corner  where\nthe  remnants  of  a  terrible-looking  beef-steak\nand potatoes lay on a tin dish.\n'Have  you  dined,  by  the  way?  I've  had\nsomething and want nothing more. I don't drink,", "for  instance,  at  all.  Except  for  champagne  I\nnever  touch  anything,  and  not  more  (cid:24)  than  a\nglass  of  that  all  the  evening,  and  even  that  is\nenough to make my head ache. I ordered it just\nnow  to  wind  myself  up,  for  I  am  just  going  off\nsomewhere and you see me in a peculiar state\nof mind. That was why I hid myself just now like\na  schoolboy,  for  I  was  afraid  you  would  hinder\nme. But I believe,' he pulled out his watch, 'I can\nspend an hour with you. It's half-past four now.\nIf  only  I'd  been  something,  a  landowner,  a\nfather,  a  cavalry  officer,  a  photographer,  a\njournalist  ...

I  really\nthought you would tell me something new.'\n'But  what  are  you,  and  why  have  you  come\nhere?'\n'What  am  I?  You  know,  a  gentleman,  I  served\nfor  two  years  in  the  cavalry,  then  I  knocked\nabout here in Petersburg, then I married Marfa\nPetrovna  and  lived  in  the  country.

Why?'\n'Why,  you  might  have  challenged  them  ...\naltogether it must have been lively.'\n'I  won't  contradict  you,  and  besides  I  am  no\nhand  at  philosophy.  I  confess  that  I  hastened\nhere for the sake of the women.'\n'As  soon  as  you  buried  Marfa  Petrovna?'(cid:24)(cid:24)\n'Quite  so,'  Svidrigaïlov  smiled  with  engaging\ncandour.  'What  of  it?  You  seem  to  find\nsomething wrong in my speaking like that about\nwomen?'\n'You ask whether I find anything wrong in vice?'\n'Vice!  Oh,  that's  what  you  are  after!  But  I'll", "answer  you  in  order,  first  about  women  in\ngeneral; you know I am fond of talking. Tell me,\nwhat should I restrain myself for? Why should I\ngive  up  women,  since  I  have  a  passion  for\nthem? It's an occupation, anyway.'\n'So you hope for nothing here but vice?'\n'Oh,  very  well,  for  vice  then.  You  insist  on  its\nbeing vice. But anyway I like a direct question.\nIn  this  vice  at  least  there  is  something\npermanent,  founded  indeed  upon  nature  and\nnot dependent on fantasy, something present in\nthe  blood  like  an  ever-burning  ember,  for  ever\nsetting one on fire and, maybe, not to be quickly\nextinguished,  even  with  years.  You'll  agree  it's\nan occupation of a sort.'\n'That's nothing to rejoice at, it's a disease and a\ndangerous one.'\n'Oh, that's what you think, is it! I agree, that it is\na  disease  like  everything  that  exceeds\nmoderation.  And,  of  course,  in  this  one  must\nexceed  moderation.  But  in  the  first  place,\neverybody does so in one way or another, and\nin the second place, of course, one ought to be", "moderate  and  prudent,  however  mean  it  may\nbe, but what am I to do? If I hadn't this, I might\nhave to shoot myself. I am ready to admit that a\ndecent  man  ought  to  put  up  with  being  bored,\nbut yet ...'\n'And could you shoot yourself?'\n'Oh,  come!'  Svidrigaïlov  parried  with  disgust.\n'Please  (cid:24)  don't  speak  of  it,'  he  added  hurriedly\nand  with  none  of  the  bragging  tone  he  had\nshown in all the previous conversation. His face\nquite  changed.  'I  admit  it's  an  unpardonable\nweakness,  but  I  can't  help  it.  I  am  afraid  of\ndeath  and  I  dislike  its  being  talked  of.  Do  you\nknow that I am to a certain extent a mystic?'\n'Ah, the apparitions of Marfa Petrovna! Do they\nstill go on visiting you?'\n'Oh,  don't  talk  of  them;  there  have  been  no\nmore  in  Petersburg,  confound  them!'  he  cried\nwith an air of irritation. 'Let's rather talk of that ...\nthough ... H'm! I have not much time, and can't\nstay  long  with  you,  it's  a  pity!  I  should  have\nfound plenty to tell you.'", "'What's your engagement, a woman?'\n'Yes,  a  woman,  a  casual  incident....  No,  that's\nnot what I want to talk of.'\n'And  the  hideousness,  the  filthiness  of  all  your\nsurroundings, doesn't that affect you? Have you\nlost the strength to stop yourself?'\n'And do you pretend to strength, too? He-he-he!\nYou  surprised  me  just  now,  Rodion\nRomanovitch,  though  I  knew  beforehand  it\nwould be so. You preach to me about vice and\næsthetics!  You-a  Schiller,  you-an  idealist!  Of\ncourse that's all as it should be and it would be\nsurprising  if  it  were  not  so,  yet  it  is  strange  in\nreality....  Ah,  what  a  pity  I  have  no  time,  for\nyou're a most interesting type! And, by-the-way,\nare  you  fond  of  Schiller?  I  am  awfully  fond  of\nhim.'\n'But what a braggart you are,' Raskolnikov said\nwith  some  disgust.(cid:24)(cid:24)  'Upon  my  word,  I  am  not,'\nanswered  Svidrigaïlov  laughing.  'However,  I\nwon't  dispute  it,  let  me  be  a  braggart,  why  not\nbrag, if it hurts no one? I spent seven years in\nthe country with Marfa Petrovna, so now when I", "come  across  an  intelligent  person  like\nyou-intelligent and highly interesting-I am simply\nglad  to  talk  and,  besides,  I've  drunk  that\nhalf-glass  of  champagne  and  it's  gone  to  my\nhead a little. And besides, there's a certain fact\nthat has wound me up tremendously, but about\nthat I ... will keep quiet. Where are you off to?'\nhe asked in alarm.\nRaskolnikov  had  begun  getting  up.  He  felt\noppressed and stifled and, as it were, ill at ease\nat  having  come  here.  He  felt  convinced  that\nSvidrigaïlov  was  the  most  worthless  scoundrel\non the face of the earth.\n'A-ach!  Sit  down,  stay  a  little!'  Svidrigaïlov\nbegged. 'Let them bring you some tea, anyway.\nStay a little, I won't talk nonsense, about myself,\nI mean. I'll tell you something. If you like I'll tell\nyou  how  a  woman  tried  'to  save'  me,  as  you\nwould  call  it?  It  will  be  an  answer  to  your  first\nquestion indeed, for the woman was your sister.\nMay I tell you? It will help to spend the time.'\n'Tell me, but I trust that you ...'\n'Oh,  don't  be  uneasy.  Besides,  even  in  a", "worthless  low  fellow  like  me,  Avdotya\nRomanovna  can  only  excite  the  deepest\nrespect.'(cid:24)(cid:24)0 Crime and Punishment ", "#$#$Chapter 40#$#$\n'You  know  perhaps-yes,  I  told  you  myself,'\nbegan  Svidrigaïlov,  'that  I  was  in  the  debtors'\nprison here, for an immense sum, and had not\nany expectation of being able to pay it. There's\nno  need  to  go  into  particulars  how  Marfa\nPetrovna bought me out; do you know to what a\npoint of insanity a woman can sometimes love?\nShe was an honest woman, and very sensible,\nalthough  completely  uneducated.  Would  you\nbelieve  that  this  honest  and  jealous  woman,\nafter many scenes of hysterics and reproaches,\ncondescended  to  enter  into  a  kind  of  contract\nwith me which she kept throughout our married\nlife?  She  was  considerably  older  than  I,  and\nbesides, she always kept a clove or something\nin her mouth. There was so much swinishness\nin my soul and honesty too, of a sort, as to tell\nher  straight  out  that  I  couldn't  be  absolutely\nfaithful  to  her.  This  confession  drove  her  to\nfrenzy, but yet she seems in a way to have liked\nmy  brutal  frankness.  She  thought  it  showed  I\nwas unwilling to deceive her if I warned her like\nthis  beforehand  and  for  a  jealous  woman,  you", "know,  that's  the  first  consideration.  After  many\ntears  an  unwritten  contract  was  drawn  up\nbetween us: first, that I would never leave Marfa\nPetrovna  and  would  always  be  her  husband;\nsecondly,  that  I  would  never  absent  myself\nwithout  her  permission;  thirdly,  that  I  would\nnever set up a permanent mistress; fourthly, in\nreturn  for  (cid:24)1  this,  Marfa  Petrovna  gave  me  a\nfree  hand  with  the  maidservants,  but  only  with\nher  secret  knowledge;  fifthly,  God  forbid  my\nfalling in love with a woman of our class; sixthly,\nin case I-which God forbid-should be visited by\na great serious passion I was bound to reveal it\nto Marfa Petrovna. On this last score, however,\nMarfa  Petrovna  was  fairly  at  ease.  She  was  a\nsensible  woman  and  so  she  could  not  help\nlooking  upon  me  as  a  dissolute  profligate\nincapable  of  real  love.  But  a  sensible  woman\nand  a  jealous  woman  are  two  very  different\nthings,  and  that's  where  the  trouble  came  in.\nBut  to  judge  some  people  impartially  we  must\nrenounce  certain  preconceived  opinions  and\nour  habitual  attitude  to  the  ordinary  people\nabout  us.  I  have  reason  to  have  faith  in  your\njudgment rather than in anyone's. Perhaps you\nhave  already  heard  a  great  deal  that  was\nridiculous  and  absurd  about  Marfa  Petrovna.", "She  certainly  had  some  very  ridiculous  ways,\nbut I tell you frankly that I feel really sorry for the\ninnumerable  woes  of  which  I  was  the  cause.\nWell,  and  that's  enough,  I  think,  by  way  of  a\ndecorous  oraison  funèbre  for  the  most  tender\nwife  of  a  most  tender  husband.  When  we\nquarrelled, I usually held my tongue and did not\nirritate her and that gentlemanly conduct rarely\nfailed  to  attain  its  object,  it  influenced  her,  it\npleased  her,  indeed.  These  were  times  when\nshe was positively proud of me. But your sister\nshe couldn't put up with, anyway. And however\nshe  came  to  risk  taking  such  a  beautiful\ncreature  into  her  house  as  a  governess.  My\nexplanation  is  that  Marfa  Petrovna  was  an\nardent  and  impressionable  woman  and  simply\nfell  in  love  herself-literally  fell  in  love-with  your\nsister.  Well,  little  (cid:24)  wonder-look  at  Avdotya\nRomanovna! I saw the danger at the first glance\nand what do you think, I resolved not to look at\nher  even.  But  Avdotya  Romanovna  herself\nmade the first step, would you believe it? Would\nyou  believe  it  too  that  Marfa  Petrovna  was\npositively angry with me at first for my persistent\nsilence  about  your  sister,  for  my  careless\nreception  of  her  continual  adoring  praises  of\nAvdotya  Romanovna.  I  don't  know  what  it  was", "she  wanted!  Well,  of  course,  Marfa  Petrovna\ntold Avdotya Romanovna every detail about me.\nShe had the unfortunate habit of telling literally\neveryone  all  our  family  secrets  and  continually\ncomplaining of me; how could she fail to confide\nin  such  a  delightful  new  friend?  I  expect  they\ntalked  of  nothing  else  but  me  and  no  doubt\nAvdotya  Romanovna  heard  all  those  dark\nmysterious  rumours  that  were  current  about\nme....  I  don't  mind  betting  that  you  too  have\nheard something of the sort already?'\n'I have. Luzhin charged you with having caused\nthe death of a child. Is that true?'\n'Don't  refer  to  those  vulgar  tales,  I  beg,'  said\nSvidrigaïlov with disgust and annoyance. 'If you\ninsist on wanting to know about all that idiocy, I\nwill tell you one day, but now ...'\n'I was told too about some footman of yours in\nthe country whom you treated badly.'\n'I  beg  you  to  drop  the  subject,'  Svidrigaïlov\ninterrupted again with obvious impatience.\n'Was  that  the  footman  who  came  to  you  after", "death  to  fill  your  pipe?  ...  you  told  me  about  it\nyourself.'  Raskolnikov  felt  more  and  more\nirritated.(cid:24)(cid:24)  Svidrigaïlov  looked  at  him  attentively\nand  Raskolnikov  fancied  he  caught  a  flash  of\nspiteful  mockery  in  that  look.  But  Svidrigaïlov\nrestrained himself and answered very civilly:\n'Yes,  it  was.  I  see  that  you,  too,  are  extremely\ninterested  and  shall  feel  it  my  duty  to  satisfy\nyour  curiosity  at  the  first  opportunity.  Upon  my\nsoul! I see that I really might pass for a romantic\nfigure  with  some  people.  Judge  how  grateful  I\nmust be to Marfa Petrovna for having repeated\nto  Avdotya  Romanovna  such  mysterious  and\ninteresting  gossip  about  me.  I  dare  not  guess\nwhat impression it made on her, but in any case\nit  worked  in  my  interests.  With  all  Avdotya\nRomanovna's  natural  aversion  and  in  spite  of\nmy  invariably  gloomy  and  repellent  aspect-she\ndid at least feel pity for me, pity for a lost soul.\nAnd  if  once  a  girl's  heart  is  moved  to  pity  it's\nmore dangerous than anything. She is bound to\nwant  to  'save  him,'  to  bring  him  to  his  senses,\nand lift him up and draw him to nobler aims, and\nrestore him to new life and usefulness-well, we\nall know how far such dreams can go. I saw at\nonce  that  the  bird  was  flying  into  the  cage  of", "herself.  And  I  too  made  ready.  I  think  you  are\nfrowning,  Rodion  Romanovitch?  There's  no\nneed.  As  you  know,  it  all  ended  in  smoke.\n(Hang  it  all,  what  a  lot  I  am  drinking!)  Do  you\nknow,  I  always,  from  the  very  beginning,\nregretted  that  it  wasn't  your  sister's  fate  to  be\nborn in the second or third century A.D., as the\ndaughter of a reigning prince or some governor\nor  pro-consul  in  Asia  Minor.  She  would\nundoubtedly have been one of those who would\nendure martyrdom and would have smiled when\nthey branded her bosom with (cid:24) hot pincers. And\nshe would have gone to it of herself. And in the\nfourth  or  fifth  century  she  would  have  walked\naway  into  the  Egyptian  desert  and  would  have\nstayed  there  thirty  years  living  on  roots  and\necstasies and visions. She is simply thirsting to\nface some torture for someone, and if she can't\nget  her  torture,  she'll  throw  herself  out  of  a\nwindow.  I've  heard  something  of  a  Mr.\nRazumihin-he's said to be a sensible fellow; his\nsurname  suggests  it,  indeed.  He's  probably  a\ndivinity student. Well, he'd better look after your\nsister!  I  believe  I  understand  her,  and  I  am\nproud  of  it.  But  at  the  beginning  of  an\nacquaintance,  as  you  know,  one  is  apt  to  be\nmore  heedless  and  stupid.  One  doesn't  see", "clearly.  Hang  it  all,  why  is  she  so  handsome?\nIt's not my fault. In fact, it began on my side with\na  most  irresistible  physical  desire.  Avdotya\nRomanovna  is  awfully  chaste,  incredibly  and\nphenomenally  so.  Take  note,  I  tell  you  this\nabout  your  sister  as  a  fact.  She  is  almost\nmorbidly  chaste,  in  spite  of  her  broad\nintelligence, and it will stand in her way. There\nhappened  to  be  a  girl  in  the  house  then,\nParasha,  a  black-eyed  wench,  whom  I  had\nnever  seen  before-she  had  just  come  from\nanother village-very pretty, but incredibly stupid:\nshe burst into tears, wailed so that she could be\nheard  all  over  the  place  and  caused  scandal.\nOne  day  after  dinner  Avdotya  Romanovna\nfollowed  me  into  an  avenue  in  the  garden  and\nwith  flashing  eyes  insisted  on  my  leaving  poor\nParasha  alone.  It  was  almost  our  first\nconversation  by  ourselves.  I,  of  course,  was\nonly  too  pleased  to  obey  her  wishes,  tried  to\nappear  disconcerted,  embarrassed,  in  fact\nplayed  my  part  not  badly.  Then  came\ninterviews,  mysterious  conversations,  (cid:24)(cid:24)\nexhortations,  entreaties,  supplications,  even\ntears-would  you  believe  it,  even  tears?  Think\nwhat  the  passion  for  propaganda  will  bring\nsome  girls  to!  I,  of  course,  threw  it  all  on  my", "destiny,  posed  as  hungering  and  thirsting  for\nlight,  and  finally  resorted  to  the  most  powerful\nweapon in the subjection of the female heart, a\nweapon  which  never  fails  one.  It's  the\nwell-known  resource-flattery.  Nothing  in  the\nworld  is  harder  than  speaking  the  truth  and\nnothing  easier  than  flattery.  If  there's  the\nhundredth  part  of  a  false  note  in  speaking  the\ntruth,  it  leads  to  a  discord,  and  that  leads  to\ntrouble.  But  if  all,  to  the  last  note,  is  false  in\nflattery, it is just as agreeable, and is heard not\nwithout  satisfaction.  It  may  be  a  coarse\nsatisfaction, but still a satisfaction. And however\ncoarse  the  flattery,  at  least  half  will  be  sure  to\nseem  true.  That's  so  for  all  stages  of\ndevelopment  and  classes  of  society.  A  vestal\nvirgin might be seduced by flattery. I can never\nremember without laughter how I once seduced\na  lady  who  was  devoted  to  her  husband,  her\nchildren, and her principles. What fun it was and\nhow  little  trouble!  And  the  lady  really  had\nprinciples-of her own, anyway. All my tactics lay\nin simply being utterly annihilated and prostrate\nbefore  her  purity.  I  flattered  her  shamelessly,\nand  as  soon  as  I  succeeded  in  getting  a\npressure of the hand, even a glance from her, I\nwould reproach myself for having snatched it by", "force, and would declare that she had resisted,\nso that I could never have gained anything but\nfor  my  being  so  unprincipled.  I  maintained  that\nshe was so innocent that she could not foresee\nmy treachery, and yielded to me unconsciously,\nunawares, and so on. In fact, I triumphed, while\nmy  lady  remained  (cid:24)  firmly  convinced  that  she\nwas  innocent,  chaste,  and  faithful  to  all  her\nduties  and  obligations  and  had  succumbed\nquite by accident. And how angry she was with\nme  when  I  explained  to  her  at  last  that  it  was\nmy  sincere  conviction  that  she  was  just  as\neager  as  I.  Poor  Marfa  Petrovna  was  awfully\nweak  on  the  side  of  flattery,  and  if  I  had  only\ncared  to,  I  might  have  had  all  her  property\nsettled on me during her lifetime. (I am drinking\nan awful lot of wine now and talking too much.) I\nhope you won't be angry if I mention now that I\nwas  beginning  to  produce  the  same  effect  on\nAvdotya  Romanovna.  But  I  was  stupid  and\nimpatient  and  spoiled  it  all.  Avdotya\nRomanovna had several times-and one time in\nparticular-been  greatly  displeased  by  the\nexpression  of  my  eyes,  would  you  believe  it?\nThere  was  sometimes  a  light  in  them  which\nfrightened  her  and  grew  stronger  and  stronger\nand more unguarded till it was hateful to her. No", "need  to  go  into  detail,  but  we  parted.  There  I\nacted  stupidly  again.  I  fell  to  jeering  in  the\ncoarsest way at all such propaganda and efforts\nto  convert  me;  Parasha  came  on  to  the  scene\nagain,  and  not  she  alone;  in  fact  there  was  a\ntremendous  to-do.  Ah,  Rodion  Romanovitch,  if\nyou  could  only  see  how  your  sister's  eyes  can\nflash sometimes! Never mind my being drunk at\nthis  moment  and  having  had  a  whole  glass  of\nwine. I am speaking the truth. I assure you that\nthis  glance  has  haunted  my  dreams;  the  very\nrustle of her dress was more than I could stand\nat  last.  I  really  began  to  think  that  I  might\nbecome  epileptic.  I  could  never  have  believed\nthat  I  could  be  moved  to  such  a  frenzy.  It  was\nessential, indeed, to be reconciled, but by then\nit  was  impossible.  And  imagine  (cid:24)(cid:24)  what  I  did\nthen! To what a pitch of stupidity a man can be\nbrought by frenzy! Never undertake anything in\na  frenzy,  Rodion  Romanovitch.  I  reflected  that\nAvdotya  Romanovna  was  after  all  a  beggar\n(ach, excuse me, that's not the word ... but does\nit matter if it expresses the meaning?), that she\nlived by her work, that she had her mother and\nyou  to  keep  (ach,  hang  it,  you  are  frowning\nagain),  and  I  resolved  to  offer  her  all  my\nmoney-thirty  thousand  roubles  I  could  have", "realised  then-if  she  would  run  away  with  me\nhere,  to  Petersburg.  Of  course  I  should  have\nvowed eternal love, rapture, and so on. Do you\nknow, I was so wild about her at that time that if\nshe had told me to poison Marfa Petrovna or to\ncut  her  throat  and  to  marry  herself,  it  would\nhave  been  done  at  once!  But  it  ended  in  the\ncatastrophe  of  which  you  know  already.  You\ncan  fancy  how  frantic  I  was  when  I  heard  that\nMarfa Petrovna had got hold of that scoundrelly\nattorney, Luzhin, and had almost made a match\nbetween  them-which  would  really  have  been\njust  the  same  thing  as  I  was  proposing.\nWouldn't  it?  Wouldn't  it?  I  notice  that  you've\nbegun  to  be  very  attentive  ...  you  interesting\nyoung man....'\nSvidrigaïlov  struck  the  table  with  his  fist\nimpatiently.  He  was  flushed.  Raskolnikov  saw\nclearly  that  the  glass  or  glass  and  a  half  of\nchampagne  that  he  had  sipped  almost\nunconsciously  was  affecting  him-  and  he\nresolved  to  take  advantage  of  the  opportunity.\nHe felt very suspicious of \nSvidrigaïlov.", "'Well,  after  what  you  have  said,  I  am  fully\nconvinced  that  you  have  come  to  Petersburg\nwith designs on my sister,' he (cid:24) said directly to\nSvidrigaïlov, in order to irritate him further.\n'Oh,  nonsense,'  said  Svidrigaïlov,  seeming  to\nrouse himself. 'Why, I told you ... besides your\nsister can't endure me.'\n'Yes,  I  am  certain  that  she  can't,  but  that's  not\nthe point.'\n'Are  you  so  sure  that  she  can't?'  Svidrigaïlov\nscrewed  up  his  eyes  and  smiled  mockingly.\n'You are right, she doesn't love me, but you can\nnever  be  sure  of  what  has  passed  between\nhusband and wife or lover and mistress. There's\nalways a little corner which remains a secret to\nthe  world  and  is  only  known  to  those  two.  Will\nyou  answer  for  it  that  Avdotya  Romanovna\nregarded me with aversion?'\n'From some words you've dropped, I notice that\nyou  still  have  designs  -and  of  course  evil\nones-on  Dounia  and  mean  to  carry  them  out\npromptly.'", "'What,  have  I  dropped  words  like  that?'\nSvidrigaïlov  asked  in  naïve  dismay,  taking  not\nthe  slightest  notice  of  the  epithet  bestowed  on\nhis designs.\n'Why,  you  are  dropping  them  even  now.  Why\nare  you  so  frightened?  What  are  you  so  afraid\nof now?'\n'Me-afraid? Afraid of you? You have rather to be\nafraid  of  me,  cher  ami.  But  what  nonsense....\nI've  drunk  too  much  though,  I  see  that.  I  was\nalmost saying too much again. Damn the wine!\nHi! there, water!'\nHe snatched up the champagne bottle and flung\nit  without  ceremony  out  of  the  window.  Philip\nbrought the water.\n'That's  all  nonsense!'  said  Svidrigaïlov,  wetting\na  towel  and  putting  it  to  his  head.  'But  I  can\nanswer  you  in  one  (cid:24)(cid:24)  word  and  annihilate  all\nyour suspicions. Do you know that I am going to\nget married?'\n'You told me so before.'", "'Did  I?  I've  forgotten.  But  I  couldn't  have  told\nyou  so  for  certain  for  I  had  not  even  seen  my\nbetrothed; I only meant to. But now I really have\na  betrothed  and  it's  a  settled  thing,  and  if  it\nweren't  that  I  have  business  that  can't  be  put\noff, I would have taken you to see them at once,\nfor I should like to ask your advice. Ach, hang it,\nonly  ten  minutes  left!  See,  look  at  the  watch.\nBut  I  must  tell  you,  for  it's  an  interesting  story,\nmy marriage, in its own way. Where are you off\nto? Going again?'\n'No, I'm not going away now.'\n'Not at all? We shall see. I'll take you there, I'll\nshow you my betrothed, only not now. For you'll\nsoon have to be off. You have to go to the right\nand  I  to  the  left.  Do  you  know  that  Madame\nResslich,  the  woman  I  am  lodging  with  now,\neh? I know what you're thinking, that she's the\nwoman  whose  girl  they  say  drowned  herself  in\nthe  winter.  Come,  are  you  listening?  She\narranged  it  all  for  me.  You're  bored,  she  said,\nyou want something to fill up your time. For, you\nknow,  I  am  a  gloomy,  depressed  person.  Do\nyou think I'm light-hearted? No, I'm gloomy. I do\nno harm, but sit in a corner without speaking a", "word for three days at a time. And that Resslich\nis  a  sly  hussy,  I  tell  you.  I  know  what  she  has\ngot in her mind; she thinks I shall get sick of it,\nabandon my wife and depart, and she'll get hold\nof her and make a profit out of her-in our class,\nof course, or higher. She told me the father was\na  broken-down  retired  official,  who  has  been\nsitting  in  a  chair  (cid:24)(cid:24)0  Crime  and  Punishment  for\nthe last three years with his legs paralysed. The\nmamma,  she  said,  was  a  sensible  woman.\nThere is a son serving in the provinces, but he\ndoesn't  help;  there  is  a  daughter,  who  is\nmarried, but she doesn't visit them. And they've\ntwo  little  nephews  on  their  hands,  as  though\ntheir own children were not enough, and they've\ntaken  from  school  their  youngest  daughter,  a\ngirl  who'll  be  sixteen  in  another  month,  so  that\nthen she can be married. She was for me. We\nwent there. How funny it was! I present myself-a\nlandowner,  a  widower,  of  a  well-  known  name,\nwith  connections,  with  a  fortune.  What  if  I  am\nfifty and she is not sixteen? Who thinks of that?\nBut  it's  fascinating,  isn't  it?  It  is  fascinating,\nha-ha!  You  should  have  seen  how  I  talked  to\nthe  papa  and  mamma.  It  was  worth  paying  to\nhave  seen  me  at  that  moment.  She  comes  in,\ncurtseys, you can fancy, still in a short frock-an", "unopened  bud!  Flushing  like  a  sunset-she  had\nbeen told, no doubt. I don't know how you feel\nabout  female  faces,  but  to  my  mind  these\nsixteen years, these childish eyes, shyness and\ntears of bashfulness are better than beauty; and\nshe  is  a  perfect  little  picture,  too.  Fair  hair  in\nlittle  curls,  like  a  lamb's,  full  little  rosy  lips,  tiny\nfeet, a charmer! ... Well, we made friends. I told\nthem  I  was  in  a  hurry  owing  to  domestic\ncircumstances, and the next day, that is the day\nbefore  yesterday,  we  were  betrothed.  When  I\ngo now I take her on my knee at once and keep\nher there.... Well, she flushes like a sunset and I\nkiss  her  every  minute.  Her  mamma  of  course\nimpresses  on  her  that  this  is  her  husband  and\nthat  this  must  be  so.  It's  simply  delicious!  The\npresent  betrothed  condition  is  perhaps  better\nthan marriage. Here you have (cid:24)1 what is called\nla  nature  et  la  vérité  ha-ha!  I've  talked  to  her\ntwice,  she  is  far  from  a  fool.  Sometimes  she\nsteals a look at me that positively scorches me.\nHer face is like Raphael's Madonna. You know,\nthe  Sistine  Madonna's  face  has  something\nfantastic  in  it,  the  face  of  mournful  religious\necstasy.  Haven't  you  noticed  it?  Well,  she's\nsomething in that line. The day after we'd been\nbetrothed, I bought her presents to the value of", "fifteen  hundred  roubles-a  set  of  diamonds  and\nanother of pearls and a silver dressing-case as\nlarge as this, with all sorts of things in it, so that\neven  my  Madonna's  face  glowed.  I  sat  her  on\nmy  knee,  yesterday,  and  I  suppose  rather  too\nunceremoniously-she  flushed  crimson  and  the\ntears started, but she didn't want to show it. We\nwere  left  alone,  she  suddenly  flung  herself  on\nmy  neck  (for  the  first  time  of  her  own  accord),\nput  her  little  arms  round  me,  kissed  me,  and\nvowed  that  she  would  be  an  obedient,  faithful,\nand  good  wife,  would  make  me  happy,  would\ndevote  all  her  life,  every  minute  of  her  life,\nwould sacrifice everything, everything, and that\nall she asks in return is my respect and that she\nwants  'nothing,  nothing  more  from  me,  no\npresents.'  You'll  admit  that  to  hear  such  a\nconfession, alone, from an angel of sixteen in a\nmuslin  frock,  with  little  curls,  with  a  flush  of\nmaiden  shyness  in  her  cheeks  and  tears  of\nenthusiasm  in  her  eyes  is  rather  fascinating!\nIsn't it fascinating? It's worth paying for, isn't it?\nWell ... listen, we'll go to see my betrothed, only\nnot just now!'\n'The fact is this monstrous difference in age and\ndevelopment  excites  your  sensuality!  Will  you", "really make such a marriage?'(cid:24) 'Why, of course.\nEveryone  thinks  of  himself,  and  he  lives  most\ngaily  who  knows  best  how  to  deceive  himself.\nHa-ha!  But  why  are  you  so  keen  about  virtue?\nHave  mercy  on  me,  my  good  friend.  I  am  a\nsinful man. Ha- ha-ha!'\n'But  you  have  provided  for  the  children  of\nKaterina  Ivanovna.  Though  ...  though  you  had\nyour own reasons.... I understand it all now.'\n'I  am  always  fond  of  children,  very  fond  of\nthem,'  laughed  Svidrigaïlov.  'I  can  tell  you  one\ncurious instance of it. The first day I came here I\nvisited  various  haunts,  after  seven  years  I\nsimply rushed at them. You probably notice that\nI am not in a hurry to renew acquaintance with\nmy  old  friends.  I  shall  do  without  them  as  long\nas I can. Do you know, when I was with Marfa\nPetrovna  in  the  country,  I  was  haunted  by  the\nthought  of  these  places  where  anyone  who\nknows his way about can find a great deal. Yes,\nupon  my  soul!  The  peasants  have  vodka,  the\neducated  young  people,  shut  out  from  activity,\nwaste  themselves  in  impossible  dreams  and\nvisions and are crippled by theories; Jews have\nsprung up and are amassing money, and all the", "rest  give  themselves  up  to  debauchery.  From\nthe  first  hour  the  town  reeked  of  its  familiar\nodours.  I  chanced  to  be  in  a  frightful  den-I  like\nmy  dens  dirty-it  was  a  dance,  so  called,  and\nthere was a cancan such as I never saw in my\nday.  Yes,  there  you  have  progress.  All  of  a\nsudden  I  saw  a  little  girl  of  thirteen,  nicely\ndressed,  dancing  with  a  specialist  in  that  line,\nwith  another  one  visà-vis.  Her  mother  was\nsitting  on  a  chair  by  the  wall.  You  can't  fancy\nwhat a cancan that was! The girl was ashamed,\nblushed,  at  last  felt  insulted,  and  began  to  cry.\nHer partner (cid:24)(cid:24) seized her and began whirling her\nround  and  performing  before  her;  everyone\nlaughed and-I like your public, even the cancan\npublic-they  laughed  and  shouted,  'Serves  her\nright- serves her right! Shouldn't bring children!'\nWell,  it's  not  my  business  whether  that\nconsoling reflection was logical or not. I at once\nfixed on my plan, sat down by the mother, and\nbegan  by  saying  that  I  too  was  a  stranger  and\nthat  people  here  were  ill-bred  and  that  they\ncouldn't distinguish decent folks and treat them\nwith respect, gave her to understand that I had\nplenty  of  money,  offered  to  take  them  home  in\nmy carriage. I took them home and got to know\nthem.  They  were  lodging  in  a  miserable  little", "hole and had only just arrived from the country.\nShe  told  me  that  she  and  her  daughter  could\nonly  regard  my  acquaintance  as  an  honour.  I\nfound out that they had nothing of their own and\nhad come to town upon some legal business. I\nproffered  my  services  and  money.  I  learnt  that\nthey  had  gone  to  the  dancing  saloon  by\nmistake, believing that it was a genuine dancing\nclass.  I  offered  to  assist  in  the  young  girl's\neducation in French and dancing. My offer was\naccepted with enthusiasm as an honour-and we\nare  still  friendly....  If  you  like,  we'll  go  and  see\nthem, only not just now.'\n'Stop!  Enough  of  your  vile,  nasty  anecdotes,\ndepraved vile, sensual man!'\n'Schiller,  you  are  a  regular  Schiller!  O  la  vertu\nva-t-elle se nicher? But you know I shall tell you\nthese  things  on  purpose,  for  the  pleasure  of\nhearing your outcries!'\n'I  dare  say.  I  can  see  I  am  ridiculous  myself,'\nmuttered  Raskolnikov  angrily.(cid:24)  Svidrigaïlov\nlaughed heartily; finally he called Philip, paid his\nbill, and began getting up.", "'I  say,  but  I  am  drunk,  assez  causé  '  he  said.\n'It's been a pleasure.'\n'I  should  rather  think  it  must  be  a  pleasure!'\ncried  Raskolnikov,  getting  up.  'No  doubt  it  is  a\npleasure  for  a  worn-out  profligate  to  describe\nsuch adventures with a monstrous project of the\nsame  sort  in  his  mind-especially  under  such\ncircumstances and to such a man as me.... It's\nstimulating!'\n'Well,  if  you  come  to  that,'  Svidrigaïlov\nanswered,  scrutinising  Raskolnikov  with  some\nsurprise,  'if  you  come  to  that,  you  are  a\nthorough cynic yourself. You've plenty to make\nyou  so,  anyway.  You  can  understand  a  great\ndeal  ...  and  you  can  do  a  great  deal  too.  But\nenough. I sincerely regret not having had more\ntalk  with  you,  but  I  shan't  lose  sight  of  you....\nOnly wait a bit.'\nSvidrigaïlov  walked  out  of  the  restaurant.\nRaskolnikov  walked  out  after  him.  Svidrigaïlov\nwas  not  however  very  drunk,  the  wine  had\naffected  him  for  a  moment,  but  it  was  passing\noff  every  minute.  He  was  preoccupied  with\nsomething of importance and was frowning. He", "was  apparently  excited  and  uneasy  in\nanticipation  of  something.  His  manner  to\nRaskolnikov  had  changed  during  the  last  few\nminutes,  and  he  was  ruder  and  more  sneering\nevery moment. Raskolnikov noticed all this, and\nhe too was uneasy. He became very suspicious\nof Svidrigaïlov and resolved to follow him.\nThey came out on to the pavement.\n'You  go  to  the  right,  and  I  to  the  left,  or  if  you\nlike, the other way. Only adieu, mon plaisir may\nwe  meet  again.'(cid:24)(cid:24)  And  he  walked  to  the  right\ntowards the Hay Market.(cid:24) ", "#$#$Chapter 41#$#$\nRaskolnikov walked after him.\n'What's this?' cried Svidrigaïlov turning round, 'I\nthought I said ...'\n'It means that I am not going to lose sight of you\nnow.'\n'What?'\nBoth  stood  still  and  gazed  at  one  another,  as\nthough measuring their strength.\n'From  all  your  half  tipsy  stories,'  Raskolnikov\nobserved  harshly,  'I  am  positive  that  you  have\nnot given up your designs on my sister, but are\npursuing  them  more  actively  than  ever.  I  have\nlearnt  that  my  sister  received  a  letter  this\nmorning.  You  have  hardly  been  able  to  sit  still\nall this time.... You may have unearthed a wife\non  the  way,  but  that  means  nothing.  I  should", "like to make certain myself.'\nRaskolnikov  could  hardly  have  said  himself\nwhat he wanted and of what he wished to make\ncertain.\n'Upon my word! I'll call the police!'\n'Call away!'\nAgain they stood for a minute facing each other.\nAt  last  Svidrigaïlov's  face  changed.  Having\nsatisfied himself that \nRaskolnikov was not frightened at his threat, he\nassumed a mirthful and friendly air.\n'What  a  fellow!  I  purposely  refrained  from\nreferring to your affair, though I am devoured by\ncuriosity. It's a fantas-(cid:24)(cid:24) tic affair. I've put it off till\nanother  time,  but  you're  enough  to  rouse  the\ndead....  Well,  let  us  go,  only  I  warn  you\nbeforehand  I  am  only  going  home  for  a\nmoment,  to  get  some  money;  then  I  shall  lock\nup  the  flat,  take  a  cab  and  go  to  spend  the\nevening at the Islands. Now, now are you going\nto follow me?'", "'I'm coming to your lodgings, not to see you but\nSofya Semyonovna, to say I'm sorry not to have\nbeen at the funeral.'\n'That's  as  you  like,  but  Sofya  Semyonovna  is\nnot  at  home.  She  has  taken  the  three  children\nto  an  old  lady  of  high  rank,  the  patroness  of\nsome  orphan  asylums,  whom  I  used  to  know\nyears ago. I charmed the old lady by depositing\na sum of money with her to provide for the three\nchildren  of  Katerina  Ivanovna  and  subscribing\nto the institution as well. I told her too the story\nof Sofya Semyonovna in full detail, suppressing\nnothing.  It  produced  an  indescribable  effect  on\nher.  That's  why  Sofya  Semyonovna  has  been\ninvited  to  call  to-day  at  the  X.  Hotel  where  the\nlady is staying for the time.'\n'No matter, I'll come all the same.'\n'As you like, it's nothing to me, but I won't come\nwith  you;  here  we  are  at  home.  By  the  way,  I\nam  convinced  that  you  regard  me  with\nsuspicion  just  because  I  have  shown  such\ndelicacy  and  have  not  so  far  troubled  you  with\nquestions  ...  you  understand?  It  struck  you  as", "extraordinary; I don't mind betting it's that. Well,\nit teaches one to show delicacy!'\n'And  to  listen  at  doors!'(cid:24)  'Ah,  that's  it,  is  it?'\nlaughed  Svidrigaïlov.  'Yes,  I  should  have  been\nsurprised  if  you  had  let  that  pass  after  all  that\nhas happened. Ha-ha! Though I did understand\nsomething  of  the  pranks  you  had  been  up  to\nand  were  telling  Sofya  Semyonovna  about,\nwhat was the meaning of it? Perhaps I am quite\nbehind  the  times  and  can't  understand.  For\ngoodness'  sake,  explain  it,  my  dear  boy.\nExpound the latest theories!'\n'You  couldn't  have  heard  anything.  You're\nmaking it all up!'\n'But I'm not talking about that (though I did hear\nsomething). No, I'm talking of the way you keep\nsighing and groaning now. The Schiller in you is\nin revolt every moment, and now you tell me not\nto listen at doors. If that's how you feel, go and\ninform  the  police  that  you  had  this  mischance:\nyou  made  a  little  mistake  in  your  theory.  But  if\nyou  are  convinced  that  one  mustn't  listen  at\ndoors, but one may murder old women at one's\npleasure,  you'd  better  be  off  to  America  and", "make  haste.  Run,  young  man!  There  may  still\nbe time. I'm speaking sincerely. Haven't you the\nmoney? I'll give you the fare.'\n'I'm  not  thinking  of  that  at  all,'  Raskolnikov\ninterrupted with disgust.\n'I  understand  (but  don't  put  yourself  out,  don't\ndiscuss it if you don't want to). I understand the\nquestions  you  are  worrying  over-  moral  ones,\naren't  they?  Duties  of  citizen  and  man?  Lay\nthem  all  aside.  They  are  nothing  to  you  now,\nha-ha!  You'll  say  you  are  still  a  man  and  a\ncitizen. If so you ought not to have got into this\ncoil. It's no use taking up a (cid:24)(cid:24) job you are not fit\nfor.  Well,  you'd  better  shoot  yourself,  or  don't\nyou want to?'\n'You  seem  trying  to  enrage  me,  to  make  me\nleave you.'\n'What  a  queer  fellow!  But  here  we  are.\nWelcome  to  the  staircase.  You  see,  that's  the\nway  to  Sofya  Semyonovna.  Look,  there  is  no\none  at  home.  Don't  you  believe  me?  Ask\nKapernaumov.  She  leaves  the  key  with  him.\nHere is Madame de Kapernaumov herself. Hey,", "what?  She  is  rather  deaf.  Has  she  gone  out?\nWhere? Did you hear? She is not in and won't\nbe  till  late  in  the  evening  probably.  Well,  come\nto my room; you wanted to come and see me,\ndidn't  you?  Here  we  are.  Madame  Resslich's\nnot  at  home.  She  is  a  woman  who  is  always\nbusy,  an  excellent  woman  I  assure  you....  She\nmight have been of use to you if you had been\na  little  more  sensible.  Now,  see!  I  take  this\nfive-per-cent bond out of the bureau-see what a\nlot  I've  got  of  them  still-this  one  will  be  turned\ninto cash to-day. I mustn't waste any more time.\nThe  bureau  is  locked,  the  flat  is  locked,  and\nhere we are again on the stairs. Shall we take a\ncab? I'm going to the Islands. Would you like a\nlift?  I'll  take  this  carriage.  Ah,  you  refuse?  You\nare tired of it! Come for a drive! I believe it will\ncome on to rain. Never mind, we'll put down the\nhood....'\nSvidrigaïlov  was  already  in  the  carriage.\nRaskolnikov decided that his suspicions were at\nleast for that moment unjust. Without answering\na word he turned and walked back towards the\nHay Market. If he had only turned round on his\nway he might have seen Svidrigaïlov get out not\na hundred paces off, dismiss the cab and walk", "along  the  pavement.  But  he  had  turned  the\ncorner  and  could  see  nothing.  (cid:24)(cid:24)0  Crime  and\nPunishment  Intense  disgust  drew  him  away\nfrom Svidrigaïlov.\n'To think that I could for one instant have looked\nfor  help  from  that  coarse  brute,  that  depraved\nsensualist and blackguard!' he cried.\nRaskolnikov's    judgment    was    uttered    too \nlightly    and  hastily:    there    was    something \nabout    Svidrigaïlov    which  gave  him  a  certain\noriginal,  even  a  mysterious  character.  As\nconcerned  his  sister,  Raskolnikov  was\nconvinced that Svidrigaïlov would not leave her\nin  peace.  But  it  was  too  tiresome  and\nunbearable to go on thinking and thinking about\nthis.\nWhen  he  was  alone,  he  had  not  gone  twenty\npaces  before  he  sank,  as  usual,  into  deep\nthought.  On  the  bridge  he  stood  by  the  railing\nand  began  gazing  at  the  water.  And  his  sister\nwas standing close by him.\nHe  met  her  at  the  entrance  to  the  bridge,  but\npassed  by  without  seeing  her.  Dounia  had", "never met him like this in the street before and\nwas struck with dismay. She stood still and did\nnot know whether to call to him or not. Suddenly\nshe  saw  Svidrigaïlov  coming  quickly  from  the\ndirection of the Hay Market.\nHe  seemed  to  be  approaching  cautiously.  He\ndid not go on to the bridge, but stood aside on\nthe  pavement,  doing  all  he  could  to  avoid\nRaskolnikov's  seeing  him.  He  had  observed\nDounia  for  some  time  and  had  been  making\nsigns  to  her.  She  fancied  he  was  signalling  to\nbeg her not to speak to her brother, but to come\nto him.\nThat  was  what  Dounia  did.  She  stole  by  her\nbrother  and  went  up  to  Svidrigaïlov.(cid:24)1  'Let  us\nmake  haste  away,'  Svidrigaïlov  whispered  to\nher, 'I don't want Rodion Romanovitch to know\nof our meeting. I must tell you I've been sitting\nwith  him  in  the  restaurant  close  by,  where  he\nlooked me up and I had great difficulty in getting\nrid of him. He has somehow heard of my letter\nto  you  and  suspects  something.  It  wasn't  you\nwho  told  him,  of  course,  but  if  not  you,  who\nthen?'", "'Well,  we've  turned  the  corner  now,'  Dounia\ninterrupted,  'and  my  brother  won't  see  us.  I\nhave to tell you that I am going no further with\nyou. Speak to me here. You can tell it all in the\nstreet.'\n'In  the  first  place,  I  can't  say  it  in  the  street;\nsecondly,  you  must  hear  Sofya  Semyonovna\ntoo; and, thirdly, I will show you some papers....\nOh  well,  if  you  won't  agree  to  come  with  me,  I\nshall  refuse  to  give  any  explanation  and  go\naway at once. But I beg you not to forget that a\nvery curious secret of your beloved brother's is\nentirely in my keeping.'\nDounia  stood  still,  hesitating,  and  looked  at\nSvidrigaïlov with searching eyes.\n'What  are  you  afraid  of?'  he  observed  quietly.\n'The  town  is  not  the  country.  And  even  in  the\ncountry you did me more harm than I did you.'\n'Have you prepared Sofya Semyonovna?'\n'No,  I  have  not  said  a  word  to  her  and  am  not\nquite  certain  whether  she  is  at  home  now.  But\nmost  likely  she  is.  She  has  buried  her", "stepmother to-day: she is not likely to go visiting\non  such  a  day.  For  the  time  I  don't  want  to\nspeak  to  anyone  about  it  and  I  half  regret\nhaving spoken to you. The slightest indiscretion\nis as bad as betrayal in a thing like (cid:24) this. I live\nthere in that house, we are coming to it. That's\nthe porter of our house-he knows me very well;\nyou see, he's bowing; he sees I'm coming with\na  lady  and  no  doubt  he  has  noticed  your  face\nalready  and  you  will  be  glad  of  that  if  you  are\nafraid of me and suspicious. Excuse my putting\nthings  so  coarsely.  I  haven't  a  flat  to  myself;\nSofya  Semyonovna's  room  is  next  to  mine-she\nlodges in the next flat. The whole floor is let out\nin lodgings. Why are you frightened like a child?\nAm I really so terrible?'\nSvidrigaïlov's    lips    were    twisted    in    a \ncondescending smile; but he was in no smiling\nmood.  His  heart  was  throbbing  and  he  could\nscarcely breathe. He spoke rather loud to cover\nhis  growing  excitement.  But  Dounia  did  not\nnotice  this  peculiar  excitement,  she  was  so\nirritated  by  his  remark  that  she  was  frightened\nof him like a child and that he was so terrible to\nher.", "'Though  I  know  that  you  are  not  a  man  ...  of\nhonour, I am not in the least afraid of you. Lead\nthe  way,'  she  said  with  apparent  composure,\nbut her face was very pale.\nSvidrigaïlov stopped at Sonia's room.\n'Allow me to inquire whether she is at home....\nShe  is  not.  How  unfortunate!  But  I  know  she\nmay come quite soon. If she's gone out, it can\nonly be to see a lady about the orphans. Their\nmother  is  dead....  I've  been  meddling  and\nmaking  arrangements  for  them.  If  Sofya\nSemyonovna  does  not  come  back  in  ten\nminutes, I will send her to you, to-day if you like.\nThis  is  my  flat.  These  are  my  two  rooms.\nMadame  Resslich,  my  landlady,  has  the  next\nroom.  Now,  look  this  way.  I  will  show  you  my\nchief  piece  of  evidence:  this  door  from  my  (cid:24)(cid:24)\nbedroom leads into two perfectly empty rooms,\nwhich are to let. Here they are ... You must look\ninto them with some attention.'\nSvidrigaïlov  occupied  two  fairly  large  furnished\nrooms.  Dounia  was  looking  about  her\nmistrustfully,  but  saw  nothing  special  in  the\nfurniture or position of the rooms. Yet there was", "something  to  observe,  for  instance,  that\nSvidrigaïlov's flat was exactly between two sets\nof  almost  uninhabited  apartments.  His  rooms\nwere not entered directly from the passage,  but\n  through    the    landlady's    two    almost    empty\nrooms.  Unlocking  a  door  leading  out  of  his\nbedroom,  Svidrigaïlov  showed  Dounia  the  two\nempty rooms that were to let. Dounia stopped in\nthe doorway, not knowing what she was called\nto  look  upon,  but  Svidrigaïlov  hastened  to\nexplain.\n'Look  here,  at  this  second  large  room.  Notice\nthat door, it's locked. By the door stands a chair,\nthe only one in the two rooms. I brought it from\nmy  rooms  so  as  to  listen  more  conveniently.\nJust  the  other  side  of  the  door  is  Sofya\nSemyonovna's  table;  she  sat  there  talking  to\nRodion  Romanovitch.  And  I  sat  here  listening\non two successive evenings, for two hours each\ntime-and  of  course  I  was  able  to  learn\nsomething, what do you think?'\n'You listened?'\n'Yes,  I  did.  Now  come  back  to  my  room;  we\ncan't sit down here.'", "He  brought  Avdotya  Romanovna  back  into  his\nsittingroom  and  offered  her  a  chair.  He  sat\ndown at the opposite side of the table, at least\nseven  feet  from  her,  but  probably  (cid:24)  there  was\nthe  same  glow  in  his  eyes  which  had  once\nfrightened Dounia so much. She shuddered and\nonce more looked about her distrustfully. It was\nan  involuntary  gesture;  she  evidently  did  not\nwish to betray her uneasiness. But the secluded\nposition  of  Svidrigaïlov's  lodging  had  suddenly\nstruck  her.  She  wanted  to  ask  whether  his\nlandlady  at  least  were  at  home,  but  pride  kept\nher  from  asking.  Moreover,  she  had  another\ntrouble  in  her  heart  incomparably  greater  than\nfear for herself. She was in great distress.\n'Here  is  your  letter,'  she  said,  laying  it  on  the\ntable. 'Can it be true what you write? You hint at\na crime committed, you say, by my brother. You\nhint  at  it  too  clearly;  you  daren't  deny  it  now.  I\nmust  tell  you  that  I'd  heard  of  this  stupid  story\nbefore you wrote and don't believe a word of it.\nIt's a disgusting and ridiculous suspicion. I know\nthe story and why and how it was invented. You\ncan  have  no  proofs.  You  promised  to  prove  it.\nSpeak! But let me warn you that I don't believe", "you! I don't believe you!'\nDounia said this, speaking hurriedly, and for an\ninstant the colour rushed to her face.\n'If  you  didn't  believe  it,  how  could  you  risk\ncoming  alone  to  my  rooms?  Why  have  you\ncome? Simply from curiosity?'\n'Don't torment me. Speak, speak!'\n'There's  no  denying  that  you  are  a  brave  girl.\nUpon my word, I thought you would have asked\nMr.  Razumihin  to  escort  you  here.  But  he  was\nnot  with  you  nor  anywhere  near.  I  was  on  the\nlook-out.  It's  spirited  of  you,  it  proves  you\nwanted  to  spare  Rodion  Romanovitch.  But\neverything  is  divine  in  you....  About  your\nbrother, what am I to say to you? (cid:24)(cid:24) You've just\nseen him yourself. What did you think of him?'\n'Surely that's not the only thing you are building\non?'\n'No, not on that, but on his own words. He came\nhere on two successive evenings to see Sofya\nSemyonovna.  I've  shown  you  where  they  sat.", "He  made  a  full  confession  to  her.  He  is  a\nmurderer.  He  killed  an  old  woman,  a\npawnbroker,  with  whom  he  had  pawned  things\nhimself. He killed her sister too, a pedlar woman\ncalled Lizaveta, who happened to come in while\nhe was murdering her sister. He killed them with\nan axe he brought with him. He murdered them\nto  rob  them  and  he  did  rob  them.  He  took\nmoney  and  various  things....  He  told  all  this,\nword  for  word,  to  Sofya  Semyonovna,  the  only\nperson who knows his secret. But she has had\nno  share  by  word  or  deed  in  the  murder;  she\nwas as horrified at it as you are now. Don't be\nanxious, she won't betray him.'\n'It cannot be,' muttered Dounia, with white lips.\nShe gasped for breath. 'It cannot be. There was\nnot the slightest cause, no sort of ground.... It's\na lie, a lie!'\n'He  robbed  her,  that  was  the  cause,  he  took\nmoney  and  things.  It's  true  that  by  his  own\nadmission  he  made  no  use  of  the  money  or\nthings, but hid them under a stone, where they\nare  now.  But  that  was  because  he  dared  not\nmake use of them.'", "'But  how  could  he  steal,  rob?  How  could  he\ndream of it?' cried Dounia, and she jumped up\nfrom the chair. 'Why, you know him, and you've\nseen him, can he be a thief?'\nShe  seemed  to  be  imploring  Svidrigaïlov;  she\nhad  entirely  forgotten  her  fear.(cid:24)  'There  are\nthousands  and  millions  of  combinations  and\npossibilities, Avdotya Romanovna. A thief steals\nand knows he is a scoundrel, but I've heard of a\ngentleman  who  broke  open  the  mail.  Who\nknows,  very  likely  he  thought  he  was  doing  a\ngentlemanly thing! Of course I should not have\nbelieved  it  myself  if  I'd  been  told  of  it  as  you\nhave, but I believe my own ears. He explained\nall  the  causes  of  it  to  Sofya  Semyonovna  too,\nbut she did not believe her ears at first, yet she\nbelieved her own eyes at last.'\n'What ... were the causes?'\n'It's a long story, Avdotya Romanovna. Here's ...\nhow  shall  I  tell  you?-A  theory  of  a  sort,  the\nsame one by which I for instance consider that\na  single  misdeed  is  permissible  if  the  principal\naim is right, a solitary wrongdoing and hundreds\nof  good  deeds!  It's  galling  too,  of  course,  for  a", "young  man  of  gifts  and  overweening  pride  to\nknow that if he had, for instance, a paltry three\nthousand,  his  whole  career,  his  whole  future\nwould be differently shaped and yet not to have\nthat  three  thousand.  Add  to  that,  nervous\nirritability  from  hunger,  from  lodging  in  a  hole,\nfrom  rags,  from  a  vivid  sense  of  the  charm  of\nhis social position and his sister's and mother's\nposition too. Above all, vanity, pride and vanity,\nthough  goodness  knows  he  may  have  good\nqualities  too....  I  am  not  blaming  him,  please\ndon't  think  it;  besides,  it's  not  my  business.  A\nspecial  little  theory  came  in  too-a  theory  of  a\nsort-dividing  mankind,  you  see,  into  material\nand superior persons, that is persons to whom\nthe  law  does  not  apply  owing  to  their\nsuperiority,  who  make  laws  for  the  rest  of\nmankind, the material, that is. It's all right as a\ntheory,  (cid:24)(cid:24)  une  théorie  comme  une  autre.\nNapoleon  attracted  him  tremendously,  that  is,\nwhat affected him was that a great many men of\ngenius  have  not  hesitated  at  wrongdoing,  but\nhave  overstepped  the  law  without  thinking\nabout it. He seems to have fancied that he was\na genius too-that is, he was convinced of it for a\ntime.  He  has  suffered  a  great  deal  and  is  still\nsuffering  from  the  idea  that  he  could  make  a", "theory,  but  was  incapable  of  boldly\noverstepping the law, and so he is not a man of\ngenius. And that's humiliating for a young man\nof any pride, in our day especially....'\n'But remorse? You deny him any moral feeling\nthen? Is he like that?'\n'Ah,  Avdotya  Romanovna,  everything  is  in  a\nmuddle  now;  not  that  it  was  ever  in  very  good\norder.  Russians  in  general  are  broad  in  their\nideas,  Avdotya  Romanovna,  broad  like  their\nland and exceedingly disposed to the fantastic,\nthe  chaotic.  But  it's  a  misfortune  to  be  broad\nwithout  a  special  genius.  Do  you  remember\nwhat  a  lot  of  talk  we  had  together  on  this\nsubject,  sitting  in  the  evenings  on  the  terrace\nafter  supper?  Why,  you  used  to  reproach  me\nwith  breadth!  Who  knows,  perhaps  we  were\ntalking at the very time when he was lying here\nthinking  over  his  plan.  There  are  no  sacred\ntraditions  amongst  us,  especially  in  the\neducated  class,  Avdotya  Romanovna.  At  the\nbest someone will make them up somehow for\nhimself out of books or from some old chronicle.\nBut those are for the most part the learned and\nall old fogeys, so that it would be almost ill-bred", "in  a  man  of  society.  You  know  my  opinions  in\ngeneral,  though.  I  never  blame  anyone.  I  do\nnothing  at  all,  I  persevere  in  that.  But  (cid:24)  we've\ntalked  of  this  more  than  once  before.  I  was  so\nhappy  indeed  as  to  interest  you  in  my\nopinions....  You  are  very  pale,  Avdotya\nRomanovna.'\n'I know his theory. I read that article of his about\nmen  to  whom  all  is  permitted.  Razumihin\nbrought it to me.'\n'Mr.  Razumihin?  Your  brother's  article?  In  a\nmagazine?  Is  there  such  an  article?  I  didn't\nknow. It must be interesting. But where are you\ngoing, Avdotya Romanovna?'\n'I  want  to  see  Sofya  Semyonovna,'  Dounia\narticulated faintly. 'How do I go to her? She has\ncome  in,  perhaps.  I  must  see  her  at  once.\nPerhaps she ...'\nAvdotya  Romanovna  could  not  finish.  Her\nbreath literally failed her.\n'Sofya Semyonovna will not be back till night, at\nleast I believe not. She was to have been back", "at  once,  but  if  not,  then  she  will  not  be  in  till\nquite late.'\n'Ah, then you are lying! I see ... you were lying\n... lying all the time.... I don't believe you! I don't\nbelieve  you!'  cried  Dounia,  completely  losing\nher head.\nAlmost  fainting,  she  sank  on  to  a  chair  which\nSvidrigaïlov  made  haste  to  give  her.'Avdotya\nRomanovna,  what  is  it?  Control  yourself!  Here\nis some water. Drink a little....'\nHe  sprinkled  some  water  over  her.  Dounia\nshuddered and came to herself.\n'It  has  acted  violently,'  Svidrigaïlov  muttered  to\nhimself,  frowning.  'Avdotya  Romanovna,  calm\nyourself!  Believe  me,  he  has  friends.  We  will\nsave  him.  Would  you  like  me  to  take  him\nabroad?  I  have  money,  I  can  get  a  ticket  in\nthree days. (cid:24)(cid:24) And as for the murder, he will do\nall sorts of good deeds yet, to atone for it. Calm\nyourself.  He  may  become  a  great  man  yet.\nWell, how are you? How do you feel?'\n'Cruel man! To be able to jeer at it! Let me go", "...'\n'Where are you going?'\n'To  him.  Where  is  he?  Do  you  know?  Why  is\nthis door locked? We came in at that door and\nnow it is locked. When did you manage to lock\nit?'\n'We  couldn't  be  shouting  all  over  the  flat  on\nsuch a subject. I am far from jeering; it's simply\nthat I'm sick of talking like this. But how can you\ngo in such a state? Do you want to betray him?\nYou  will  drive  him  to  fury,  and  he  will  give\nhimself up. Let me tell you, he is already being\nwatched; they are already on his track. You will\nsimply  be  giving  him  away.  Wait  a  little:  I  saw\nhim and was talking to him just now. He can still\nbe  saved.  Wait  a  bit,  sit  down;  let  us  think  it\nover  together.  I  asked  you  to  come  in  order  to\ndiscuss  it  alone  with  you  and  to  consider  it\nthoroughly. But do sit down!'\n'How  can  you  save  him?  Can  he  really  be\nsaved?'\nDounia sat down. Svidrigaïlov sat down beside", "her.\n'It all depends on you, on you, on you alone,' he\nbegin  with  glowing  eyes,  almost  in  a  whisper\nand hardly able to utter the words for emotion.\nDounia  drew  back  from  him  in  alarm.  He  too\nwas trembling all over.\n'You ... one word from you, and he is saved. I ...\nI'll save him. I have money and friends. I'll send\nhim  away  at  once.  I'll  get  a  passport,  two\npassports,  one  for  him  and  one  for  me.  I  have\nfriends ... capable people.... If you like, I'll take\n(cid:24)(cid:24)0 Crime and Punishment a passport for you ...\nfor  your  mother....  What  do  you  want  with\nRazumihin? I love you too.... I love you beyond\neverything.... Let me kiss the hem of your dress,\nlet me, let me.... The very rustle of it is too much\nfor  me.  Tell  me,  'do  that,'  and  I'll  do  it.  I'll  do\neverything.  I  will  do  the  impossible.  What  you\nbelieve, I will believe. I'll do anything -anything!\nDon't,  don't  look  at  me  like  that.  Do  you  know\nthat you are killing me? ...'\nHe was almost beginning to rave.... Something\nseemed  suddenly  to  go  to  his  head.  Dounia", "jumped up and rushed to the door.\n'Open it! Open it!' she called, shaking the door.\n'Open it! Is there no one there?'\nSvidrigaïlov got up and came to himself. His still\ntrembling  lips  slowly  broke  into  an  angry\nmocking smile.\n'There  is  no  one  at  home,'  he  said  quietly  and\nemphatically.  'The  landlady  has  gone  out,  and\nit's waste of time to shout like that. You are only\nexciting yourself uselessly.'\n'Where  is  the  key?  Open  the  door  at  once,  at\nonce, base man!'\n'I have lost the key and cannot find it.'\n'This  is  an  outrage,'  cried  Dounia,  turning  pale\nas  death.  She  rushed  to  the  furthest  corner,\nwhere she made haste to barricade herself with\na little table.\nShe did not scream, but she fixed her eyes on\nher tormentor and watched every movement he\nmade.", "Svidrigaïlov remained standing at the other end\nof  the  room  facing  her.  He  was  positively\ncomposed, at least in appearance, but his face\nwas  pale  as  before.  The  mocking  (cid:24)1  smile  did\nnot leave his face.\n'You  spoke  of  outrage  just  now,  Avdotya\nRomanovna. In that case you may be sure I've\ntaken  measures.  Sofya  Semyonovna  is  not  at\nhome.  The  Kapernaumovs  are  far  away-there\nare  five  locked  rooms  between.  I  am  at  least\ntwice as strong as you are and I have nothing to\nfear,  besides.  For  you  could  not  complain\nafterwards.  You  surely  would  not  be  willing\nactually to betray your brother? Besides, no one\nwould  believe  you.  How  should  a  girl  have\ncome  alone  to  visit  a  solitary  man  in  his\nlodgings? So that even if you do sacrifice your\nbrother,  you  could  prove  nothing.  It  is  very\ndifficult  to  prove  an  assault,  Avdotya\nRomanovna.'\n'Scoundrel!' whispered Dounia indignantly.\n'As you like, but observe I was only speaking by\nway  of  a  general  proposition.  It's  my  personal", "conviction  that  you  are  perfectly  right  -violence\nis  hateful.  I  only  spoke  to  show  you  that  you\nneed  have  no  remorse  even  if  ...  you  were\nwilling to save your brother of your own accord,\nas  I  suggest  to  you.  You  would  be  simply\nsubmitting to circumstances, to violence, in fact,\nif  we  must  use  that  word.  Think  about  it.  Your\nbrother's  and  your  mother's  fate  are  in  your\nhands. I will be your slave ... all my life ... I will\nwait here.'\nSvidrigaïlov  sat  down  on  the  sofa  about  eight\nsteps  from  Dounia.  She  had  not  the  slightest\ndoubt  now  of  his  unbending  determination.\nBesides,  she  knew  him.  Suddenly  she  pulled\nout of her pocket a revolver, cocked it and laid it\nin  her  hand  on  the  table.  Svidrigaïlov  jumped\nup.\n'Aha!  So  that's  it,  is  it?'  he  cried,  surprised  but\nsmiling maliciously. 'Well, that completely alters\nthe  aspect  of  (cid:24)  affairs.  You've  made  things\nwonderfully easier for me, Avdotya Romanovna.\nBut where did you get the revolver? Was it Mr.\nRazumihin? Why, it's my revolver, an old friend!\nAnd how I've hunted for it! The shooting lessons\nI've  given  you  in  the  country  have  not  been", "thrown away.'\n'It's  not  your  revolver,  it  belonged  to  Marfa\nPetrovna,  whom  you  killed,  wretch!  There  was\nnothing  of  yours  in  her  house.  I  took  it  when  I\nbegan  to  suspect  what  you  were  capable  of.  If\nyou  dare  to  advance  one  step,  I  swear  I'll  kill\nyou.' She was frantic.\n'But  your  brother?  I  ask  from  curiosity,'  said\nSvidrigaïlov, still standing where he was.\n'Inform,  if  you  want  to!  Don't  stir!  Don't  come\nnearer!  I'll  shoot!  You  poisoned  your  wife,  I\nknow;  you  are  a  murderer  yourself!'  She  held\nthe revolver ready.\n'Are  you  so  positive  I  poisoned  Marfa\nPetrovna?'\n'You  did!  You  hinted  it  yourself;  you  talked  to\nme of poison.... I know you went to get it ... you\nhad  it  in  readiness....  It  was  your  doing....  It\nmust have been your doing.... Scoundrel!'\n'Even  if  that  were  true,  it  would  have  been  for\nyour sake ... you would have been the cause.'", "'You are lying! I hated you always, always....'\n'Oho,  Avdotya  Romanovna!  You  seem  to  have\nforgotten how you softened to me in the heat of\npropaganda.  I  saw  it  in  your  eyes.  Do  you\nremember  that  moonlight  night,  when  the\nnightingale was singing?'\n'That's  a  lie,'  there  was  a  flash  of  fury  in\nDounia's eyes, 'that's a lie and a libel!'(cid:24)(cid:24) 'A lie?\nWell, if you like, it's a lie. I made it up. Women\nought  not  to  be  reminded  of  such  things,'  he\nsmiled.  'I  know  you  will  shoot,  you  pretty  wild\ncreature. Well, shoot away!'\nDounia  raised  the  revolver,  and  deadly  pale,\ngazed  at  him,  measuring  the  distance  and\nawaiting  the  first  movement  on  his  part.  Her\nlower  lip  was  white  and  quivering  and  her  big\nblack eyes flashed like fire. He had never seen\nher so handsome. The fire glowing in her eyes\nat the moment she raised the revolver seemed\nto kindle him and there was a pang of anguish\nin his heart. He took a step forward and a shot\nrang  out.  The  bullet  grazed  his  hair  and  flew\ninto the wall behind. He stood still and laughed", "softly.\n'The wasp has stung me. She aimed straight at\nmy head. What's this? Blood?' he pulled out his\nhandkerchief to wipe the blood, which flowed in\na thin stream down his right temple. The bullet\nseemed to have just grazed the skin.\nDounia  lowered  the  revolver  and  looked  at\nSvidrigaïlov not so much in terror as in a sort of\nwild  amazement.  She  seemed  not  to\nunderstand  what  she  was  doing  and  what  was\ngoing on.\n'Well,  you  missed!  Fire  again,  I'll  wait,'  said\nSvidrigaïlov  softly,  still  smiling,  but  gloomily.  'If\nyou  go  on  like  that,  I  shall  have  time  to  seize\nyou before you cock again.'\nDounia  started,  quickly  cocked  the  pistol  and\nagain raised it.\n'Let  me  be,'  she  cried  in  despair.  'I  swear  I'll\nshoot again. I ... I'll kill you.'\n'Well  ...  at  three  paces  you  can  hardly  help  it.\nBut  if  you  don't  ...  then.'  His  eyes  flashed  and", "he took two steps for(cid:24) ward. Dounia shot again:\nit missed fire.\n'You haven't loaded it properly. Never mind, you\nhave  another  charge  there.  Get  it  ready,  I'll\nwait.'\nHe  stood  facing  her,  two  paces  away,  waiting\nand  gazing  at  her  with  wild  determination,  with\nfeverishly  passionate,  stubborn,  set  eyes.\nDounia  saw  that  he  would  sooner  die  than  let\nher  go.  'And  ...  now,  of  course  she  would  kill\nhim, at two paces!' Suddenly she flung away the\nrevolver.\n'She's  dropped  it!'  said  Svidrigaïlov  with\nsurprise, and he drew a deep breath. A weight\nseemed  to  have  rolled  from  his  heart-perhaps\nnot  only  the  fear  of  death;  indeed  he  may\nscarcely have felt it at that moment. It was the\ndeliverance  from  another  feeling,  darker  and\nmore  bitter,  which  he  could  not  himself  have\ndefined.\nHe went to Dounia and gently put his arm round\nher waist. She did not resist, but, trembling like\na  leaf,  looked  at  him  with  suppliant  eyes.  He", "tried  to  say  something,  but  his  lips  moved\nwithout being able to utter a sound.\n'Let  me  go,'  Dounia  implored.  Svidrigaïlov\nshuddered. Her voice now was quite different.\n'Then  you  don't  love  me?'  he  asked  softly.\nDounia shook her head.\n'And ... and you can't? Never?' he whispered in\ndespair.\n'Never!'\nThere  followed  a  moment  of  terrible,  dumb\nstruggle  in  the  heart  of  Svidrigaïlov.  He  looked\nat her with an indescribable gaze. Suddenly he\nwithdrew his arm, turned quickly to the window\nand stood facing it. Another moment passed.\n'Here's  the  key.'(cid:24)(cid:24)  He  took  it  out  of  the  left\npocket of his coat and laid it on the table behind\nhim, without turning or looking at Dounia.\n'Take it! Make haste!'\nHe looked stubbornly out of the window. Dounia", "went up to the table to take the key.\n'Make  haste!  Make  haste!'  repeated\nSvidrigaïlov, still without turning or moving. But\nthere seemed a terrible significance in the tone\nof that 'make haste.'\nDounia understood it, snatched up the key, flew\nto the door, unlocked it quickly and rushed out\nof the room. A minute later, beside herself, she\nran out on to the canal bank in the direction of\nX. Bridge.\nSvidrigaïlov remained three minutes standing at\nthe  window.  At  last  he  slowly  turned,  looked\nabout  him  and  passed  his  hand  over  his\nforehead. A strange smile contorted his face, a\npitiful, sad, weak smile, a smile of despair. The\nblood,  which  was  already  getting  dry,  smeared\nhis hand. \nHe looked angrily at it, then wetted a towel and\nwashed his temple. The revolver which Dounia\nhad flung away lay near the door and suddenly\ncaught his eye. He picked it up and examined it.\nIt  was  a  little  pocket  three-barrel  revolver  of\nold-fashioned construction. There were still two", "charges  and  one  capsule  left  in  it.  It  could  be\nfired again. He thought a little, put the revolver\nin his pocket, took his hat and went out.(cid:24) ", "#$#$Chapter 42#$#$\nHe spent that evening till ten o'clock going from\none low \nhaunt to another. Katia too turned up and sang\nanother  gutter  song,  how  a  certain  'villain  and\ntyrant began kissing Katia.'\nSvidrigaïlov treated Katia and the organ-grinder\nand some singers and the waiters and two little\nclerks.  He  was  particularly  drawn  to  these\nclerks  by  the  fact  that  they  both  had  crooked\nnoses, one bent to the left and the other to the\nright.  They  took  him  finally  to  a  pleasure\ngarden, where he paid for their entrance. There\nwas  one  lanky  three-  year-old  pine-tree  and\nthree  bushes  in  the  garden,  besides  a\n'Vauxhall,'  which  was  in  reality  a  drinking-bar\nwhere tea too was served, and there were a few\ngreen  tables  and  chairs  standing  round  it.  A\nchorus  of  wretched  singers  and  a  drunken  but\nexceedingly  depressed  German  clown  from\nMunich  with  a  red  nose  entertained  the  public.\nThe  clerks  quarrelled  with  some  other  clerks", "and a fight seemed imminent. Svidrigaïlov was\nchosen  to  decide  the  dispute.  He  listened  to\nthem for a quarter of an hour, but they shouted\nso  loud  that  there  was  no  possibility  of\nunderstanding them. The only fact that seemed\ncertain  was  that  one  of  them  had  stolen\nsomething and had even succeeded in selling it\non  the  spot  to  a  Jew,  but  would  not  share  the\nspoil  with  his  companion.  Finally  it  appeared\nthat  the  stolen  object  was  a  teaspoon  be-(cid:24)(cid:24)\nlonging  to  the  Vauxhall.  It  was  missed  and  the\naffair  began  to  seem  troublesome.  Svidrigaïlov\npaid  for  the  spoon,  got  up,  and  walked  out  of\nthe garden. It was about six o'clock. He had not\ndrunk  a  drop  of  wine  all  this  time  and  had\nordered  tea  more  for  the  sake  of  appearances\nthan anything.\nIt  was  a  dark  and  stifling  evening.  Threatening\nstormclouds  came  over  the  sky  about  ten\no'clock.  There  was  a  clap  of  thunder,  and  the\nrain  came  down  like  a  waterfall.  The  water  fell\nnot  in  drops,  but  beat  on  the  earth  in  streams.\nThere  were  flashes  of  lightning  every  minute\nand  each  flash  lasted  while  one  could  count\nfive.", "Drenched  to  the  skin,  he  went  home,  locked\nhimself  in,  opened  the  bureau,  took  out  all  his\nmoney  and  tore  up  two  or  three  papers.  Then,\nputting  the  money  in  his  pocket,  he  was  about\nto  change  his  clothes,  but,  looking  out  of  the\nwindow  and  listening  to  the  thunder  and  the\nrain,  he  gave  up  the  idea,  took  up  his  hat  and\nwent  out  of  the  room  without  locking  the  door.\nHe went straight to Sonia. She was at home.\nShe  was  not  alone:  the  four  Kapernaumov\nchildren  were  with  her.  She  was  giving  them\ntea.  She  received  Svidrigaïlov  in  respectful\nsilence,  looking  wonderingly  at  his  soaking\nclothes.  The  children  all  ran  away  at  once  in\nindescribable terror.\nSvidrigaïlov  sat  down  at  the  table  and  asked\nSonia to sit beside him. She timidly prepared to\nlisten.\n'I  may  be  going  to  America,  Sofya\nSemyonovna,' said \nSvidrigaïlov,  'and  as  I  am  probably  seeing  you\nfor  the  last  time,  I  have  come  to  make  some\narrangements.  Well,  did  (cid:24)  you  see  the  lady", "to-day? I know what she said to you, you need\nnot  tell  me.'  (Sonia  made  a  movement  and\nblushed.) 'Those people have their own way of\ndoing  things.  As  to  your  sisters  and  your\nbrother,  they  are  really  provided  for  and  the\nmoney  assigned  to  them  I've  put  into  safe\nkeeping  and  have  received  acknowledgments.\nYou  had  better  take  charge  of  the  receipts,  in\ncase  anything  happens.

Here  are  three  5-per-cent\nbonds  to  the  value  of  three  thousand  roubles.\nTake  those  for  yourself,  entirely  for  yourself,\nand  let  that  be  strictly  between  ourselves,  so\nthat no one knows of it, whatever you hear.

You'll need it for him, do you\nunderstand? Giving it to you is the same as my\ngiving  it  to  him.  Besides,  you  promised  Amalia\nIvanovna to pay what's owing. I heard you. How\ncan  you  undertake  such  obligations  so\nheedlessly,  Sofya  Semyonovna?  It  was\nKaterina Ivanovna's debt and not yours, so you\nought  not  to  have  taken  any  notice  of  the\nGerman  woman.  You  can't  get  through  the\nworld like that.

She longed to speak,\nto ask a question, but for the first moments she\ndid not dare and did not know how to begin.\n'How can you ... how can you be going now, in\nsuch rain?'\n'Why,  be  starting  for  America,  and  be  stopped\nby rain!

Tell him Arkady Ivanovitch\nSvidrigaïlov sends his greetings. Be sure to.'(cid:24)00\nCrime  and  Punishment  He  went  out,  leaving\nSonia in a state of wondering anxiety and vague\napprehension.", "It  appeared  afterwards  that  on  the  same\nevening,  at  twenty  past  eleven,  he  made\nanother  very  eccentric  and  unexpected    visit. \nThe  rain  still  persisted.  Drenched  to the skin,\nhe walked into the little flat where the parents of\nhis  betrothed  lived,  in  Third  Street  in\nVassilyevsky  Island.  He  knocked  some  time\nbefore  he  was  admitted,  and  his  visit  at  first\ncaused  great  perturbation;  but  Svidrigaïlov\ncould be very fascinating when he liked, so that\nthe  first,  and  indeed  very  intelligent  surmise  of\nthe  sensible  parents  that  Svidrigaïlov  had\nprobably  had  so  much  to  drink  that  he  did  not\nknow what he was doing vanished immediately.\nThe  decrepit  father  was  wheeled  in  to  see\nSvidrigaïlov by the tender and sensible mother,\nwho  as  usual  began  the  conversation  with\nvarious irrelevant questions. She never asked a\ndirect  question,  but  began  by  smiling  and\nrubbing her hands and then, if she were obliged\nto  ascertain  something-for  instance,  when\nSvidrigaïlov would like to have the wedding-she\nwould  begin  by  interested  and  almost  eager\nquestions  about  Paris  and  the  court  life  there,\nand  only  by  degrees  brought  the  conversation\nround  to  Third  Street.  On  other  occasions  this", "had  of  course  been  very  impressive,  but  this\ntime  Arkady  Ivanovitch  seemed  particularly\nimpatient, and insisted on seeing his betrothed\nat once, though he had been informed, to begin\nwith, that she had already gone to bed. The girl\nof course appeared.\nSvidrigaïlov  informed  her  at  once  that  he  was\nobliged  by  very  important  affairs  to  leave\nPetersburg for a time, 01 and therefore brought\nher  fifteen  thousand  roubles  and  begged  her\naccept them as a present from him, as he had\nlong  been  intending  to  make  her  this  trifling\npresent  before  their  wedding.  The  logical\nconnection  of  the  present  with  his  immediate\ndeparture and the absolute necessity of visiting\nthem for that purpose in pouring rain at midnight\nwas not made clear. But it all went off very well;\neven  the  inevitable  ejaculations  of  wonder  and\nregret,  the  inevitable  questions  were\nextraordinarily few and restrained. On the other\nhand,  the  gratitude  expressed  was  most\nglowing  and  was  reinforced  by  tears  from  the\nmost  sensible  of  mothers.  Svidrigaïlov  got  up,\nlaughed, kissed his betrothed, patted her cheek,\ndeclared  he  would  soon  come  back,  and\nnoticing  in  her  eyes,  together  with  childish", "curiosity,  a  sort  of  earnest  dumb  inquiry,\nreflected  and  kissed  her  again,  though  he  felt\nsincere  anger  inwardly  at  the  thought  that  his\npresent would be immediately locked up in the\nkeeping  of  the  most  sensible  of  mothers.  He\nwent  away,  leaving  them  all  in  a  state  of\nextraordinary  excitement,  but  the  tender\nmamma,  speaking  quietly  in  a  half  whisper,\nsettled  some  of  the  most  important  of  their\ndoubts, concluding that Svidrigaïlov was a great\nman,  a  man  of  great  affairs  and  connections\nand of great wealth-there was no knowing what\nhe  had  in  his  mind.  He  would  start  off  on  a\njourney and give away money just as the fancy\ntook  him,  so  that  there  was  nothing  surprising\nabout  it.  Of  course  it  was  strange  that  he  was\nwet  through,  but  Englishmen,  for  instance,  are\neven  more  eccentric,  and  all  these  people  of\nhigh  society  didn't  think  of  what  was  said  of\nthem  and  didn't  stand  on  ceremony.  Pos(cid:24)0(cid:24)\nCrime  and  Punishment  sibly,  indeed,  he  came\nlike  that  on  purpose  to  show  that  he  was  not\nafraid  of  anyone.  Above  all,  not  a  word  should\nbe  said  about  it,  for  God  knows  what  might\ncome  of  it,  and  the  money  must  be  locked  up,\nand  it  was  most  fortunate  that  Fedosya,  the\ncook, had not left the kitchen. And above all not", "a  word  must  be  said  to  that  old  cat,  Madame\nResslich,  and  so  on  and  so  on.  They  sat  up\nwhispering  till  two  o'clock,  but  the  girl  went  to\nbed much earlier, amazed and rather sorrowful.\nSvidrigaïlov  meanwhile,  exactly  at  midnight,\ncrossed  the  bridge  on  the  way  back  to  the\nmainland. The rain had ceased and there was a\nroaring  wind.  He  began  shivering,  and  for  one\nmoment  he  gazed  at  the  black  waters  of  the\nLittle Neva with a look of special interest, even\ninquiry. But he soon felt it very cold, standing by\nthe  water;  he  turned  and  went  towards  Y.\nProspect.  He  walked  along  that  endless  street\nfor a long time, almost half an hour, more than\nonce  stumbling  in  the  dark  on  the  wooden\npavement, but continually looking for something\non  the  right  side  of  the  street.  He  had  noticed\npassing through this street lately that there was\na  hotel  somewhere  towards  the  end,  built  of\nwood,  but  fairly  large,  and  its  name  he\nremembered was something like Adrianople. He\nwas  not  mistaken:  the  hotel  was  so\nconspicuous in that God-forsaken place that he\ncould not fail to see it even in the dark. It was a\nlong, blackened wooden building, and in spite of\nthe  late  hour  there  were  lights  in  the  windows", "and signs of life within. He went in and asked a\nragged fellow who met him in the corridor for a\nroom.  The  latter,  scanning  Svidrigaïlov,  pulled\nhimself  together  and  0(cid:24)  led  him  at  once  to  a\nclose and tiny room in the distance, at the end\nof  the  corridor,  under  the  stairs.  There  was  no\nother,  all  were  occupied.  The  ragged  fellow\nlooked inquiringly.\n'Is there tea?' asked Svidrigaïlov.\n'Yes, sir.'\n'What else is there?'\n'Veal, vodka, savouries.'\n'Bring me tea and veal.'\n'And  you  want  nothing  else?'  he  asked  with\napparent surprise.\n'Nothing, nothing.'\nThe  ragged  man  went  away,  completely\ndisillusioned.", "'It  must  be  a  nice  place,'  thought  Svidrigaïlov.\n'How was it I didn't know it? I expect I look as if I\ncame from a café chantant and have had some\nadventure on the way. It would be interesting to\nknow who stay here?'\nHe  lighted  the  candle  and  looked  at  the  room\nmore  carefully.  It  was  a  room  so  low-pitched\nthat Svidrigaïlov could only just stand up in it; it\nhad one window; the bed, which was very dirty,\nand  the  plain-  stained  chair  and  table  almost\nfilled  it  up.  The  walls  looked  as  though  they\nwere  made  of  planks,  covered  with  shabby\npaper,  so  torn  and  dusty  that  the  pattern  was\nindistinguishable,  though  the  general\ncolour-yellow-could  still  be  made  out.  One  of\nthe  walls  was  cut  short  by  the  sloping  ceiling,\nthough the room was not an attic but just under\nthe stairs.\nSvidrigaïlov  set  down  the  candle,  sat  down  on\nthe  bed  and  sank  into  thought.  But  a  strange\npersistent  murmur  which  sometimes  rose  to  a\nshout  in  the  next  room  attracted  (cid:24)0(cid:24)  Crime  and\nPunishment  his  attention.  The  murmur  had  not\nceased from the moment he entered the room.\nHe  listened:  someone  was  upbraiding  and", "almost tearfully scolding, but he heard only one\nvoice.\nSvidrigaïlov  got  up,  shaded  the  light  with  his\nhand and at once he saw light through a crack\nin  the  wall;  he  went  up  and  peeped  through.\nThe room, which was somewhat larger than his,\nhad  two  occupants.  One  of  them,  a  very\ncurly-headed man with a red inflamed face, was\nstanding  in  the  pose  of  an  orator,  without  his\ncoat,  with  his  legs  wide  apart  to  preserve  his\nbalance, and smiting himself on the breast. He\nreproached the other with being a beggar, with\nhaving no standing whatever. He declared that\nhe had taken the other out of the gutter and he\ncould turn him out when he liked, and that only\nthe  finger  of  Providence  sees  it  all.  The  object\nof his reproaches was sitting in a chair, and had\nthe  air  of  a  man  who  wants  dreadfully  to\nsneeze,  but  can't.  He  sometimes  turned\nsheepish  and  befogged  eyes  on  the  speaker,\nbut obviously had not the slightest idea what he\nwas  talking  about  and  scarcely  heard  it.  A\ncandle  was  burning  down  on  the  table;  there\nwere  wine-glasses,  a  nearly  empty  bottle  of\nvodka,  bread  and  cucumber,  and  glasses  with\nthe dregs of stale tea. After gazing attentively at", "this, \nSvidrigaïlov  turned  away  indifferently  and  sat\ndown on the bed.\nThe  ragged  attendant,  returning  with  the  tea,\ncould  not  resist  asking  him  again  whether  he\ndidn't  want  anything  more,  and  again  receiving\na negative reply, finally withdrew. \nSvidrigaïlov made haste to drink a glass of tea\nto warm himself, but could not eat anything. He\nbegan  to  feel  feverish.  0(cid:24)  He  took  off  his  coat\nand,  wrapping  himself  in  the  blanket,  lay  down\non  the  bed.  He  was  annoyed.  'It  would  have\nbeen  better  to  be  well  for  the  occasion,'  he\nthought  with  a  smile.  The  room  was  close,  the\ncandle  burnt  dimly,  the  wind  was  roaring\noutside,  he  heard  a  mouse  scratching  in  the\ncorner  and  the  room  smelt  of  mice  and  of\nleather. He lay in a sort of reverie: one thought\nfollowed  another.  He  felt  a  longing  to  fix  his\nimagination on something. 'It must be a garden\nunder the window,' he thought. 'There's a sound\nof  trees.  How  I  dislike  the  sound  of  trees  on  a\nstormy night, in the dark! They give one a horrid\nfeeling.' He remembered how he had disliked it", "when he passed Petrovsky Park just now. This\nreminded him of the bridge over the Little Neva\nand he felt cold again as he had when standing\nthere.  'I  never  have  liked  water,'  he  thought,\n'even  in  a  landscape,'  and  he  suddenly  smiled\nagain  at  a  strange  idea:  'Surely  now  all  these\nquestions  of  taste  and  comfort  ought  not  to\nmatter, but I've become more particular, like an\nanimal that picks out a special place ... for such\nan  occasion.  I  ought  to  have  gone  into  the\nPetrovsky Park! I suppose it seemed dark, cold,\nha-ha!  As  though  I  were  seeking  pleasant\nsensations! ... By the way, why haven't I put out\nthe candle?' he blew it out. 'They've gone to bed\nnext  door,'  he  thought,  not  seeing  the  light  at\nthe  crack.  'Well,  now,  Marfa  Petrovna,  now  is\nthe  time  for  you  to  turn  up;  it's  dark,  and  the\nvery time and place for you. But now you won't\ncome!'\nHe  suddenly  recalled  how,  an  hour  before\ncarrying  out  his  design  on  Dounia,  he  had\nrecommended  Raskolnikov  to  trust  her  to\nRazumihin's keeping. 'I suppose I really did (cid:24)0(cid:24)\nCrime  and  Punishment  say  it,  as  Raskolnikov\nguessed, to tease myself. But what a rogue that\nRaskolnikov is! He's gone through a good deal.", "He  may  be  a  successful  rogue  in  time  when\nhe's  got  over  his  nonsense.  But  now  he's  too\neager  for  life.  These  young  men  are\ncontemptible on that point. But, hang the fellow!\nLet  him  please  himself,  it's  nothing  to  do  with\nme.'\nHe could not get to sleep. By degrees Dounia's\nimage rose before him, and a shudder ran over\nhim.  'No,  I  must  give  up  all  that  now,'  he\nthought,  rousing  himself.  'I  must  think  of\nsomething  else.  It's  queer  and  funny.  I  never\nhad  a  great  hatred  for  anyone,  I  never\nparticularly desired to avenge myself even, and\nthat's a bad sign, a bad sign, a bad sign. I never\nliked  quarrelling  either,  and  never  lost  my\ntemper- that's a bad sign too. And the promises\nI  made  her  just  now,  too-  Damnation!  But-who\nknows?-perhaps  she  would  have  made  a  new\nman of me somehow....'\nHe  ground  his  teeth  and  sank  into  silence\nagain.  Again  Dounia's  image  rose  before  him,\njust  as  she  was  when,  after  shooting  the  first\ntime, she had lowered the revolver in terror and\ngazed  blankly  at  him,  so  that  he  might  have\nseized  her  twice  over  and  she  would  not  have", "lifted  a  hand  to  defend  herself  if  he  had  not\nreminded her. He recalled how at that instant he\nfelt almost sorry for her, how he had felt a pang\nat his heart ...\n'Aïe!  Damnation,  these  thoughts  again!  I  must\nput it away!'\nHe  was  dozing  off;  the  feverish  shiver  had\nceased,  when  suddenly  something  seemed  to\nrun over his arm and leg under the bedclothes.\nHe  started.  'Ugh!  hang  it!  I  believe  0(cid:24)  it's  a\nmouse,' he thought, 'that's the veal I left on the\ntable.' He felt fearfully disinclined to pull off the\nblanket,  get  up,  get  cold,  but  all  at  once\nsomething  unpleasant  ran  over  his  leg  again.\nHe pulled off the blanket and lighted the candle.\nShaking  with  feverish  chill  he  bent  down  to\nexamine the bed: there was nothing. He shook\nthe  blanket  and  suddenly  a  mouse  jumped  out\non the sheet. He tried to catch it, but the mouse\nran  to  and  fro  in  zigzags  without  leaving  the\nbed,  slipped  between  his  fingers,  ran  over  his\nhand and suddenly darted under the pillow. He\nthrew  down  the  pillow,  but  in  one  instant  felt\nsomething  leap  on  his  chest  and  dart  over  his\nbody  and  down  his  back  under  his  shirt.  He", "trembled nervously and woke up.\nThe  room  was  dark.  He  was  lying  on  the  bed\nand  wrapped  up  in  the  blanket  as  before.  The\nwind  was  howling  under  the  window.  'How\ndisgusting,' he thought with annoyance.\nHe got up and sat on the edge of the bedstead\nwith  his  back  to  the  window.  'It's  better  not  to\nsleep  at  all,'  he  decided.  There  was  a  cold\ndamp  draught  from  the  window,  however;\nwithout getting up he drew the blanket over him\nand  wrapped  himself  in  it.  He  was  not  thinking\nof  anything  and  did  not  want  to  think.  But  one\nimage  rose  after  another,  incoherent  scraps  of\nthought  without  beginning  or  end  passed\nthrough  his  mind.  He  sank  into  drowsiness.\nPerhaps the cold, or the dampness, or the dark,\nor  the  wind  that  howled  under  the  window  and\ntossed  the  trees  roused  a  sort  of  persistent\ncraving  for  the  fantastic.  He  kept  dwelling  on\nimages of flowers, he fancied a charming flower\ngarden,  a  bright,  warm,  almost  hot  day,  a\nholiday-Trinity day. A (cid:24)0(cid:24) Crime and Punishment\nfine,  sumptuous  country  cottage  in  the  English\ntaste  overgrown  with  fragrant  flowers,  with\nflower  beds  going  round  the  house;  the  porch,", "wreathed  in  climbers,  was  surrounded  with\nbeds  of  roses.  A  light,  cool  staircase,  carpeted\nwith rich rugs, was decorated with rare plants in\nchina  pots.  He  noticed  particularly  in  the\nwindows  nosegays  of  tender,  white,  heavily\nfragrant  narcissus  bending  over  their  bright,\ngreen,  thick  long  stalks.  He  was  reluctant  to\nmove away from them, but he went up the stairs\nand  came  into  a  large,  high  drawing-room  and\nagain everywhere-at the windows, the doors on\nto  the  balcony,  and  on  the  balcony  itself-were\nflowers. The floors were strewn with freshly-cut\nfragrant  hay,  the  windows  were  open,  a  fresh,\ncool,  light  air  came  into  the  room.  The  birds\nwere  chirruping  under  the  window,  and  in  the\nmiddle  of  the  room,  on  a  table  covered  with  a\nwhite  satin  shroud,  stood  a  coffin.  The  coffin\nwas  covered  with  white  silk  and  edged  with  a\nthick white frill; wreaths of flowers surrounded it\non  all  sides.  Among  the  flowers  lay  a  girl  in  a\nwhite muslin dress, with her arms crossed and\npressed on her bosom, as though carved out of\nmarble.  But  her  loose  fair  hair  was  wet;  there\nwas  a  wreath  of  roses  on  her  head.  The  stern\nand  already  rigid  profile  of  her  face  looked  as\nthough chiselled of marble too, and the smile on\nher pale lips was full of an immense unchildish", "misery and sorrowful appeal. Svidrigaïlov knew\nthat  girl;  there  was  no  holy  image,  no  burning\ncandle  beside  the  coffin;  no  sound  of  prayers:\nthe  girl  had  drowned  herself.  She  was  only\nfourteen,  but  her  heart  was  broken.  And  she\nhad destroyed herself, crushed by an insult that\nhad appalled and amazed 0(cid:24) that childish soul,\nhad  smirched  that  angel  purity  with  unmerited\ndisgrace  and  torn  from  her  a  last  scream  of\ndespair, unheeded and brutally disregarded, on\na dark night in the cold and wet while the wind\nhowled....\nSvidrigaïlov  came  to  himself,  got  up  from  the\nbed  and  went  to  the  window.  He  felt  for  the\nlatch  and  opened  it.  The  wind  lashed  furiously\ninto  the  little  room  and  stung  his  face  and  his\nchest,  only  covered  with  his  shirt,  as  though\nwith  frost.  Under  the  window  there  must  have\nbeen something like a garden, and apparently a\npleasure  garden.  There,  too,  probably  there\nwere tea-tables and singing in the daytime. Now\ndrops  of  rain  flew  in  at  the  window  from  the\ntrees and bushes; it was dark as in a cellar, so\nthat  he  could  only  just  make  out  some  dark\nblurs of objects. Svidrigaïlov, bending down with\nelbows  on  the  window-sill,  gazed  for  five", "minutes  into  the  darkness;  the  boom  of  a\ncannon,  followed  by  a  second  one,  resounded\nin the darkness of the night. 'Ah, the signal! The\nriver  is  overflowing,'  he  thought.  'By  morning  it\nwill  be  swirling  down  the  street  in  the  lower\nparts,  flooding  the  basements  and  cellars.  The\ncellar  rats  will  swim  out,  and  men  will  curse  in\nthe rain and wind as they drag their rubbish to\ntheir  upper  storeys.  What  time  is  it  now?'  And\nhe  had  hardly  thought  it  when,  somewhere\nnear, a clock on the wall, ticking away hurriedly,\nstruck three.\n'Aha! It will be light in an hour! Why wait? I'll go\nout  at  once  straight  to  the  park.  I'll  choose  a\ngreat bush there drenched with rain, so that as\nsoon  as  one's  shoulder  touches  it,  millions  of\ndrops drip on one's head.'\nHe  moved  away  from  the  window,  shut  it,\nlighted  the  (cid:24)10  Crime  and  Punishment  candle,\nput  on  his  waistcoat,  his  overcoat  and  his  hat\nand  went  out,  carrying  the  candle,  into  the\npassage  to  look  for  the  ragged  attendant  who\nwould  be  asleep  somewhere  in  the  midst  of\ncandle-ends and all sorts of rubbish, to pay him\nfor  the  room  and  leave  the  hotel.  'It's  the  best", "minute; I couldn't choose a better.'\nHe walked for some time through a long narrow\ncorridor  without  finding  anyone  and  was  just\ngoing  to  call  out,  when  suddenly  in  a  dark\ncorner  between  an  old  cupboard  and  the  door\nhe  caught  sight  of  a  strange  object  which\nseemed  to  be  alive.  He  bent  down  with  the\ncandle  and  saw  a  little  girl,  not  more  than  five\nyears old, shivering and crying, with her clothes\nas wet as a soaking house-flannel. She did not\nseem  afraid  of  Svidrigaïlov,  but  looked  at  him\nwith  blank  amazement  out  of  her  big  black\neyes. Now and then she sobbed as children do\nwhen they have been crying a long time, but are\nbeginning to be comforted. The child's face was\npale  and  tired,  she  was  numb  with  cold.  'How\ncan  she  have  come  here?  She  must  have\nhidden  here  and  not  slept  all  night.'  He  began\nquestioning  her.  The  child  suddenly  becoming\nanimated,  chattered  away  in  her  baby\nlanguage,  something  about  'mammy'  and  that\n'mammy  would  beat  her,'  and  about  some  cup\nthat  she  had  'bwoken.'  The  child  chattered  on\nwithout  stopping.  He  could  only  guess  from\nwhat  she  said  that  she  was  a  neglected  child,\nwhose mother, probably a drunken cook, in the", "service  of  the  hotel,  whipped  and  frightened\nher;  that  the  child  had  broken  a  cup  of  her\nmother's  and  was  so  frightened  that  she  had\nrun away the evening before, had hidden for a\nlong while somewhere 11 outside in the rain, at\nlast  had  made  her  way  in  here,  hidden  behind\nthe  cupboard  and  spent  the  night  there,  crying\nand trembling from the damp, the darkness and\nthe  fear  that  she  would  be  badly  beaten  for  it.\nHe took her in his arms, went back to his room,\nsat her on the bed, and began undressing her.\nThe  torn  shoes  which  she  had  on  her\nstockingless  feet  were  as  wet  as  if  they  had\nbeen  standing  in  a  puddle  all  night.  When  he\nhad  undressed  her,  he  put  her  on  the  bed,\ncovered her up and wrapped her in the blanket\nfrom  her  head  downwards.  She  fell  asleep  at\nonce. Then he sank into dreary musing again.\n'What  folly  to  trouble  myself,'  he  decided\nsuddenly  with  an  oppressive  feeling  of\nannoyance.  'What  idiocy!'  In  vexation  he  took\nup  the  candle  to  go  and  look  for  the  ragged\nattendant  again  and  make  haste  to  go  away.\n'Damn  the  child!'  he  thought  as  he  opened  the\ndoor,  but  he  turned  again  to  see  whether  the\nchild  was  asleep.  He  raised  the  blanket", "carefully.  The  child  was  sleeping  soundly,  she\nhad  got  warm  under  the  blanket,  and  her  pale\ncheeks  were  flushed.  But  strange  to  say  that\nflush seemed brighter and coarser than the rosy\ncheeks  of  childhood.  'It's  a  flush  of  fever,'\nthought  Svidrigaïlov.  It  was  like  the  flush  from\ndrinking,  as  though  she  had  been  given  a  full\nglass  to  drink.  Her  crimson  lips  were  hot  and\nglowing;  but  what  was  this?  He  suddenly\nfancied  that  her  long  black  eyelashes  were\nquivering, as though the lids were opening and\na  sly  crafty  eye  peeped  out  with  an  unchildlike\nwink,  as  though  the  little  girl  were  not  asleep,\nbut pretending. Yes, it was so. Her lips parted in\na smile. The corners of her mouth quivered, as\nthough  she  were  trying  (cid:24)1(cid:24)  Crime  and\nPunishment to control them. But now she quite\ngave  up  all  effort,  now  it  was  a  grin,  a  broad\ngrin;  there  was  something  shameless,\nprovocative in that quite unchildish face; it was\ndepravity,  it  was  the  face  of  a  harlot,  the\nshameless  face  of  a  French  harlot.  Now  both\neyes  opened  wide;  they  turned  a  glowing,\nshameless  glance  upon  him;  they  laughed,\ninvited  him....  There  was  something  infinitely\nhideous  and  shocking  in  that  laugh,  in  those\neyes,  in  such  nastiness  in  the  face  of  a  child.", "'What,  at  five  years  old?'  Svidrigaïlov  muttered\nin  genuine  horror.  'What  does  it  mean?'  And\nnow she turned to him, her little face all aglow,\nholding  out  her  arms....  'Accursed  child!'\nSvidrigaïlov cried, raising his hand to strike her,\nbut at that moment he woke up.\nHe  was  in  the  same  bed,  still  wrapped  in  the\nblanket.  The  candle  had  not  been  lighted,  and\ndaylight was streaming in at the windows.\n'I've had nightmare all night!' He got up angrily,\nfeeling  utterly  shattered;  his  bones  ached.\nThere  was  a  thick  mist  outside  and  he  could\nsee nothing. It was nearly five. He had overslept\nhimself! He got up, put on his still damp jacket\nand overcoat. Feeling the revolver in his pocket,\nhe  took  it  out  and  then  he  sat  down,  took  a\nnotebook  out  of  his  pocket  and  in  the  most\nconspicuous place on the title page wrote a few\nlines  in  large  letters.  Reading  them  over,  he\nsank into thought with his elbows on the table.\nThe revolver and the notebook lay beside him.\nSome  flies  woke  up  and  settled  on  the\nuntouched veal, which was still on the table. He\nstared  at  them  and  at  last  with  his  free  right\nhand began trying to catch one. He tried till he", "was  tired,  but  could  not  catch  1(cid:24)  it.  At  last,\nrealising that he was engaged in this interesting\npursuit, he started, got up and walked resolutely\nout  of  the  room.  A  minute  later  he  was  in  the\nstreet.\nA  thick  milky  mist  hung  over  the  town.\nSvidrigaïlov walked  along  the  slippery  dirty \nwooden  pavement  towards the Little Neva. He\nwas  picturing  the  waters  of  the  Little  Neva\nswollen  in  the  night,  Petrovsky  Island,  the  wet\npaths, the wet grass, the wet trees and bushes\nand at last the bush.... He began ill-humouredly\nstaring  at  the  houses,  trying  to  think  of\nsomething  else.  There  was  not  a  cabman  or  a\npasser-by  in  the  street.  The  bright  yellow,\nwooden, little houses looked dirty and dejected\nwith  their  closed  shutters.  The  cold  and  damp\npenetrated  his  whole  body  and  he  began  to\nshiver. From time to time he came across shop\nsigns  and  read  each  carefully.  At  last  he\nreached  the  end  of  the  wooden  pavement  and\ncame  to  a  big  stone  house.  A  dirty,  shivering\ndog  crossed  his  path  with  its  tail  between  its\nlegs. A man in a greatcoat lay face downwards;\ndead drunk, across the pavement. He looked at\nhim and went on. A high tower stood up on the", "left.  'Bah!'  he  shouted,  'here  is  a  place.  Why\nshould  it  be  Petrovsky?  It  will  be  in  the\npresence of an official witness anyway....'\nHe  almost  smiled  at  this  new  thought  and\nturned  into  the  street  where  there  was  the  big\nhouse with the tower. At the great closed gates\nof  the  house,  a  little  man  stood  with  his\nshoulder  leaning  against  them,  wrapped  in  a\ngrey  soldier's  coat,  with  a  copper  Achilles\nhelmet  on  his  head.  He  cast  a  drowsy  and\nindifferent glance at Svidrigaïlov. His face wore\nthat  perpetual  look  of  peevish  dejection,  which\nis  so  sourly  (cid:24)1(cid:24)  Crime  and  Punishment  printed\non  all  faces  of  Jewish  race  without  exception.\nThey both, \nSvidrigaïlov  and  Achilles,  stared  at  each  other\nfor  a  few  minutes  without  speaking.  At  last  it\nstruck Achilles as irregular for a man not drunk\nto be standing three steps from him, staring and\nnot saying a word.\n'What  do  you  want  here?'  he  said,  without\nmoving or changing his position.\n'Nothing, brother, good morning,' answered ", "Svidrigaïlov.\n'This isn't the place.'\n'I am going to foreign parts, brother.'\n'To foreign parts?'\n'To America.'\n'America.'\nSvidrigaïlov took out the revolver and cocked it.\nAchilles raised his eyebrows.\n'I say, this is not the place for such jokes!'\n'Why shouldn't it be the place?'\n'Because it isn't.'\n'Well,  brother,  I  don't  mind  that.  It's  a  good\nplace.  When  you  are  asked,  you  just  say  he\nwas going, he said, to America.'\nHe put the revolver to his right temple.", "'You  can't  do  it  here,  it's  not  the  place,'  cried\nAchilles,  rousing  himself,  his  eyes  growing\nbigger and bigger.\nSvidrigaïlov pulled the trigger.1(cid:24) ", "#$#$Chapter 43#$#$\nThe  same  day,  about  seven  o'clock  in  the\nevening,  Raskolnikov  was  on  his  way  to  his\nmother's  and  sister's  lodging-the  lodging  in\nBakaleyev's house which Razumihin had found\nfor  them.  The  stairs  went  up  from  the  street.\nRaskolnikov  walked  with  lagging  steps,  as\nthough still hesitating whether to go or not. But\nnothing  would  have  turned  him  back:  his\ndecision was taken.\n'Besides,  it  doesn't  matter,  they  still  know\nnothing,'  he  thought,  'and  they  are  used  to\nthinking of me as eccentric.'\nHe  was  appallingly  dressed:  his  clothes  torn\nand  dirty,  soaked  with  a  night's  rain.  His  face\nwas almost distorted from fatigue, exposure, the\ninward  conflict  that  had  lasted  for  twenty-four\nhours.  He  had  spent  all  the  previous  night\nalone,  God  knows  where.  But  anyway  he  had\nreached a decision.\nHe  knocked  at  the  door  which  was  opened  by", "his mother. Dounia was not at home. Even the\nservant  happened  to  be  out.  At  first  Pulcheria\nAlexandrovna  was  speechless  with  joy  and\nsurprise;  then  she  took  him  by  the  hand  and\ndrew him into the room.\n'Here  you  are!'  she  began,  faltering  with  joy.\n'Don't be angry with me, Rodya, for welcoming\nyou  so  foolishly  with  tears:  I  am  laughing  not\ncrying.  Did  you  think  I  was  crying?  No,  I  am\ndelighted, but I've got into such a stupid habit of\n(cid:24)1(cid:24)  Crime  and  Punishment  shedding  tears.  I've\nbeen  like  that  ever  since  your  father's  death.  I\ncry  for  anything.  Sit  down,  dear  boy,  you  must\nbe tired; I see you are. Ah, how muddy you are.'\n'I  was  in  the  rain  yesterday,  mother....'\nRaskolnikov began.\n'No,  no,'  Pulcheria  Alexandrovna  hurriedly\ninterrupted,  'you  thought  I  was  going  to\ncross-question you in the womanish way I used\nto; don't be anxious, I understand, I understand\nit all: now I've learned the ways here and truly I\nsee for myself that they are better.

But,\nmy  goodness!  why  am  I  running  to  and  fro  as\nthough  I  were  crazy  ...  ?  I  am  reading  your\narticle in the magazine for the third time, Rodya.\nDmitri Prokofitch brought it to me. Directly I saw\nit  I  cried  out  to  myself:  'There,  foolish  one,'  I\nthought, 'that's what he is busy about; that's the\nsolution  of  the  mystery!  Learned  people  are\nalways like that. He may have some new ideas\nin  his  head  just  now;  he  is  thinking  them  over\nand  I  worry  him  and  upset  him.'  I  read  it,  my\ndear, and of course there was a great deal I did\nnot  understand;  but  that's  only  natural-how\nshould I?'\n'Show me, mother.'\nRaskolnikov  took  the  magazine  and  glanced \nat    his  article.  Incongruous  as  it  was  with  his\nmood  and  his  circumstances,  he  felt  that\nstrange and bitter sweet sensation 1(cid:24) that every\nauthor  experiences  the  first  time  he  sees\nhimself  in  print;  besides,  he  was  only\ntwenty-three.  It  lasted  only  a  moment.  After", "reading  a  few  lines  he  frowned  and  his  heart\nthrobbed  with  anguish.  He  recalled  all  the\ninward  conflict  of  the  preceding  months.  He\nflung  the  article  on  the  table  with  disgust  and\nanger.\n'But,  however  foolish  I  may  be,  Rodya,  I  can\nsee for myself that you will very soon be one of\nthe  leading-if  not  the  leading  man-in  the  world\nof Russian thought.

And  Dounia,\nDounia was all but believing it-what do you say\nto that? Your father sent twice to magazines-the\nfirst time poems (I've got the manuscript and will\nshow you) and the second time a whole novel (I\nbegged him to let me copy it out) and how we\nprayed that they should be taken-they weren't! I\nwas  breaking  my  heart,  Rodya,  six  or  seven\ndays  ago  over  your  food  and  your  clothes  and\nthe way you are living. But now I see again how\nfoolish I was, for you can attain any position you\nlike  by  your  intellect  and  talent.  No  doubt  you\ndon't  care  about  that  for  the  present  and  you\nare  occupied  with  much  more  important\nmatters....'", "'Dounia's not at home, mother?'\n'No, Rodya. I often don't see her; she leaves me\nalone. Dmitri Prokofitch comes to see me, it's so\ngood of him, and he always talks about you. He\nloves  you  and  respects  you,  my  dear.  I  don't\nsay  that  Dounia  is  very  wanting  in\nconsideration.  I  am  not  complaining.  She  has\nher ways and I have (cid:24)1(cid:24) Crime and Punishment\nmine;  she  seems  to  have  got  some  secrets  of\nlate and I never have any secrets from you two.\nOf  course,  I  am  sure  that  Dounia  has  far  too\nmuch  sense,  and  besides  she  loves  you  and\nme  ...  but  I  don't  know  what  it  will  all  lead  to.\nYou've  made  me  so  happy  by  coming  now,\nRodya,  but  she  has  missed  you  by  going  out;\nwhen  she  comes  in  I'll  tell  her:  'Your  brother\ncame  in  while  you  were  out.  Where  have  you\nbeen  all  this  time?'  You  mustn't  spoil  me,\nRodya,  you  know;  come  when  you  can,  but  if\nyou  can't,  it  doesn't  matter,  I  can  wait.  I  shall\nknow, anyway, that you are fond of me, that will\nbe enough for me. I shall read what you write, I\nshall  hear  about  you  from  everyone,  and\nsometimes  you'll  come  yourself  to  see  me.\nWhat could be better? Here you've come now to", "comfort your mother, I see that.'\nHere Pulcheria Alexandrovna began to cry.\n'Here  I  am  again!  Don't  mind  my  foolishness.\nMy goodness, why am I sitting here?' she cried,\njumping  up.  'There  is  coffee  and  I  don't  offer\nyou any. Ah, that's the selfishness of old age. I'll\nget it at once!'\n'Mother,  don't  trouble,  I  am  going  at  once.  I\nhaven't come for that. Please listen to me.'\nPulcheria Alexandrovna went up to him timidly.\n'Mother, whatever happens, whatever you hear\nabout me, whatever you are told about me, will\nyou always love me as you do now?' he asked\nsuddenly  from  the  fullness  of  his  heart,  as\nthough  not  thinking  of  his  words  and  not\nweighing them.\n'Rodya,  Rodya,  what  is  the  matter?  How  can\nyou ask me such a question? Why, who will tell\nme anything about you? 1(cid:24) Besides, I shouldn't\nbelieve anyone, I should refuse to listen.'", "'I've come to assure you that I've always loved\nyou and I am glad that we are alone, even glad\nDounia  is  out,'  he  went  on  with  the  same\nimpulse.  'I  have  come  to  tell  you  that  though\nyou will be unhappy, you must believe that your\nson loves you now more than himself, and that\nall  you  thought  about  me,  that  I  was  cruel  and\ndidn't care about you, was all a mistake. I shall\nnever cease to love you.... Well, that's enough: I\nthought I must do this and begin with this....'\nPulcheria  Alexandrovna  embraced  him  in\nsilence,  pressing  him  to  her  bosom  and\nweeping gently.\n'I  don't  know  what  is  wrong  with  you,  Rodya,'\nshe said at last. 'I've been thinking all this time\nthat  we  were  simply  boring  you  and  now  I  see\nthat there is a great sorrow in store for you, and\nthat's why you are miserable. I've foreseen it a\nlong  time,  Rodya.  Forgive  me  for  speaking\nabout  it.  I  keep  thinking  about  it  and  lie  awake\nat nights. Your sister lay talking in her sleep all\nlast  night,  talking  of  nothing  but  you.  I  caught\nsomething,  but  I  couldn't  make  it  out.

Oh,  God,  what  are  we", "doing?'\nYes,  he  was  glad,  he  was  very  glad  that  there\nwas  no  one  there,  that  he  was  alone  with  his\nmother.  For  the  first  time  after  all  those  awful\nmonths  his  heart  was  softened.  He  fell  down\nbefore  her,  he  kissed  her  feet  and  both  wept,\nembracing. And she was not surprised and did\nnot question him this time. For some days she\nhad  realised  that  something  awful  was\nhappening  to  her  son  and  that  now  some\nterrible minute had come for him.\n'Rodya,  my  darling,  my  first  born,'  she  said\nsobbing,  'now  you  are  just  as  when  you  were\nlittle. You would run like this to me and hug me\nand  kiss  me.  When  your  father  was  living  and\nwe  were  poor,  you  comforted  us  simply  by\nbeing  with  us  and  when  I  buried  your  father,\nhow  often  we  wept  together  at  his  grave  and\nembraced,  as  now.  And  if  I've  been  crying\nlately,  it's  that  my  mother's  heart  had  a\nforeboding  of  trouble.  The  first  time  I  saw  you,\nthat  evening,  you  remember,  as  soon  as  we\narrived here, I guessed simply from your eyes.\nMy  heart  sank  at  once,  and  to-day  when  I\nopened  the  door  and  looked  at  you,  I  thought", "the fatal hour had come.

Only  say  two  words  to\nme-is it far where you are going?'\n'Very far.'\n'What  is  awaiting  you  there?  Some  post  or\ncareer for you?'\n'What  God  sends  ...  only  pray  for  me.'\nRaskolnikov went to the door, but she clutched\nhim  and  gazed  despairingly  into  his  eyes.  Her\nface worked with terror.\n'Enough,  mother,'  said  Raskolnikov,  deeply\nregretting that he had come.\n'Not for ever, it's not yet for ever? You'll come,\nyou'll come to-morrow?'", "'I will, I will, good-bye.' He tore himself away at\nlast.\nIt  was  a  warm,  fresh,  bright  evening;  it  had\ncleared up in the morning. Raskolnikov went to\nhis  lodgings;  he  made  haste.  He  wanted  to\nfinish all before sunset. He did not want to meet\nanyone till then. Going up the stairs he noticed\nthat  Nastasya  rushed  from  the  samovar  to\nwatch  him  intently.  'Can  anyone  have  come  to\nsee  me?'  he  wondered.  He  had  a  disgusted\nvision  of  Porfiry.  But  opening  his  door  he  saw\nDounia. She was sitting alone, plunged in deep\nthought,  and  looked  as  though  she  had  been\nwaiting  a  long  time.  He  stopped  short  in  the\ndoorway. She rose from the sofa in dismay and\nstood up facing him. Her eyes, fixed upon him, (cid:24)\nbetrayed  horror  and  infinite  grief.  And  from\nthose eyes alone he saw at once that she knew.\n'Am  I  to  come  in  or  go  away?'  he  asked\nuncertainly.\n'I've  been  all  day  with  Sofya  Semyonovna.  We\nwere both waiting for you. We thought that you\nwould be sure to come there.'", "Raskolnikov  went  into  the  room  and  sank\nexhausted on a chair.\n'I  feel  weak,  Dounia,  I  am  very  tired;  and  I\nshould have liked at this moment to be able to\ncontrol myself.'\nHe glanced at her mistrustfully.\n'Where were you all night?'\n'I  don't  remember  clearly.  You  see,  sister,  I\nwanted  to  make  up  my  mind  once  for  all,  and\nseveral times I walked by the Neva, I remember\nthat I wanted to end it all there, but ... I couldn't\nmake up my mind,' he whispered, looking at her\nmistrustfully again.\n'Thank God! That was just what we were afraid\nof,  Sofya  Semyonovna  and  I.  Then  you  still\nhave faith in life? Thank God, thank God!'\nRaskolnikov smiled bitterly.\n'I haven't faith, but I have just been weeping in\nmother's  arms;  I  haven't  faith,  but  I  have  just\nasked her to pray for me. I don't know how it is,", "Dounia, I don't understand it.'\n'Have  you  been  at  mother's?  Have  you  told\nher?' cried Dounia, horror- stricken. 'Surely you\nhaven't done that?'\n'No,  I  didn't  tell  her  ...  in  words;  but  she\nunderstood a great deal. She heard you talking\nin your sleep. I am sure she half understands it\nalready. Perhaps I did wrong in go-(cid:24)(cid:24) ing to see\nher.  I  don't  know  why  I  did  go.  I  am  a\ncontemptible person, Dounia.'\n'A  contemptible  person,  but  ready  to  face\nsuffering! You are, aren't you?'\n'Yes,  I  am  going.  At  once.  Yes,  to  escape  the\ndisgrace  I  thought  of  drowning  myself,  Dounia,\nbut as I looked into the water, I thought that if I\nhad considered myself strong till now I'd better\nnot be afraid of disgrace,' he said, hurrying on.\n'It's pride, Dounia.'\n'Pride, Rodya.'\nThere was a gleam of fire in his lustreless eyes;\nhe seemed to be glad to think that he was still", "proud.\n'You don't think, sister, that I was simply afraid\nof  the  water?'  he  asked,  looking  into  her  face\nwith a sinister smile.\n'Oh, Rodya, hush!' cried Dounia bitterly. Silence\nlasted  for  two  minutes.  He  sat  with  his  eyes\nfixed on the floor; Dounia stood at the other end\nof  the  table  and  looked  at  him  with  anguish.\nSuddenly he got up.\n'It's  late,  it's  time  to  go!  I  am  going  at  once  to\ngive myself up. But I don't know why I am going\nto give myself up.'\nBig tears fell down her cheeks.\n'You  are  crying,  sister,  but  can  you  hold  out\nyour hand to me?'\n'You doubted it?'\nShe threw her arms round him.\n'Aren't  you  half  expiating  your  crime  by  facing\nthe suffering?' she cried, holding him close and", "kissing him.\n'Crime?  What  crime?'  he  cried  in  sudden  fury.\n'That  I  killed  a  vile  noxious  insect,  an  old\npawnbroker  woman,  of  (cid:24)  use  to  no  one!  ...\nKilling  her  was  atonement  for  forty  sins.  She\nwas  sucking  the  life  out  of  poor  people.  Was\nthat a crime? I am not thinking of it and I am not\nthinking  of  expiating  it,  and  why  are  you  all\nrubbing  it  in  on  all  sides?  'A  crime!  a  crime!'\nOnly  now  I  see  clearly  the  imbecility  of  my\ncowardice, now that I have decided to face this\nsuperfluous  disgrace.  It's  simply  because  I  am\ncontemptible and have nothing in me that I have\ndecided  to,  perhaps  too  for  my  advantage,  as\nthat ... Porfiry ... suggested!'\n'Brother,  brother,  what  are  you  saying?  Why,\nyou have shed blood?' cried Dounia in despair.\n'Which  all  men  shed,'  he  put  in  almost\nfrantically,  'which  flows  and  has  always  flowed\nin  streams,  which  is  spilt  like  champagne,  and\nfor  which  men  are  crowned  in  the  Capitol  and\nare  called  afterwards  benefactors  of  mankind.\nLook  into  it  more  carefully  and  understand  it!  I\ntoo wanted to do good to men and would have", "done  hundreds,  thousands  of  good  deeds  to\nmake  up  for  that  one  piece  of  stupidity,  not\nstupidity  even,  simply  clumsiness,  for  the  idea\nwas  by  no  means  so  stupid  as  it  seems  now\nthat  it  has  failed....  (Everything  seems  stupid\nwhen it fails.) By that stupidity I only wanted to\nput myself into an independent position, to take\nthe  first  step,  to  obtain  means,  and  then\neverything would have been smoothed over by\nbenefits immeasurable in comparison.... But I ...\nI couldn't carry out even the first step, because I\nam  contemptible,  that's  what's  the  matter!  And\nyet  I  won't  look  at  it  as  you  do.  If  I  had\nsucceeded  I  should  have  been  crowned  with\nglory, but now I'm trapped.'\n'But that's not so, not so! Brother, what are you\nsaying?'(cid:24)(cid:24)  'Ah,  it's  not  picturesque,  not\næsthetically  attractive!  I  fail  to  understand  why\nbombarding  people  by  regular  siege  is  more\nhonourable. The fear of appearances is the first\nsymptom  of  impotence.  I've  never,  never\nrecognised this more clearly than now, and I am\nfurther  than  ever  from  seeing  that  what  I  did\nwas  a  crime.  I've  never,  never  been  stronger\nand more convinced than now.'", "The colour had rushed into his pale exhausted\nface, but as he uttered his last explanation, he\nhappened  to  meet  Dounia's  eyes  and  he  saw\nsuch  anguish  in  them  that  he  could  not  help\nbeing  checked.  He  felt  that  he  had,  anyway,\nmade these two poor women miserable, that he\nwas, anyway, the cause ...\n'Dounia darling, if I am guilty forgive me (though\nI  cannot  be  forgiven  if  I  am  guilty).  Good-bye!\nWe  won't  dispute.  It's  time,  high  time  to  go.\nDon't  follow  me,  I  beseech  you,  I  have\nsomewhere  else  to  go....  But  you  go  at  once\nand sit with mother. I entreat you to! It's my last\nrequest of you. Don't leave her at all; I left her in\na state of anxiety, that she is not fit to bear; she\nwill  die  or  go  out  of  her  mind.  Be  with  her!\nRazumihin will be with you. I've been talking to\nhim....  Don't  cry  about  me:  I'll  try  to  be  honest\nand manly all my life, even if I am a murderer.\nPerhaps I shall some day make a name. I won't\ndisgrace you, you will see; I'll still show.... Now\ngood-bye  for  the  present,'  he  concluded\nhurriedly, noticing again a strange expression in\nDounia's  eyes  at  his  last  words  and  promises.\n'Why  are  you  crying?  Don't  cry,  don't  cry:  we\nare not parting for ever! Ah, yes! Wait a minute,", "I'd  forgotten!'(cid:24)  He  went  to  the  table,  took  up  a\nthick  dusty  book,  opened  it  and  took  from\nbetween  the  pages  a  little  water-colour  portrait\non  ivory.  It  was  the  portrait  of  his  landlady's\ndaughter,  who  had  died  of  fever,  that  strange\ngirl who had wanted to be a nun. For a minute\nhe gazed at the delicate expressive face of his\nbetrothed,  kissed  the  portrait  and  gave  it  to\nDounia.\n'I used to talk a great deal about it to her, only to\nher,'  he  said  thoughtfully.  'To  her  heart  I\nconfided  much  of  what  has  since  been  so\nhideously  realised.  Don't  be  uneasy,'  he\nreturned to Dounia, 'she was as much opposed\nto it as you, and I am glad that she is gone. The\ngreat point is that everything now is going to be\ndifferent, is going to be broken in two,' he cried,\nsuddenly returning to his dejection. 'Everything,\neverything, and am I prepared for it? Do I want\nit  myself?  They  say  it  is  necessary  for  me  to\nsuffer!  What's  the  object  of  these  senseless\nsufferings?  shall  I  know  any  better  what  they\nare  for,  when  I  am  crushed  by  hardships  and\nidiocy,  and  weak  as  an  old  man  after  twenty\nyears' penal servitude? And what shall I have to\nlive  for  then?  Why  am  I  consenting  to  that  life", "now?  Oh,  I  knew  I  was  contemptible  when  I\nstood looking at the Neva at daybreak to-day!'\nAt  last  they  both  went  out.  It  was  hard  for\nDounia,  but  she  loved  him.  She  walked  away,\nbut  after  going  fifty  paces  she  turned  round  to\nlook  at  him  again.  He  was  still  in  sight.  At  the\ncorner he too turned and for the last time their\neyes  met;  but  noticing  that  she  was  looking  at\nhim, he motioned her away with impatience and\neven vexation, and turned the corner abruptly.(cid:24)(cid:24)\n'I am wicked, I see that,' he thought to himself,\nfeeling  ashamed  a  moment  later  of  his  angry\ngesture to Dounia. 'But why are they so fond of\nme if I don't deserve it? Oh, if only I were alone\nand no one loved me and I too had never loved\nanyone!  Nothing  of  all  this  would  have\nhappened.  But  I  wonder  shall  I  in  those  fifteen\nor  twenty  years  grow  so  meek  that  I  shall\nhumble  myself  before  people  and  whimper  at\nevery  word  that  I  am  a  criminal?  Yes,  that's  it,\nthat's  it,  that's  what  they  are  sending  me  there\nfor, that's what they want. Look at them running\nto and fro about the streets, every one of them\na scoundrel and a criminal at heart and, worse\nstill, an idiot. But try to get me off and they'd be\nwild  with  righteous  indignation.  Oh,  how  I  hate", "them all!'\nHe fell to musing by what process it could come\nto pass, that he could be humbled before all of\nthem,  indiscriminately-humbled  by  conviction.\nAnd  yet  why  not?  It  must  be  so.  Would  not\ntwenty  years  of  continual  bondage  crush  him\nutterly? Water wears out a stone. And why, why\nshould he live after that? Why should he go now\nwhen  he  knew  that  it  would  be  so?  It  was  the\nhundredth  time  perhaps  that  he  had  asked\nhimself  that  question  since  the  previous\nevening, but still he went.(cid:24) ", "#$#$Chapter 44#$#$\nWhen he went into Sonia's room, it was already\ngetting \ndark. All day Sonia had been waiting for him in\nterrible  anxiety.  Dounia  had  been  waiting  with\nher.  She  had  come  to  her  that    morning,\nremembering  Svidrigaïlov's  words  that  Sonia\nknew.  We  will  not  describe  the  conversation\nand tears of the two girls, and how friendly they\nbecame.  Dounia  gained  one  comfort  at  least\nfrom  that  interview,  that  her  brother  would  not\nbe alone. He had gone to her, Sonia, first with\nhis  confession;  he  had  gone  to  her  for  human\nfellowship  when  he  needed  it;  she  would  go\nwith him wherever fate might send him. Dounia\ndid not ask, but she knew it was so. She looked\nat  Sonia  almost  with  reverence  and  at  first\nalmost embarrassed her by it. Sonia was almost\non  the  point  of  tears.  She  felt  herself,  on  the\ncontrary,  hardly  worthy  to  look  at  Dounia.\nDounia's gracious image when she had bowed\nto her so attentively and respectfully at their first\nmeeting in Raskolnikov's room had remained in", "her mind as one of the fairest visions of her life.\nDounia  at  last  became  impatient  and,  leaving\nSonia, went to her brother's room to await him\nthere;  she  kept  thinking  that  he  would  come\nthere first. When she had gone, Sonia began to\nbe  tortured  by  the  dread  of  his  committing\nsuicide, and Dounia too feared it. But they had\nspent the day trying to persuade each other that\nthat could not be, and both were (cid:24)(cid:24) less anxious\nwhile  they  were  together.  As  soon  as  they\nparted,  each  thought  of  nothing  else.  Sonia\nremembered  how  Svidrigaïlov  had  said  to  her\nthe  day  before  that  Raskolnikov  had  two\nalternatives-Siberia or ... Besides she knew his\nvanity, his pride and his lack of faith.\n'Is it possible that he has nothing but cowardice\nand fear of death to make him live?' she thought\nat last in despair.\nMeanwhile  the  sun  was  setting.  Sonia  was\nstanding in dejection, looking intently out of the\nwindow,  but  from  it  she  could  see  nothing  but\nthe  unwhitewashed  blank  wall  of  the  next\nhouse.  At  last  when  she  began  to  feel  sure  of\nhis death-he walked into the room.", "She gave a cry of joy, but looking carefully into\nhis face she turned pale.\n'Yes,'  said  Raskolnikov,  smiling.  'I  have  come\nfor your cross, Sonia. It was you told me to go\nto the cross-roads; why is it you are frightened\nnow it's come to that?'\nSonia  gazed  at  him  astonished.  His  tone\nseemed  strange  to  her;  a  cold  shiver  ran  over\nher, but in a moment she guessed that the tone\nand  the  words  were  a  mask.  He  spoke  to  her\nlooking  away,  as  though  to  avoid  meeting  her\neyes.\n'You  see,  Sonia,  I've  decided  that  it  will  be\nbetter  so.  There  is  one  fact....  But  it's  a  long\nstory  and  there's  no  need  to  discuss  it.  But  do\nyou  know  what  angers  me?  It  annoys  me  that\nall  those  stupid  brutish  faces  will  be  gaping  at\nme  directly,  pestering  me  with  their  stupid\nquestions,  which  I  shall  have  to  answer-they'll\npoint their fingers at me.... Tfoo! You know I am\nnot going to Porfiry, I am sick of him. I'd rather\ngo  to  my  friend,  the  Explosive  Lieutenant;  how\n(cid:24)(cid:24)0  Crime  and  Punishment  I  shall  surprise  him,", "what  a  sensation  I  shall  make!  But  I  must  be\ncooler;  I've  become  too  irritable  of  late.  You\nknow  I  was  nearly  shaking  my  fist  at  my  sister\njust now, because she turned to take a last look\nat me. It's a brutal state to be in! Ah! what am I\ncoming to! Well, where are the crosses?'\nHe seemed hardly to know what he was doing.\nHe  could  not  stay  still  or  concentrate  his\nattention  on  anything;  his  ideas  seemed  to\ngallop after one another, he talked incoherently,\nhis hands trembled slightly.\nWithout a word Sonia took out of the drawer two\ncrosses,  one  of  cypress  wood  and  one  of\ncopper.  She  made  the  sign  of  the  cross  over\nherself and over him, and put the wooden cross\non his neck.\n'It's  the  symbol  of  my  taking  up  the  cross,'  he\nlaughed. 'As though I had not suffered much till\nnow!  The  wooden  cross,  that  is  the  peasant\none;  the  copper  one,  that  is  Lizaveta's-you  will\nwear yourself, show me! So she had it on ... at\nthat moment? I remember two things like these\ntoo,  a  silver  one  and  a  little  ikon.  I  threw  them\nback on the old woman's neck. Those would be", "appropriate now, really, those are what I ought\nto put on now.... But I am talking nonsense and\nforgetting  what  matters;  I'm  somehow\nforgetful....  You  see  I  have  come  to  warn  you,\nSonia,  so  that  you  might  know  ...  that's  all-\nthat's all I came for. But I thought I had more to\nsay. You wanted me to go yourself. Well, now I\nam  going  to  prison  and  you'll  have  your  wish.\nWell,  what  are  you  crying  for?  You  too?  Don't.\nLeave off! Oh, how I hate it all!'\nBut his feeling was stirred; his heart ached, as\nhe looked at her. 'Why is she grieving too?' he\nthought  to  himself.  (cid:24)1  'What  am  I  to  her?  Why\ndoes  she  weep?  Why  is  she  looking  after  me,\nlike my mother or Dounia? She'll be my nurse.'\n'Cross yourself, say at least one prayer,' Sonia\nbegged in a timid broken voice.\n'Oh  certainly,  as  much  as  you  like!  And\nsincerely, Sonia, sincerely....'\nBut he wanted to say something quite different.\nHe  crossed  himself  several  times.  Sonia  took\nup  her  shawl  and  put  it  over  her  head.  It  was", "the  green  drap  de  dames  shawl  of  which\nMarmeladov  had  spoken,  'the  family  shawl.'\nRaskolnikov thought of that looking at it, but he\ndid  not  ask.  He  began  to  feel  himself  that  he\nwas  certainly  forgetting  things  and  was\ndisgustingly agitated. He was frightened at this.\nHe was suddenly struck too by the thought that\nSonia meant to go with him.\n'What  are  you  doing?  Where  are  you  going?\nStay  here,  stay!  I'll  go  alone,'  he  cried  in\ncowardly  vexation,  and  almost  resentful,  he\nmoved  towards  the  door.  'What's  the  use  of\ngoing in procession?' he muttered going out.\nSonia  remained  standing  in  the  middle  of  the\nroom. He had not even said good-bye to her; he\nhad  forgotten  her.  A  poignant  and  rebellious\ndoubt surged in his heart.\n'Was  it  right,  was  it  right,  all  this?'  he  thought\nagain  as  he  went  down  the  stairs.  'Couldn't  he\nstop and retract it all ... and not go?'\nBut  still  he  went.  He  felt  suddenly  once  for  all\nthat  he  mustn't  ask  himself  questions.  As  he\nturned  into  the  street  he  remembered  that  he", "had not said good-bye to Sonia, that he had left\nher  in  the  middle  of  the  room  in  her  green\nshawl, (cid:24) not daring to stir after he had shouted\nat  her,  and  he  stopped  short  for  a  moment.  At\nthe same instant, another thought dawned upon\nhim, as though it had been lying in wait to strike\nhim then.\n'Why, with what object did I go to her just now? I\ntold  her-on  business;  on  what  business?  I  had\nno sort of business! To tell her I was going; but\nwhere  was  the  need?  Do  I  love  her?  No,  no,  I\ndrove her away just now like a dog. Did I want\nher  crosses?  Oh,  how  low  I've  sunk!  No,  I\nwanted her tears, I wanted to see her terror, to\nsee  how  her  heart  ached!  I  had  to  have\nsomething  to  cling  to,  something  to  delay  me,\nsome  friendly  face  to  see!  And  I  dared  to\nbelieve in myself, to dream of what I would do! I\nam  a  beggarly  contemptible  wretch,\ncontemptible!'\nHe  walked  along  the  canal  bank,  and  he  had\nnot  much  further  to  go.  But  on  reaching  the\nbridge  he  stopped  and  turning  out  of  his  way\nalong it went to the Hay Market.", "He  looked  eagerly  to  right  and  left,  gazed\nintently  at  every  object  and  could  not  fix  his\nattention on anything; everything slipped away.\n'In  another  week,  another  month  I  shall  be\ndriven  in  a  prison  van  over  this  bridge,  how\nshall  I  look  at  the  canal  then?  I  should  like  to\nremember  this!'  slipped  into  his  mind.  'Look  at\nthis  sign!  How  shall  I  read  those  letters  then?\nIt's  written  here  'Campany,'  that's  a  thing  to\nremember, that letter a and to look at it again in\na month-how shall I look at it then? What shall I\nbe feeling and thinking then? ... How trivial it all\nmust  be,  what  I  am  fretting  about  now!  Of\ncourse it must all be interesting ... in its way ...\n(Ha-ha-ha!  What  am  I  thinking  about?)  (cid:24)(cid:24)  I  am\nbecoming  a  baby,  I  am  showing  off  to  myself;\nwhy  am  I  ashamed?  Foo!  how  people  shove!\nthat fat man-a German he must be-who pushed\nagainst  me,  does  he  know  whom  he  pushed?\nThere's a peasant woman with a baby, begging.\nIt's curious that she thinks me happier than she\nis.  I  might  give  her  something,  for  the\nincongruity of it. Here's a five copeck piece left\nin my pocket, where did I get it? Here, here ...\ntake it, my good woman!'\n'God  bless  you,'  the  beggar  chanted  in  a", "lachrymose voice.\nHe went into the Hay Market. It was distasteful,\nvery distasteful to be in a crowd, but he walked\njust where he saw most people. He would have\ngiven anything in the world to be alone; but he\nknew himself that he would not have remained\nalone  for  a  moment.  There  was  a  man  drunk\nand  disorderly  in  the  crowd;  he  kept  trying  to\ndance and falling down. There was a ring round\nhim. Raskolnikov squeezed his way through the\ncrowd, stared for some minutes at the drunken\nman  and  suddenly  gave  a  short  jerky  laugh.  A\nminute  later  he  had  forgotten  him  and  did  not\nsee him, though he still stared. He moved away\nat  last,  not  remembering  where  he  was;  but\nwhen  he  got  into  the  middle  of  the  square  an\nemotion  suddenly  came  over  him,\noverwhelming him body and mind.\nHe suddenly recalled Sonia's words, 'Go to the\ncrossroads,  bow  down  to  the  people,  kiss  the\nearth,  for  you  have  sinned  against  it  too,  and\nsay aloud to the whole world, 'I am a murderer.''\nHe  trembled,  remembering  that.  And  the\nhopeless  misery  and  anxiety  of  all  that  time,\nespecial(cid:24)  ly  of  the  last  hours,  had  weighed  so", "heavily  upon  him  that  he  positively  clutched  at\nthe  chance  of  this  new  unmixed,  complete\nsensation. It came over him like a fit; it was like\na single spark kindled in his soul and spreading\nfire  through  him.  Everything  in  him  softened  at\nonce and the tears started into his eyes. He fell\nto the earth on the spot....\nHe  knelt  down  in  the  middle  of  the  square,\nbowed down to the earth, and kissed that filthy\nearth  with  bliss  and  rapture.  He  got  up  and\nbowed down a second time.\n'He's boozed,' a youth near him observed.\nThere was a roar of laughter.\n'He's  going  to  Jerusalem,  brothers,  and  saying\ngood-bye  to  his  children  and  his  country.  He's\nbowing  down  to  all  the  world  and  kissing  the\ngreat  city  of  St.  Petersburg  and  its  pavement,'\nadded a workman who was a little drunk.\n'Quite a young man, too!' observed a third.\n'And a gentleman,' someone observed soberly.", "'There's  no  knowing  who's  a  gentleman  and\nwho isn't nowadays.'\nThese  exclamations  and  remarks  checked\nRaskolnikov, and the words, 'I am a murderer,'\nwhich  were  perhaps  on  the  point  of  dropping\nfrom  his  lips,  died  away.  He  bore  these \nremarks    quietly,    however,    and,    without \nlooking round, he turned down a street leading\nto  the  police  office.  He  had  a  glimpse  of\nsomething  on  the  way  which  did  not  surprise\nhim; he had felt that it must be so. The second\ntime he bowed down in the Hay Market he saw,\nstanding fifty paces from him on the left, Sonia.\nShe  was  hiding  from  him  behind  one  of  the\nwooden  shanties  in  the  market-place.  She  (cid:24)(cid:24)\nhad  followed  him  then  on  his  painful  way!\nRaskolnikov at that moment felt and knew once\nfor  all  that  Sonia  was  with  him  for  ever  and\nwould  follow  him  to  the  ends  of  the  earth,\nwherever fate might take him. It wrung his heart\n... but he was just reaching the fatal place.\nHe went into the yard fairly resolutely. He had to\nmount to the third storey. 'I shall be some time\ngoing  up,'  he  thought.  He  felt  as  though  the\nfateful  moment  was  still  far  off,  as  though  he", "had plenty of time left for consideration.\nAgain  the  same  rubbish,  the  same  eggshells\nlying about on the spiral stairs, again the open\ndoors of the flats, again the same kitchens and\nthe same fumes and stench coming from them.\nRaskolnikov had not been here since that day.\nHis  legs  were  numb  and  gave  way  under  him,\nbut  still  they  moved  forward.  He  stopped  for  a\nmoment to take breath, to collect himself, so as\nto  enter  like  a  man.  'But  why?  what  for?'  he\nwondered,  reflecting.  'If  I  must  drink  the  cup\nwhat  difference  does  it  make?  The  more\nrevolting the better.' He imagined for an instant\nthe  figure  of  the  'explosive  lieutenant,'  Ilya\nPetrovitch.  Was  he  actually  going  to  him?\nCouldn't  he  go  to  someone  else?  To  Nikodim\nFomitch? Couldn't he turn back and go straight\nto  Nikodim  Fomitch's  lodgings?  At  least  then  it\nwould  be  done  privately....  No,  no!  To  the\n'explosive lieutenant'! If he must drink it, drink it\noff at once.\nTurning  cold  and  hardly  conscious,  he  opened\nthe  door  of  the  office.  There  were  very  few\npeople in it this time-only a house porter and a\npeasant. The doorkeeper did not even peep out", "from  behind  his  screen.  Raskolnikov  walked\ninto  the  next  room.  'Perhaps  I  still  need  not\nspeak,' passed (cid:24) through his mind. Some sort of\nclerk not wearing a uniform was settling himself\nat  a  bureau  to  write.  In  a  corner  another  clerk\nwas  seating  himself.  Zametov  was  not  there,\nnor, of course, Nikodim Fomitch.\n'No one in?' Raskolnikov asked, addressing the\nperson at the bureau.\n'Whom do you want?'\n'A-ah! Not a sound was heard, not a sight was\nseen, but I scent the Russian ... how does it go\non  in  the  fairy  tale  ...  I've  forgotten!  'At  your\nservice!'' a familiar voice cried suddenly.\nRaskolnikov  shuddered.  The  Explosive\nLieutenant stood before him. He had just come\nin  from  the  third  room.  'It  is  the  hand  of  fate,'\nthought Raskolnikov. 'Why is he here?'\n'You've come to see us? What about?' cried Ilya\nPetrovitch. He was obviously in an exceedingly\ngood humour and perhaps a trifle exhilarated. 'If\nit's on business you are rather early.[*] It's only", "a chance that I am here ... however I'll do what I\ncan.  I  must  admit,  I  ...  what  is  it,  what  is  it?\nExcuse me....'\n[*] Dostoevsky appears to have forgotten that it\nis  after  sunset,  and  that  the  last  time\nRaskolnikov  visited  the  police  office  at  two  in\nthe afternoon he was reproached for coming too\nlate.-TRANSLATOR.'Raskolnikov.'\n'Of  course,  Raskolnikov.

He  is  a\nfeather-headed  youngster,  that's  all;  one  might\nhave  expected  something  from  him,  but  there,\nyou  know  what  they  are,  our  brilliant  young\nmen. He wanted to go in for some examination,\nbut it's only to talk and boast about it, it will go\nno  further  than  that.  Of  course  it's  a  very\ndifferent  matter  with  you  or  Mr.  Razumihin\nthere, your friend. Your career is an intellectual\none  and  you  won't  be  deterred  by  failure.  For\nyou, one may say, all the attractions of life nihil\nest-you  are  an  ascetic,  a  monk,  a  hermit!  ...  A\nbook,  a  pen  behind  your  ear,  a  learned\nresearch-that's where your spirit soars! I am the\nsame  way  myself....  Have  you  read\nLivingstone's Travels?''No.'\n'Oh,  I  have.  There  are  a  great  many  Nihilists\nabout nowadays, you know, and indeed it is not\nto be wondered at. What sort of days are they?\nI  ask  you.  But  we  thought  ...  you  are  not  a\nNihilist of course? Answer me openly, openly!'\n'N-no ...'\n'Believe  me,  you  can  speak  openly  to  me  as", "you would to yourself! Official duty is one thing\nbut ... you are thinking I meant to say friendship\nis  quite  another?  No,  you're  wrong!  It's  not\nfriendship,  but  the  feeling  of  a  man  and  a\ncitizen,  the  feeling  of  humanity  and  of  love  for\nthe  Almighty.  I  may  be  an  official,  but  I  am\nalways  bound  to  feel  myself  a  man  and  a\ncitizen....  You  were  asking  about  Zametov.\nZametov will make a scandal in the French style\nin  a  house  of  bad  reputation,  over  a  glass  of\nchampagne  ...  that's  all  your  Zametov  is  good\nfor! While I'm perhaps, so to speak, burning with\ndevotion and lofty feelings, and besides I have\nrank, conse-(cid:24)(cid:24) quence, a post! I am married and\nhave children, I fulfil the duties of a man and a\ncitizen,  but  who  is  he,  may  I  ask?  I  appeal  to\nyou  as  a  man  ennobled  by  education  ...  Then\nthese  midwives,  too,  have  become\nextraordinarily numerous.'\nRaskolnikov  raised  his  eyebrows  inquiringly.\nThe words of Ilya Petrovitch, who had obviously\nbeen dining, were for the most part a stream of\nempty  sounds  for  him.  But  some  of  them  he\nunderstood.  He  looked  at  him  inquiringly,  not\nknowing how it would end.", "'I  mean  those  crop-headed  wenches,'  the\ntalkative  Ilya  Petrovitch  continued.  'Midwives  is\nmy name for them. I think it a very satisfactory\none,  ha-ha!  They  go  to  the  Academy,  study\nanatomy.  If  I  fall  ill,  am  I  to  send  for  a  young\nlady to treat me? What do you say? Ha-ha!' Ilya\nPetrovitch  laughed,  quite  pleased  with  his  own\nwit.  'It's  an  immoderate  zeal  for  education,  but\nonce  you're  educated,  that's  enough.  Why\nabuse it? Why insult honourable people, as that\nscoundrel  Zametov  does?  Why  did  he  insult\nme, I ask you? Look at these suicides, too, how\ncommon  they  are,  you  can't  fancy!  People\nspend  their  last  halfpenny  and  kill  themselves,\nboys  and  girls  and  old  people.  Only  this\nmorning we heard about a gentleman who had\njust come to town. Nil Pavlitch, I say, what was\nthe name of that gentleman who shot himself?'\n'Svidrigaïlov,'  someone  answered  from  the\nother room with drowsy listlessness.\nRaskolnikov started.\n'Svidrigaïlov!  Svidrigaïlov  has  shot  himself!'  he\ncried.", "'What, do you know Svidrigaïlov?'(cid:24)(cid:24)0 Crime and\nPunishment  'Yes  ...  I  knew  him....  He  hadn't\nbeen here long.'\n'Yes, that's so. He had lost his wife, was a man\nof  reckless  habits  and  all  of  a  sudden  shot\nhimself, and in such a shocking way.... He left in\nhis  notebook  a  few  words:  that  he  dies  in  full\npossession of his faculties and that no one is to\nblame  for  his  death.  He  had  money,  they  say.\nHow did you come to know him?'\n'I ... was acquainted ... my sister was governess\nin his family.'\n'Bah-bah-bah!  Then  no  doubt  you  can  tell  us\nsomething about him. You had no suspicion?'\n'I saw him yesterday ... he ... was drinking wine;\nI knew nothing.'\nRaskolnikov felt as though something had fallen\non him and was stifling him.\n'You've turned pale again. It's so stuffy here ...'\n'Yes, I must go,' muttered Raskolnikov. 'Excuse", "my troubling you....'\n'Oh,  not  at  all,  as  often  as  you  like.  It's  a\npleasure to see you and I am glad to say so.'\nIlya Petrovitch held out his hand.\n'I only wanted ... I came to see Zametov.'\n'I understand, I understand, and it's a pleasure\nto see you.'\n'I  ...  am  very  glad  ...  good-bye,'  Raskolnikov\nsmiled.\nHe went out; he reeled, he was overtaken with\ngiddiness and did not know what he was doing.\nHe  began  going  down  the  stairs,  supporting\nhimself with his right hand against the wall. He\nfancied that a porter pushed past him on his (cid:24)1\nway  upstairs  to  the  police  office,  that  a  dog  in\nthe lower storey kept up a shrill barking and that\na  woman  flung  a  rolling-pin  at  it  and  shouted.\nHe went down and out into the yard. There, not\nfar  from  the  entrance,  stood  Sonia,  pale  and\nhorror-  stricken.  She  looked  wildly  at  him.  He\nstood  still  before  her.  There  was  a  look  of", "poignant  agony,  of  despair,  in  her  face.  She\nclasped  her  hands.  His  lips  worked  in  an  ugly,\nmeaningless  smile.  He  stood  still  a  minute,\ngrinned and went back to the police office.\nIlya  Petrovitch  had  sat  down  and  was\nrummaging  among  some  papers.  Before  him\nstood the same peasant who had pushed by on\nthe stairs.\n'Hulloa!  Back  again!  have  you  left  something\nbehind? What's the matter?'\nRaskolnikov,  with  white  lips  and  staring  eyes,\ncame  slowly  nearer.  He  walked  right  to  the\ntable,  leaned  his  hand  on  it,  tried  to  say\nsomething,  but  could  not;  only  incoherent\nsounds were audible.\n'You  are  feeling  ill,  a  chair!  Here,  sit  down!\nSome water!'\nRaskolnikov dropped on to a chair, but he kept", "his  eyes  fixed  on  the  face  of  Ilya  Petrovitch,\nwhich  expressed  unpleasant  surprise.  Both\nlooked at one another for a minute and waited.\nWater was brought.\n'It was I ...' began \nRaskolnikov.\n'Drink some water.'\nRaskolnikov  refused  the  water  with  his  hand,\nand softly and brokenly, but distinctly said:\n'It  was  I  killed  the  old  pawnbroker  woman  and\nher  sister  Lizaveta  with  an  axe  and  robbed\nthem.'(cid:24)  Ilya  Petrovitch  opened  his  mouth.\nPeople ran up on all sides.\nRaskolnikov repeated his statement.(cid:24)(cid:24) Epilogue(cid:24)\nISiberia.  On  the  banks  of  a  broad  solitary  river\nstands a \ntown,  one  of  the  administrative  centres  of\nRussia;  in  the  town  there  is  a  fortress,  in  the", "fortress  there  is  a  prison.  In  the  prison  the\nsecond-class  convict  Rodion  Raskolnikov  has\nbeen  confined  for  nine  months.  Almost  a  year\nand a half has passed since his crime.\nThere  had  been  little  difficulty  about  his  trial.\nThe criminal adhered exactly, firmly, and clearly\nto  his  statement.  He  did  not  confuse  nor\nmisrepresent  the  facts,  nor  soften  them  in  his\nown  interest,  nor  omit  the  smallest  detail.  He\nexplained  every  incident  of  the  murder,  the\nsecret  of  the  pledge  (the  piece  of  wood  with  a\nstrip of metal) which was found in the murdered\nwoman's  hand.  He  described  minutely  how  he\nhad taken her keys, what they were like, as well\nas the chest and its contents; he explained the\nmystery  of  Lizaveta's  murder;  described  how\nKoch  and,  after  him,  the  student  knocked,  and\nrepeated all they had said to one another; how\nhe  afterwards  had  run  downstairs  and  heard\nNikolay and Dmitri shouting; how he had hidden\nin the empty flat and afterwards gone home. He\nended by indicating the stone in the yard off the\nVoznesensky  Prospect  under  which  the  purse\nand the trinkets were found. The whole thing, in\nfact,  was  perfectly  clear.  The  lawyers  and  the\njudges  were  very  much  struck,  among  other", "things,  by  the  fact  that  he  (cid:24)(cid:24)  had  hidden  the\ntrinkets  and  the  purse  under  a  stone,  without\nmaking use of them, and that, what was more,\nhe  did  not  now  remember  what  the  trinkets\nwere  like,  or  even  how  many  there  were.  The\nfact that he had never opened the purse and did\nnot  even  know  how  much  was  in  it  seemed\nincredible.  There  turned  out  to  be  in  the  purse\nthree hundred and seventeen roubles and sixty\ncopecks.  From  being  so  long  under  the  stone,\nsome  of  the  most  valuable  notes  lying\nuppermost  had  suffered  from  the  damp.  They\nwere  a  long  while  trying  to  discover  why  the\naccused man should tell a lie about this, when\nabout  everything  else  he  had  made  a  truthful\nand straightforward confession. Finally some of\nthe  lawyers  more  versed  in  psychology\nadmitted  that  it  was  possible  he  had  really  not\nlooked into the purse, and so didn't know what\nwas  in  it  when  he  hid  it  under  the  stone.  But\nthey  immediately  drew  the  deduction  that  the\ncrime could only have been committed through\ntemporary  mental  derangement,  through\nhomicidal mania, without object or the pursuit of\ngain.  This  fell  in  with  the  most  recent\nfashionable  theory  of  temporary  insanity,  so\noften  applied  in  our  days  in  criminal  cases.", "Moreover  Raskolnikov's  hypochondriacal\ncondition  was  proved  by  many  witnesses,  by\nDr.  Zossimov,  his  former  fellow  students,  his\nlandlady  and  her  servant.  All  this  pointed\nstrongly to the conclusion that Raskolnikov was\nnot quite like an ordinary murderer and robber,\nbut that there was another element in the case.\nTo  the  intense  annoyance  of  those  who\nmaintained  this  opinion,  the  criminal  scarcely\nattempted  to  defend  himself.  To  the  decisive\nquestion as to what motive impelled him (cid:24) to the\nmurder  and  the  robbery,  he  answered  very\nclearly  with  the  coarsest  frankness  that  the\ncause  was  his  miserable  position,  his  poverty\nand helplessness, and his desire to provide for\nhis  first  steps  in  life  by  the  help  of  the  three\nthousand  roubles  he  had  reckoned  on  finding.\nHe  had  been  led  to  the  murder  through  his\nshallow  and  cowardly  nature,  exasperated\nmoreover  by  privation  and  failure.  To  the\nquestion what led him to confess, he answered\nthat it was his heartfelt repentance. All this was\nalmost coarse....\nThe sentence however was more merciful than\ncould  have  been  expected,  perhaps  partly", "because  the  criminal  had  not  tried  to  justify\nhimself,  but  had  rather  shown  a  desire  to\nexaggerate  his  guilt.  All  the  strange  and\npeculiar circumstances of the crime were taken\ninto  consideration.  There  could  be  no  doubt  of\nthe  abnormal  and  poverty-stricken  condition  of\nthe  criminal  at  the  time.  The  fact  that  he  had\nmade  no  use  of  what  he  had  stolen  was  put\ndown  partly  to  the  effect  of  remorse,  partly  to\nhis abnormal mental condition at the time of the\ncrime.  Incidentally  the  murder  of  Lizaveta\nserved indeed to confirm the last hypothesis: a\nman commits two murders and forgets that the\ndoor is open! Finally, the confession, at the very\nmoment  when  the  case  was  hopelessly\nmuddled by the false evidence given by Nikolay\nthrough  melancholy  and  fanaticism,  and  when,\nmoreover, there were no proofs against the real\ncriminal, no suspicions even (Porfiry Petrovitch\nfully  kept  his  word)  -all  this  did  much  to  soften\nthe  sentence.  Other  circumstances,  too,  in  the\nprisoner's  favour  came  out  quite  unexpectedly.\nRazumihin  somehow  discovered  and  proved\nthat  while  (cid:24)(cid:24)  Raskolnikov  was  at  the  university\nhe  had  helped  a  poor  consumptive  fellow\nstudent  and  had  spent  his  last  penny  on\nsupporting  him  for  six  months,  and  when  this", "student died, leaving a decrepit old father whom\nhe  had  maintained  almost  from  his  thirteenth\nyear,  Raskolnikov  had  got  the  old  man  into  a\nhospital and paid for his funeral when he died.\nRaskolnikov's  landlady  bore  witness,  too,  that\nwhen  they  had  lived  in  another  house  at  Five\nCorners,  Raskolnikov  had  rescued  two  little\nchildren from a house on fire and was burnt in\ndoing  so.  This  was  investigated  and  fairly  well\nconfirmed  by  many  witnesses.  These  facts\nmade an impression in his favour.\nAnd  in  the  end  the  criminal  was,  in\nconsideration  of  extenuating  circumstances,\ncondemned  to  penal  servitude  in  the  second\nclass for a term of eight years only.\nAt  the  very  beginning  of  the  trial  Raskolnikov's\nmother  fell  ill.  Dounia  and  Razumihin  found  it\npossible to get her out of Petersburg during the\ntrial. Razumihin chose a town on the railway not\nfar  from  Petersburg,  so  as  to  be  able  to  follow\nevery  step  of  the  trial  and  at  the  same  time  to\nsee  Avdotya  Romanovna  as  often  as  possible.\nPulcheria Alexandrovna's illness was a strange\nnervous one and was accompanied by a partial\nderangement of her intellect.", "When  Dounia  returned  from  her  last  interview\nwith  her  brother,  she  had  found  her  mother\nalready  ill,  in  feverish  delirium.  That  evening\nRazumihin  and  she  agreed  what  answers  they\nmust  make  to  her  mother's  questions  about\nRaskolnikov and made up a complete story for\nher mother's benefit of his having to go away to\na  distant  part  of  Russia  (cid:24)  on  a  business\ncommission,  which  would  bring  him  in  the  end\nmoney and reputation.\nBut  they  were  struck  by  the  fact  that  Pulcheria\nAlexandrovna  never  asked  them  anything  on\nthe subject, neither then nor thereafter. On the\ncontrary, she had her own version of her son's\nsudden departure; she told them with tears how\nhe  had  come  to  say  good-bye  to  her,  hinting\nthat  she  alone  knew  many  mysterious  and\nimportant facts, and that Rodya had many very\npowerful enemies, so that it was necessary for\nhim to be in hiding. As for his future career, she\nhad  no  doubt  that  it  would  be  brilliant  when\ncertain  sinister  influences  could  be  removed.\nShe  assured  Razumihin  that  her  son  would  be\none day a great statesman, that his article and\nbrilliant literary talent proved it. This article she", "was continually reading, she even read it aloud,\nalmost  took  it  to  bed  with  her,  but  scarcely\nasked  where  Rodya  was,  though  the  subject\nwas  obviously  avoided  by  the  others,  which\nmight  have  been  enough  to  awaken  her\nsuspicions.\nThey began to be frightened at last at Pulcheria\nAlexandrovna's  strange  silence  on  certain\nsubjects. She did not, for instance, complain of\ngetting  no  letters  from  him,  though  in  previous\nyears she had only lived on the hope of letters\nfrom her beloved Rodya. This was the cause of\ngreat  uneasiness  to  Dounia;  the  idea  occurred\nto her that her mother suspected that there was\nsomething  terrible  in  her  son's  fate  and  was\nafraid to ask, for fear of hearing something still\nmore  awful.  In  any  case,  Dounia  saw  clearly\nthat her mother was not in full possession of her\nfaculties.\nIt  happened  once  or  twice,  however,  that\nPulcheria Al-(cid:24)(cid:24) exandrovna gave such a turn to\nthe  conversation  that  it  was  impossible  to\nanswer  her  without  mentioning  where  Rodya\nwas,  and  on  receiving  unsatisfactory  and\nsuspicious  answers  she  became  at  once", "gloomy  and  silent,  and  this  mood  lasted  for  a\nlong time. Dounia saw at last that it was hard to\ndeceive  her  and  came  to  the  conclusion  that  it\nwas  better  to  be  absolutely  silent  on  certain\npoints;  but  it  became  more  and  more  evident\nthat  the  poor  mother  suspected  something\nterrible.  Dounia  remembered  her  brother's\ntelling  her  that  her  mother  had  overheard  her\ntalking  in  her  sleep  on  the  night  after  her\ninterview  with  Svidrigaïlov  and  before  the  fatal\nday  of  the  confession:  had  not  she  made  out\nsomething  from  that?  Sometimes  days  and\neven weeks of gloomy silence and tears would\nbe  succeeded  by  a  period  of  hysterical\nanimation,  and  the  invalid  would  begin  to  talk\nalmost  incessantly  of  her  son,  of  her  hopes  of\nhis  future....  Her  fancies  were  sometimes  very\nstrange.  They  humoured  her,  pretended  to\nagree with her (she saw perhaps that they were\npretending), but she still went on talking.\nFive months after Raskolnikov's confession, he\nwas sentenced. Razumihin and Sonia saw him\nin prison as often as it was possible. At last the\nmoment  of  separation  came.  Dounia  swore  to\nher brother that the separation should not be for\never,  Razumihin  did  the  same.  Razumihin,  in", "his  youthful  ardour,  had  firmly  resolved  to  lay\nthe  foundations  at  least  of  a  secure  livelihood\nduring the next three or four years, and saving\nup  a  certain  sum,  to  emigrate  to  Siberia,  a\ncountry  rich  in  every  natural  resource  and  in\nneed of workers, active men and capital. There\nthey  would  settle  in  the  (cid:24)(cid:24)0  Crime  and\nPunishment  town  where  Rodya  was  and  all\ntogether  would  begin  a  new  life.  They  all  wept\nat parting.\nRaskolnikov  had  been  very  dreamy  for  a  few\ndays  before.  He  asked  a  great  deal  about  his\nmother  and  was  constantly  anxious  about  her.\nHe  worried  so  much  about  her  that  it  alarmed\nDounia.  When  he  heard  about  his  mother's\nillness  he  became  very  gloomy.  With  Sonia  he\nwas  particularly  reserved  all  the  time.  With  the\nhelp  of  the  money  left  to  her  by  Svidrigaïlov,\nSonia  had  long  ago  made  her  preparations  to\nfollow  the  party  of  convicts  in  which  he  was\ndespatched  to  Siberia.  Not  a  word  passed\nbetween  Raskolnikov  and  her  on  the  subject,\nbut  both  knew  it  would  be  so.  At  the  final\nleavetaking  he  smiled  strangely  at  his  sister's\nand  Razumihin's  fervent  anticipations  of  their\nhappy future together when he should come out", "of  prison.  He  predicted  that  their  mother's\nillness  would  soon  have  a  fatal  ending.  Sonia\nand he at last set off.\nTwo  months  later  Dounia  was  married  to\nRazumihin.  It  was  a  quiet  and  sorrowful\nwedding; Porfiry Petrovitch and Zossimov were\ninvited  however.  During  all  this  period\nRazumihin  wore  an  air  of  resolute\ndetermination.  Dounia  put  implicit  faith  in  his\ncarrying out his plans and indeed she could not\nbut believe in him. He displayed a rare strength\nof will. Among other things he began attending\nuniversity  lectures  again  in  order  to  take  his\ndegree. They were continually making plans for\nthe  future;  both  counted  on  settling  in  Siberia\nwithin  five  years  at  least.  Till  then  they  rested\ntheir hopes on Sonia.\nPulcheria  Alexandrovna  was  delighted  to  give\nher  bless-(cid:24)1  ing  to  Dounia's  marriage  with\nRazumihin;  but  after  the  marriage  she  became\neven more melancholy and anxious. To give her\npleasure  Razumihin  told  her  how  Raskolnikov\nhad  looked  after  the  poor  student  and  his\ndecrepit father and how a year ago he had been\nburnt  and  injured  in  rescuing  two  little  children", "from  a  fire.  These  two  pieces  of  news  excited\nPulcheria  Alexandrovna's  disordered\nimagination  almost  to  ecstasy.  She  was\ncontinually  talking  about  them,  even  entering\ninto  conversation  with  strangers  in  the  street,\nthough  Dounia  always  accompanied  her.  In\npublic  conveyances  and  shops,  wherever  she\ncould  capture  a  listener,  she  would  begin  the\ndiscourse about her son, his article, how he had\nhelped  the  student,  how  he  had  been  burnt  at\nthe fire, and so on! Dounia did not know how to\nrestrain  her.  Apart  from  the  danger  of  her\nmorbid  excitement,  there  was  the  risk  of\nsomeone's  recalling  Raskolnikov's  name  and\nspeaking  of  the  recent  trial.  Pulcheria\nAlexandrovna  found  out  the  address  of  the\nmother  of  the  two  children  her  son  had  saved\nand insisted on going to see her.\nAt  last  her  restlessness  reached  an  extreme\npoint.  She  would  sometimes  begin  to  cry\nsuddenly  and  was  often  ill  and  feverishly\ndelirious. One morning she declared that by her\nreckoning  Rodya  ought  soon  to  be  home,  that\nshe remembered when he said good-bye to her\nhe said that they must expect him back in nine\nmonths.  She  began  to  prepare  for  his  coming,", "began  to  do  up  her  room  for  him,  to  clean  the\nfurniture, to wash and put up new hangings and\nso  on.  Dounia  was  anxious,  but  said  nothing\nand  helped  her  to  arrange  the  room.  After  a\nfatiguing  day  spent  in  continual  (cid:24)  fancies,  in\njoyful  day-dreams  and  tears,  Pulcheria\nAlexandrovna  was  taken  ill  in  the  night  and  by\nmorning  she  was  feverish  and  delirious.  It  was\nbrain  fever.  She  died  within  a  fortnight.  In  her\ndelirium she dropped words which showed that\nshe  knew  a  great  deal  more  about  her  son's\nterrible fate than they had supposed.\nFor a long time Raskolnikov did not know of his\nmother's    death,    though    a    regular \ncorrespondence  had  been maintained from the\ntime  he  reached  Siberia.  It  was  carried  on  by\nmeans of Sonia, who wrote every month to the\nRazumihins  and  received  an  answer  with\nunfailing  regularity.  At  first  they  found  Sonia's\nletters dry and unsatisfactory, but later on they\ncame to the conclusion that the letters could not\nbe better, for from these letters they received a\ncomplete  picture  of  their  unfortunate  brother's\nlife.  Sonia's  letters  were  full  of  the  most\nmatter-of-fact  detail,  the  simplest  and  clearest\ndescription of all Raskolnikov's surroundings as", "a convict. There was no word of her own hopes,\nno conjecture as to the future, no description of\nher feelings. Instead of any attempt to interpret\nhis  state  of  mind  and  inner  life,  she  gave  the\nsimple  facts-that  is,  his  own  words,  an  exact\naccount of his health, what he asked for at their\ninterviews,  what  commission  he  gave  her  and\nso  on.  All  these  facts  she  gave  with\nextraordinary  minuteness.  The  picture  of  their\nunhappy  brother  stood  out  at  last  with  great\nclearness  and  precision.  There  could  be  no\nmistake, because nothing was given but facts.\nBut  Dounia  and  her  husband  could  get  little\ncomfort  out  of  the  news,  especially  at  first.\nSonia  wrote  that  he  was  con-(cid:24)(cid:24)  stantly  sullen\nand not ready to talk, that he scarcely seemed\ninterested in the news she gave him from their\nletters,  that  he  sometimes  asked  after  his\nmother  and  that  when,  seeing  that  he  had\nguessed  the  truth,  she  told  him  at  last  of  her\ndeath, she was surprised to find that he did not\nseem greatly affected by it, not externally at any\nrate.  She  told  them  that,  although  he  seemed\nso wrapped up in himself and, as it were, shut\nhimself off from everyone-he took a very direct\nand  simple  view  of  his  new  life;  that  he", "understood his position, expected nothing better\nfor the time, had no ill-founded hopes (as is so\ncommon  in  his  position)  and  scarcely  seemed\nsurprised  at  anything  in  his  surroundings,  so\nunlike  anything  he  had  known  before.  She\nwrote that his health was satisfactory; he did his\nwork without shirking or seeking to do more; he\nwas almost indifferent about food, but except on\nSundays and holidays the food was so bad that\nat last he had been glad to accept some money\nfrom her, Sonia, to have his own tea every day.\nHe  begged  her  not  to  trouble  about  anything\nelse, declaring that all this fuss about him only\nannoyed him. Sonia wrote further that in prison\nhe shared the same room with the rest, that she\nhad  not  seen  the  inside  of  their  barracks,  but\nconcluded  that  they  were  crowded,  miserable\nand unhealthy; that he slept on a plank bed with\na rug under him and was unwilling to make any\nother  arrangement.  But  that  he  lived  so  poorly\nand  roughly,  not  from  any  plan  or  design,  but\nsimply from inattention and indifference.\nSonia wrote simply that he had at first shown no\ninterest  in  her  visits,  had  almost  been  vexed\nwith  her  indeed  for  (cid:24)  coming,  unwilling  to  talk\nand rude to her. But that in the end these visits", "had become a habit and almost a necessity for\nhim, so that he was positively distressed when\nshe  was  ill  for  some  days  and  could  not  visit\nhim.  She  used  to  see  him  on  holidays  at  the\nprison gates or in the guard-room, to which he\nwas  brought  for  a  few  minutes  to  see  her.  On\nworking days she would go to see him at work\neither at the workshops or at the brick kilns, or\nat the sheds on the banks of the Irtish.\nAbout  herself,  Sonia  wrote  that  she  had\nsucceeded  in  making  some  acquaintances  in\nthe  town,  that  she  did  sewing,  and,  as  there\nwas  scarcely  a  dressmaker  in  the  town,  she\nwas looked upon as an indispensable person in\nmany houses. But she did not mention that the\nauthorities  were,  through  her,  interested  in\nRaskolnikov; that his task was lightened and so\non.\nAt  last  the  news  came  (Dounia  had  indeed\nnoticed  signs  of  alarm  and  uneasiness  in  the\npreceding  letters)  that  he  held  aloof  from\neveryone,  that  his  fellow  prisoners  did  not  like\nhim,  that  he  kept  silent  for  days  at  a  time  and\nwas becoming very pale. In the last letter Sonia\nwrote  that  he  had  been  taken  very  seriously  ill", "and  was  in  the  convict  ward  of  the  hospital.(cid:24)(cid:24)\nIIHe  was  ill  a  long  time.  But  it  was  not  the\nhorrors  of  prison  life,  not  the  hard  labour,  the\nbad  food,  the  shaven  head,  or  the  patched\nclothes that crushed him. What did he care for\nall those trials and hardships! he was even glad\nof  the  hard  work.  Physically  exhausted,  he\ncould  at  least  reckon  on  a  few  hours  of  quiet\nsleep.  And  what  was  the  food  to  him-the  thin\ncabbage soup with beetles floating in it? In the\npast  as  a  student  he  had  often  not  had  even\nthat.  His  clothes  were  warm  and  suited  to  his\nmanner of life. He did not even feel the fetters.\nWas  he  ashamed  of  his  shaven  head  and\nparti-coloured  coat?  Before  whom?  Before\nSonia?  Sonia  was  afraid  of  him,  how  could  he\nbe  ashamed  before  her?  And  yet  he  was\nashamed even before Sonia, whom he tortured\nbecause  of  it  with  his  contemptuous  rough\nmanner. But it was not his shaven head and his\nfetters he was ashamed of: his pride had been\nstung  to  the  quick.  It  was  wounded  pride  that\nmade  him  ill.  Oh,  how  happy  he  would  have\nbeen if he could have blamed himself! He could\nhave  borne  anything  then,  even  shame  and\ndisgrace.  But  he  judged  himself  severely,  and\nhis  exasperated  conscience  found  no", "particularly  terrible  fault  in  his  past,  except  a\nsimple blunder which might happen to anyone.\nHe was ashamed just because he, Raskolnikov,\nhad  so  hopelessly,  stupidly  come  to  grief\nthrough  some  decree  of  blind  fate,  and  must\nhumble (cid:24) himself and submit to 'the idiocy' of a\nsentence, if he were anyhow to be at peace.\nVague  and  objectless  anxiety  in  the  present,\nand in the future a continual sacrifice leading to\nnothing-that  was  all  that  lay  before  him.  And\nwhat  comfort  was  it  to  him  that  at  the  end  of\neight years he would only be thirty-two and able\nto  begin  a  new  life!  What  had  he  to  live  for?\nWhat had he to look forward to? Why should he\nstrive?  To  live  in  order  to  exist?  Why,  he  had\nbeen ready a thousand times before to give up\nexistence  for  the  sake  of  an  idea,  for  a  hope,\neven  for  a  fancy.  Mere  existence  had  always\nbeen  too  little  for  him;  he  had  always  wanted\nmore.  Perhaps  it  was  just  because  of  the\nstrength  of  his  desires  that  he  had  thought\nhimself  a  man  to  whom  more  was  permissible\nthan to others.\nAnd  if  only  fate  would  have  sent  him\nrepentance-burning repentance that would have", "torn  his  heart  and  robbed  him  of  sleep,  that\nrepentance,  the  awful  agony  of  which  brings\nvisions  of  hanging  or  drowning!  Oh,  he  would\nhave been glad of it! Tears and agonies would\nat least have been life. But he did not repent of\nhis crime.\nAt least he might have found relief in raging at\nhis stupidity, as he had raged at the grotesque\nblunders  that  had  brought  him  to  prison.  But\nnow  in  prison,  in  freedom  he  thought  over  and\ncriticised all his actions again and by no means\nfound them so blundering and so grotesque as\nthey had seemed at the fatal time.\n'In what way,' he asked himself, 'was my theory\nstupider  than  others  that  have  swarmed  and\nclashed  from  the  beginning  of  the  world?  One\nhas  only  to  look  at  the  thing  quite  (cid:24)(cid:24)\nindependently,  broadly,  and  uninfluenced  by\ncommonplace  ideas,  and  my  idea  will  by  no\nmeans  seem  so  ...  strange.  Oh,  sceptics  and\nhalfpenny  philosophers,  why  do  you  halt\nhalf-way!'\n'Why  does  my  action  strike  them  as  so\nhorrible?'  he  said  to  himself.  'Is  it  because  it", "was  a  crime?  What  is  meant  by  crime?  My\nconscience is at rest. Of course, it was a legal\ncrime,  of  course,  the  letter  of  the  law  was\nbroken  and  blood  was  shed.  Well,  punish  me\nfor the letter of the law ... and that's enough. Of\ncourse, in that case many of the benefactors of\nmankind  who  snatched  power  for  themselves\ninstead  of  inheriting  it  ought  to  have  been\npunished  at  their  first  steps.  But  those  men\nsucceeded and so they were right and I didn't,\nand so I had no right to have taken that step.'\nIt  was  only  in  that  that  he  recognised  his\ncriminality,  only  in  the  fact  that  he  had  been\nunsuccessful and had confessed it.\nHe suffered too from the question: why had he\nnot killed himself? Why had he stood looking at\nthe  river  and  preferred  to  confess?  Was  the\ndesire  to  live  so  strong  and  was  it  so  hard  to\novercome it? Had not Svidrigaïlov overcome it,\nalthough he was afraid of death?\nIn  misery  he  asked  himself  this  question,  and\ncould  not  understand  that,  at  the  very  time  he\nhad been standing looking into the river, he had\nperhaps  been  dimly  conscious  of  the", "fundamental  falsity  in  himself  and  his\nconvictions.  He  didn't  understand  that  that\nconsciousness might be the promise of a future\ncrisis,  of  a  new  view  of  life  and  of  his  future\nresurrection.(cid:24)  He  preferred  to  attribute  it  to  the\ndead weight of instinct which he could not step\nover,  again  through  weakness  and  meanness.\nHe  looked  at  his  fellow  prisoners  and  was\namazed to see how they all loved life and prized\nit. It seemed to him that they loved and valued\nlife  more  in  prison  than  in  freedom.  What\nterrible  agonies  and  privations  some  of  them,\nthe  tramps  for  instance,  had  endured!  Could\nthey care so much for a ray of sunshine, for the\nprimeval forest, the cold spring hidden away in\nsome  unseen  spot,  which  the  tramp  had\nmarked  three  years  before,  and  longed  to  see\nagain,  as  he  might  to  see  his  sweetheart,\ndreaming  of  the  green  grass  round  it  and  the\nbird singing in the bush? As he went on he saw\nstill more inexplicable examples.\nIn prison, of course, there was a great deal he\ndid not see and did not want to see; he lived as\nit  were  with  downcast  eyes.  It  was  loathsome\nand  unbearable  for  him  to  look.  But  in  the  end\nthere  was  much  that  surprised  him  and  he", "began,  as  it  were  involuntarily,  to  notice  much\nthat  he  had  not  suspected  before.  What\nsurprised  him  most  of  all  was  the  terrible\nimpossible gulf that lay between him and all the\nrest.  They  seemed  to  be  a  different  species,\nand  he  looked  at  them  and  they  at  him  with\ndistrust  and  hostility.  He  felt  and  knew  the\nreasons  of  his  isolation,  but  he  would  never\nhave admitted till then that those reasons were\nso  deep  and  strong.  There  were  some  Polish\nexiles,  political  prisoners,  among  them.  They\nsimply  looked  down  upon  all  the  rest  as\nignorant churls; but Raskolnikov could not look\nupon them like that. He saw that these ignorant\nmen  were  in  many  respects  far  wiser  than  the\nPoles. There were some Russians (cid:24)(cid:24) who were\njust as contemptuous, a former officer and two\nseminarists.  Raskolnikov  saw  their  mistake  as\nclearly.  He  was  disliked  and  avoided  by\neveryone;  they  even  began  to  hate  him  at\nlast-why,  he  could  not  tell.  Men  who  had  been\nfar  more  guilty  despised  and  laughed  at  his\ncrime.\n'You're  a  gentleman,'  they  used  to  say.  'You\nshouldn't  hack  about  with  an  axe;  that's  not  a\ngentleman's work.'", "The second week in Lent, his turn came to take\nthe sacrament with his gang. He went to church\nand prayed with the others. A quarrel broke out\none day, he did not know how. All fell on him at\nonce in a fury.\n'You're  an  infidel!  You  don't  believe  in  God,'\nthey shouted. 'You ought to be killed.'\nHe had never talked to them about God nor his\nbelief, but they wanted to kill him as an infidel.\nHe said nothing. One of the prisoners rushed at\nhim  in  a  perfect  frenzy.  Raskolnikov  awaited\nhim  calmly  and  silently;  his  eyebrows  did  not\nquiver,  his  face  did  not  flinch.  The  guard\nsucceeded  in  intervening  between  him  and  his\nassailant, or there would have been bloodshed.\nThere  was  another  question  he  could  not\ndecide: why were they all so fond of Sonia? She\ndid  not  try  to  win  their  favour;  she  rarely  met\nthem,  sometimes  only  she  came  to  see  him  at\nwork  for  a  moment.  And  yet  everybody  knew\nher, they knew that she had come out to follow\nhim knew how and where she lived. She never\ngave  them  money,  did  them  no  particular", "services. Only once at Christmas she sent them\nall  presents  of  pies  and  rolls.  But  by  degrees\ncloser  relations  sprang  up  between  them  and\nSonia.  She  would  (cid:24)(cid:24)0  Crime  and  Punishment\nwrite and post letters for them to their relations.\nRelations of the prisoners who visited the town,\nat their instructions, left with Sonia presents and\nmoney  for  them.  Their  wives  and  sweethearts\nknew  her  and  used  to  visit  her.  And  when  she\nvisited  Raskolnikov  at  work,  or  met  a  party  of\nthe prisoners on the road, they all took off their\nhats  to  her.  'Little  mother  Sofya  Semyonovna,\nyou  are  our  dear,  good  little  mother,'  coarse\nbranded criminals said to that frail little creature.\nShe would smile and bow to them and everyone\nwas  delighted  when  she  smiled.  They  even\nadmired her gait and turned round to watch her\nwalking; they admired her too for being so little,\nand,  in  fact,  did  not  know  what  to  admire  her\nmost for. They even came to her for help in their\nillnesses.\nHe was in the hospital from the middle of Lent\ntill  after  Easter.  When  he  was  better,  he\nremembered  the  dreams  he  had  had  while  he\nwas  feverish  and  delirious.  He  dreamt  that  the\nwhole  world  was  condemned  to  a  terrible  new", "strange  plague  that  had  come  to  Europe  from\nthe  depths  of  Asia.  All  were  to  be  destroyed\nexcept  a  very  few  chosen.  Some  new  sorts  of\nmicrobes were attacking the bodies of men, but\nthese microbes were endowed with intelligence\nand will. Men attacked by them became at once\nmad  and  furious.  But  never  had  men\nconsidered  themselves  so  intellectual  and  so\ncompletely  in  possession  of  the  truth  as  these\nsufferers,  never  had  they  considered  their\ndecisions,  their  scientific  conclusions,  their\nmoral  convictions  so  infallible.  Whole  villages,\nwhole  towns  and  peoples  went  mad  from  the\ninfection.  All  were  excited  and  did  not\nunderstand  (cid:24)1  one  another.  Each  thought  that\nhe  alone  had  the  truth  and  was  wretched\nlooking  at  the  others,  beat  himself  on  the\nbreast, wept, and wrung his hands. They did not\nknow how to judge and could not agree what to\nconsider evil and what good; they did not know\nwhom  to  blame,  whom  to  justify.  Men  killed\neach  other  in  a  sort  of  senseless  spite.  They\ngathered  together  in  armies  against  one\nanother,  but  even  on  the  march  the  armies\nwould  begin  attacking  each  other,  the  ranks\nwould be broken and the soldiers would fall on\neach  other,  stabbing  and  cutting,  biting  and", "devouring  each  other.  The  alarm  bell  was\nringing  all  day  long  in  the  towns;  men  rushed\ntogether,  but  why  they  were  summoned  and\nwho  was  summoning  them  no  one  knew.  The\nmost ordinary trades were abandoned, because\neveryone  proposed  his  own  ideas,  his  own\nimprovements,  and  they  could  not  agree.  The\nland  too  was  abandoned.  Men  met  in  groups,\nagreed  on  something,  swore  to  keep  together,\nbut at once began on something quite different\nfrom  what  they  had  proposed.  They  accused\none  another,  fought  and  killed  each  other.\nThere were conflagrations and famine. All men\nand all things were involved in destruction. The\nplague  spread  and  moved  further  and  further.\nOnly  a  few  men  could  be  saved  in  the  whole\nworld.  They  were  a  pure  chosen  people,\ndestined to found a new race and a new life, to\nrenew and purify the earth, but no one had seen\nthese  men,  no  one  had  heard  their  words  and\ntheir voices.\nRaskolnikov  was  worried  that  this  senseless \ndream  haunted  his  memory  so  miserably,  the\nimpression of this feverish delirium persisted so\nlong. The second week after (cid:24) Easter had come.\nThere  were  warm  bright  spring  days;  in  the", "prison  ward  the  grating  windows  under  which\nthe  sentinel  paced  were  opened.  Sonia  had\nonly  been  able  to  visit  him  twice  during  his\nillness; each time she had to obtain permission,\nand it was difficult. But she often used to come\nto  the  hospital  yard,  especially  in  the  evening,\nsometimes  only  to  stand  a  minute  and  look  up\nat the windows of the ward.\nOne  evening,  when  he  was  almost  well  again,\nRaskolnikov  fell  asleep.  On  waking  up  he\nchanced to go to the window, and at once saw\nSonia  in  the  distance  at  the  hospital  gate.  She\nseemed to be waiting for someone. Something\nstabbed  him  to  the  heart  at  that  minute.  He\nshuddered  and  moved  away  from  the  window.\nNext day Sonia did not come, nor the day after;\nhe noticed that he was expecting her uneasily.\nAt  last  he  was  discharged.  On  reaching  the\nprison  he  learnt  from  the  convicts  that  Sofya\nSemyonovna  was  lying  ill  at  home  and  was\nunable to go out.\nHe  was  very  uneasy  and  sent  to  inquire  after\nher;  he  soon  learnt  that  her  illness  was  not\ndangerous. Hearing that he was anxious about\nher, Sonia sent him a pencilled note, telling him", "that she was much better, that she had a slight\ncold and that she would soon, very soon come\nand  see  him  at  his  work.  His  heart  throbbed\npainfully as he read it.\nAgain  it  was  a  warm  bright  day.  Early  in  the\nmorning,  at  six  o'clock,  he  went  off  to  work  on\nthe  river  bank,  where  they  used  to  pound\nalabaster and where there was a kiln for baking\nit in a shed. There were only three of them sent.\nOne of the convicts went with the guard to the\nfortress to (cid:24)(cid:24) fetch a tool; the other began getting\nthe  wood  ready  and  laying  it  in  the  kiln.\nRaskolnikov  came  out  of  the  shed  on  to  the\nriver  bank,  sat  down  on  a  heap  of  logs  by  the\nshed  and  began  gazing  at  the  wide  deserted\nriver.  From  the  high  bank  a  broad  landscape\nopened before him, the sound of singing floated\nfaintly  audible  from  the  other  bank.  In  the  vast\nsteppe,  bathed  in  sunshine,  he  could  just  see,\nlike  black  specks,  the  nomads'  tents.  There\nthere was freedom, there other men were living,\nutterly  unlike  those  here;  there  time  itself\nseemed  to  stand  still,  as  though  the  age  of\nAbraham  and  his  flocks  had  not  passed.\nRaskolnikov  sat  gazing,  his  thoughts  passed\ninto day-dreams, into contemplation; he thought", "of  nothing,  but  a  vague  restlessness  excited\nand  troubled  him.  Suddenly  he  found  Sonia\nbeside  him;  she  had  come  up  noiselessly  and\nsat down at his side. It was still quite early; the\nmorning chill was still keen. She wore her poor\nold burnous and the green shawl; her face still\nshowed  signs  of  illness,  it  was  thinner  and\npaler. She gave him a joyful smile of welcome,\nbut  held  out  her  hand  with  her  usual  timidity.\nShe was always timid of holding out her hand to\nhim  and  sometimes  did  not  offer  it  at  all,  as\nthough afraid he would repel it. He always took\nher  hand  as  though  with  repugnance,  always\nseemed vexed to meet her and was sometimes\nobstinately  silent  throughout  her  visit.\nSometimes  she  trembled  before  him  and  went\naway  deeply  grieved.  But  now  their  hands  did\nnot  part.  He  stole  a  rapid  glance  at  her  and\ndropped  his  eyes  on  the  ground  without\nspeaking.  They  were  alone,  no  one  had  seen\nthem. The guard had turned away for the time.(cid:24)\nHow  it  happened  he  did  not  know.  But  all  at\nonce something seemed to seize him and fling\nhim  at  her  feet.  He  wept  and  threw  his  arms\nround  her  knees.  For  the  first  instant  she  was\nterribly  frightened  and  she  turned  pale.  She\njumped up and looked at him trembling. But at", "the  same  moment  she  understood,  and  a  light\nof  infinite  happiness  came  into  her  eyes.  She\nknew  and  had  no  doubt  that  he  loved  her\nbeyond everything and that at last the moment\nhad come....\nThey  wanted  to  speak,  but  could  not;  tears\nstood  in  their  eyes.  They  were  both  pale  and\nthin; but those sick pale faces were bright with\nthe dawn of a new future, of a full resurrection\ninto a new life. They were renewed by love; the\nheart of each held infinite sources of life for the\nheart of the other.\nThey resolved to wait and be patient. They had\nanother  seven  years  to  wait,  and  what  terrible\nsuffering  and  what  infinite  happiness  before\nthem!  But  he  had  risen  again  and  he  knew  it\nand  felt  it  in  all  his  being,  while  she-she  only\nlived in his life.\nOn  the  evening  of  the  same  day,  when  the\nbarracks  were  locked,  Raskolnikov  lay  on  his\nplank  bed  and  thought  of  her.  He  had  even\nfancied  that  day  that  all  the  convicts  who  had\nbeen  his  enemies  looked  at  him  differently;  he\nhad  even  entered  into  talk  with  them  and  they", "answered  him  in  a  friendly  way.  He\nremembered  that  now,  and  thought  it  was\nbound  to  be  so.  Wasn't  everything  now  bound\nto be changed?\nHe  thought  of  her.  He  remembered  how\ncontinually he had tormented her and wounded\nher  heart.  He  remembered  (cid:24)(cid:24)  her  pale  and  thin\nlittle  face.  But  these  recollections  scarcely\ntroubled  him  now;  he  knew  with  what  infinite\nlove he would now repay all her sufferings. And\nwhat  were  all,  all  the  agonies  of  the  past!\nEverything,  even  his  crime,  his  sentence  and\nimprisonment,  seemed  to  him  now  in  the  first\nrush  of  feeling  an  external,  strange  fact  with\nwhich he had no concern. But he could not think\nfor  long  together  of  anything  that  evening,  and\nhe  could  not  have  analysed  anything\nconsciously;  he  was  simply  feeling.  Life  had\nstepped into the place of theory and something\nquite different would work itself out in his mind.\nUnder  his  pillow  lay  the  New  Testament.  He\ntook  it  up  mechanically.  The  book  belonged  to\nSonia; it was the one from which she had read\nthe  raising  of  Lazarus  to  him.  At  first  he  was\nafraid  that  she  would  worry  him  about  religion,", "would talk about the gospel and pester him with\nbooks.  But  to  his  great  surprise  she  had  not\nonce approached the subject and had not even\noffered  him  the  Testament.  He  had  asked  her\nfor it himself not long before his illness and she\nbrought  him  the  book  without  a  word.  Till  now\nhe had not opened it.\nHe did not open it now, but one thought passed\nthrough  his  mind:  'Can  her  convictions  not  be\nmine  now?  Her  feelings,  her  aspirations  at\nleast....'\nShe too had been greatly agitated that day, and\nat night she was taken ill again. But she was so\nhappy-and so unexpectedly happy-that she was\nalmost  frightened  of  her  happiness.  Seven\nyears,  only  seven  years!  At  the  beginning  of\ntheir  happiness  at  some  moments  they  were\nboth  ready  (cid:24)  to  look  on  those  seven  years  as\nthough they were seven days. He did not know\nthat  the  new  life  would  not  be  given  him  for\nnothing, that he would have to pay dearly for it,\nthat  it  would  cost  him  great  striving,  great\nsuffering.\nBut  that  is  the  beginning  of  a  new  story-the", "story of the gradual renewal of a man, the story\nof his gradual regeneration, of his passing from\none  world  into  another,  of  his  initiation  into  a\nnew unknown life. That might be the subject of\na new story, but our present story is ended.(cid:24)(cid:24)"]
