You will be given a word and a paragraph in which the word is used. Your task is to explain the meaning of the word specifically in the context of the paragraph, but in a way that would be easy for a child to understand. Focus on how the word is being used in that particular situation and use simple language, examples, or comparisons to make it clear.

### Examples

Word: "perplexed"

Contextualized Meaning: In this paragraph, "perplexed" means Sarah was really confused because she didn’t understand which way to go. It’s like when you don’t know how to finish a game and you’re not sure what to do next.

Word: "melancholy"

Word: "frugal"
Paragraph: Although Henry could afford to buy expensive clothes, he chose to live frugally, always looking for sales and wearing his clothes until they were worn out.
