# Final-Year-Project (Milestone Plan)
## Project Title: AI-Enhanced Book reading powered by Vision and Language models

### Overview:
This document outlines the milestones and key deliverables for the next seven months of the project. Each monthâ€™s goal is broken into weekly tasks to ensure timely progress.

## Month 1: Research and Ideation
Goal: Conduct literature review, and finalize project scope.
### Week 1-2:

Conduct a thorough literature review to find any similar ideas online. Find relevant research papers and compare our designs with theirs and out improvements

### Week 3:

Start the first chapter of your documentation, focusing on the "Overview" and "Litertaure Review" sections.

### Week 4:

Present the deliverables and findings to supervisor, and seek advise for next steps 



## Month 2: System Design & Initial Prototyping
Goal: Define system architecture, finalize feature set, and develop a basic prototype.

### Week 1:

Design the system architecture, including key components such as LLM integration, vision-based scene visualization, and UI/UX layout.
Finalize technology stack (Flask for backend, LLM for text processing, vision model for visualization).
### Week 2:

Create wireframes and user flow diagrams for the platform.
Develop a static frontend layout for the reading interface.
### Week 3:

Implement a basic backend that can process user-input text.
Load a small-scale language model (e.g., GPT-2) for initial testing.
### Week 4:

Integrate a basic text-to-visualization pipeline.
Document the progress and discuss feedback with the supervisor.
