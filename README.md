# Final-Year-Project (Milestone Plan)
## Project Title: AI-Enhanced Book reading powered by Vision and Language models

### Overview:
This document outlines the milestones and key deliverables for the next seven months of the project. Each monthâ€™s goal is broken into weekly tasks to ensure timely progress.

## Month 1: Research and Ideation
Goal: Conduct literature review, and finalize project scope.
### Week 1-2:Project Selection & Proposal Submission

Conducted research to identify potential project ideas.
Finalized the AI-Enhanced Book Reading concept.
Defined the project's problem statement, objectives, and significance.
Submitted the FYP proposal for approval.

### Week 3-4: Overview & Literature Review 

Started the first of documentation, focusing on the "Overview" and Introduction what the project is about.
Conducted an in-depth literature review on similar platforms, AI models, and existing research.
Identified gaps in existing solutions and refined the unique features of the project. Discuss with the supervisor.

## Month 2: Model Selection
Goal: Conduct do thorough research and finalize datsets and model.
### Week 5-6: Gaps

Identified gaps in existing solutions and refined the unique features of the project.
Present the deliverables and findings to supervisor, and seek advise for next steps 

### Week 7-8: Datasets &  Model Selection

Search textual datasets (novels, book summaries, and theme-based data).
Chose different models for text processing and try and find the optimal one.
Fyp Mid Term Thesis Submition. Discuss with the supervisor.

## Month 3: System Design & Initial Prototyping
Goal: Define system architecture, finalize feature set.
### Week 9-10: Finalizing Features

Finalize Features to work on.
Finalize technology stack (Flask for backend, LLM for text processing, vision model for visualization).

### Week 11-12: System Architecture

Create wireframes and user flow diagrams, use case and design for the platform.
Work on the methodology chapter of the thesis. Discuss with the supervisor.


## Month 4: System Design & Initial Prototyping
Goal: Implement 45% of the AI services.
### Week 13-14: Design

Implement a basic backend that can process user-input text.
Load a small-scale language model (e.g., GPT-2) for initial testing.

### Week 15-16: Visualization

Integrate a basic text-to-visualization pipeline.
Document the progress and discuss feedback with the supervisor.
Fyp Final Term Defence.
